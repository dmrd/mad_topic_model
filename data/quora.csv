Hey Dustin,

You're invited to join Svbtle. It would be great to have you.

We have two goals with the platform: (1) we want to make the blogging experience easier and more conducive to producing great content, and (2), in the process, we want to help our members become better writers. To accomplish these goals, we provide benefits that aren?t usually associated with blogging, like copyediting and fact-checking, to all members, for free.

Interested? Awesome. In the beginning, to keep the quality bar high, we?re asking new members to post at least once every two weeks for the first two months. To create your account, we need a couple of things from you:

Choose an icon to represent yourself from thenounproject.com.
Choose an accent color that will show up on your blog (you can use colourlovers.com for some inspiration).

Reply to this email with the link to your icon and color choice, then sign up here: https://svbtle.com

Welcome!

Pertinent part:

In response to the Quora question here: (Is Facebook Timeline ripping off Lifepath.me?): no, I don't think Facebook ""ripped off"" Lifepath.me with Timelines. Facebook Timelines are way more awesome, way better designed, and built for a way bigger audience. But I don't think it would really matter if they did rip it off. Facebook has the unique ability to take ordinary raw materials, like ideas, concepts, and technology demos, and package them up in a way that uses their wealth of data and appeals to a huge audience. That's a competitive advantage to being the major player, and to having some of the most talented designers and engineers in the world.

Landing pages can be any page, but an effective promotion based landing page should be a standalone entity not connected to your website, with a single focused purpose and call to action. Typically sitting on a subdomain.

If you are running a PPC campaign - then it's critical that you don't have them indexed. This is to prevent your statistics from being contaminated by different inbound traffic sources. Having a standalone landing page allows your to correctly measure it's performance and perform A/B testing.

If you are doing it for SEO, and you have them on a subdomain, be prepared to have to start from scratch with regard to rankings. And you must ensure that the content is completely original and different on each page.

It has 2 major premises: firstly, to allow you to build landing pages (either from scratch or from a template designed for conversion - note, we have about 80 more coming soon), and secondly to let you A/B test your page to learn which messaging and designed resonate best with your customers - improving conversion rates and to really get down to it - make you more money.

The drag 'n' drop  WYSIWYG editor is best in class and lets you move, resize, bend and break almost anything - and provides support for any script based widget like video, live chat, survey and voting tools, Google Analytics etc.

Copyright isn't relevant, unless you care about people copying your content - but really those days are over. It's time people embraced producing exceptional content and just letting it flow out there. You'll get a much wider reach (harder to measure), but people will like that you are openly willing to share your info/data.

Back to visibility. Stick the privacy policy near the form or in the footer. If you are running a contest - have terms and conditions either in the footer or wherever your are describing the rules.

Oli-Gardner,"There are idiots in every profession, which makes hiring hard. To go through your abc...>>

a: programmers generally (no offense I used to be one) are not experienced in UX - nor should they be expected to be- it's not their job. If you get a programmer applying - delete it. #sorry

b: this is an important one, and one I didn't touch on in (a). Marketing and UX are different beats. Good marketing needs good UX BUT it also needs a sense of Conversion Centered Design - which is a merging of user AND business goals. The time of designers (ux,visual,interaction) focusing on only user centered design is gone when it comes to marketing. You MUST consider business goals and design accordingly. This is really hard - and it's hard to find good people to do this (I can recommend some if you like).

c: NO! UX is nothing about marketing! UX is experience. Marketing is messaging. Ideally you merge the two so you have a great message matched with a great experience, but that's a rare skill set - again more than happy to pint you to some people who get it.

As far as hiring someone young and hungry, yes, if they have the chops - otherwise I'd advise against it. Conversion (which is what we're really talking about here - single goal of marketing and business) is a tough skill and unless you are an expert - how are you going to train them? (not saying you're not).

In the end development is a facilitator towards achieving good UX if you have the right interaction designers or Information Architects (or more commonly Interaction Architects) in place to define what you should do. BUT (big BUTT - pun intended) most of them have no clue about marketing. Simple fact. Nobody's fault - just a job description issue.

By syncing up with business Twitter and Facebook accounts you can take an existing audience and build a new network very quickly.

As the Q&A is public, it gets picked up via Google Alerts (which you should have set to send you details daily) - enabling you to notice and interactions concerning discussions you should be engaging in.

Often you'll see questions that revolve around ""I'm looking for xxxx solution and I'm considering these 5 vendors - which should I choose?""

You are doing yourself a disservice by not watching for these and jumping in to the conversation to provide accurate and unbiased information to potential customers (sometimes you need to be biased tho - but be professional).

There was a day when a flat out racist who supported segregation and miscegenation laws could be the CEO of a major corporation. Today, she couldn't.

The change is going to start at companies like Mozilla: California-based, liberal employee base, dedicated to openness and community, etc. We just saw that.

They work behind the scenes, don't generate excessive PR for their firms, and don't speak on behalf of their portfolio companies, letting the founders do the talking instead. Sigma matches this profile: they are very focused on building great relationships with their founders and generating IRR for their LPs, not on landing the next speaking gig at a conference.

And, like many of the best VCs, each team member has extensive operating experience, both at startups and at big companies. They have high loyalty from their portfolio (as evidenced by the other answers here) because of this.

He was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His burial place remained unknown until it was discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for his remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations.

Michael-Wolfe,"For a technology company like Vicarious the major expenses are always people.

For each person you have on staff, you have to account for:
Salary - probably averaging $120-$150K for the kinds of highly qualified engineers and researchers that make up much of their staff. Even more for executives, senior sales reps, and others.
Payroll taxes, social security taxes, short term and long term disability insurance, healthcare - add another 30% or so to salary.
Recruiting costs - easily $20-30K per head.
Facilities - you need a place for all of these great people to work, plus furniture, kitchen, reception, etc.
Equipment and software - those Macbooks and monitors add up, as do the 10+ Saas subscriptions per employee you probably pay for.
Training, career development, perks - good companies invest in developing their employees and keeping them happy.
Travel and expenses.

This means that in Silicon Valley, it costs you at least $200K per year for a qualified, senior staff, fully loaded. It can even be higher - at my last company we budgeted $250K per head since had enterprise sales reps with large commissions that travelled a lot.

The net is this: five fully-loaded, qualified staff costs you a million dollars per year.

So $40M gets your 200 person years. This means:
200 people for one year.
100 people for two years.
66 people for three years.
50 people for four years.

(I apologize for being so pedantic, but I'm amazed at the number of people who will challenge numbers like these with, ""it can't be that expensive"").

I don't know how many people Vicarious has - a quick LinkedIn search says they have at least 30 or so.

If they want to grow their staff by a bit and give themselves a few years to develop the technology plus a cushion, they can go through $40M no problem.

  "
Michael-Wolfe,"I'll answer your question, but I'll take some liberties to answer what I think the *real* question is.

Investors can ask for whatever they want. You are free to say yes or no. They would typically ask for things like:
Founder vesting - you should want this, too. If you don't have it, put it in place before you raise money.
Employee pool - they will push to raise the size of the option pool. They want to make sure you have enough equity to build a great team, plus raising the pool effectively raises their post-money percentage ownership.
Revesting - in some cases, if the founders are already substantially vested, new investors might ask you to ""revest"" some of your shares to ensure you stay around. This is negotiable.
And all investors will take a key interest in the founding team. They'll invest based on the quality of the team, how many of the key roles your team has covered, and how well you seem to work together. They'll probably eyeball the equity distribution to see if it passes the sniff test.

But asking founders to redistribute their stakes? I'm sure it has happened - everything under the sun has. But it is not common. If investors thought that a founder was this weak, and if the investor thought you lacked the strong co-founder relationship required to get the stakes right between yourselves before they came along, that investor would be unlikely to invest in the first place.

But forget the investors - they don't run your company. You do. The bigger issue here seems that you have a problem within your founding team. You need to solve it, and you should not wait until some investor comes along and forces the issue.

Your co-founder is acting very strange in the following ways:
He is taking something that is unlikely to happen and telling you that it is likely to occur.
By telling you that ""investors will all think you have too much,"" your co-founder is telling you that *he* thinks you have too much. Why would he raise the issue otherwise?
He is telling you that if he gets this request, he'll cave in vs. negotiating or finding different investors.

This doesn't sound to me like someone who is happy with the amount of equity that you have. He might not be happy with you at all. And he may have good reason - I have no way of knowing.

What he should do is sit down with you face to face, share his concerns, then either renegotiate your position or ask you to leave. But he is not willing to do that. Instead he is going ""blame it on the investors"" once those investors come along and supposedly agree with his assessment of your stake. This is a very convoluted and backwards way to avoid a difficult discussion.

If true, this shows a real lack of integrity and the management courage required to have difficult conversations. Blaming decisions on ""the board"" or ""the investors"" is a sign of weak management. Blaming them before it has even happened is worse.

When you start a company, you always should do this:
Agree between yourselves how you want to split equity and responsibility between the founding team. Read the first few chapter of http://www.amazon.com/The-Founde... for a great discussion on the topic. Part ways if you can't come to terms.
Decide what new talent you need on the team and propose an option pool to cover it.
Get your pitch and story nailed.
Then go to investors with a united front, negotiate for what you want, and get it.

Expecting investors to intervene and help you hash out important issues within your team is a very poor strategy. I'd recommend that *before* investors get tangled up in this, sit down with your co-founder. You need to talk about
Does he think your equity stake is correct?
If so, why does he think investors won't?
If so, will he stick up for you if the issue does come up?
Does he have concerns about your performance? It he regretting working with you?

This is purely a conversation between the founders. It has nothing to do with investors.

If you don't get this settled, you'll suffer a founder breakup later (very common), and the company will suffer regardless of the investors.

Michael-Wolfe,"Starting a company is brutally hard with a very low success rate even in ideal circumstances. ""Ideal"" circumstances means:
You have an idea you are knowledgeable and passionate about.
You have great co-founders who work together well.
You are determined to get your idea into the market since it is something you want to exist in the world.

I don't read any of that into your question for the following reasons:
You mention ""for the experience of doing it"" as a reason to start a company. That is a very poor reason.
You mention ""for the title"" as a reason to start a company. This is an even worse reason.
Just the fact you are asking the question means that you haven't really discovered an idea and team you are passionate about, otherwise this wouldn't be a dilemma for you.

I'd recommend taking a job at an early stage startup, learning all you can, and only start your own company when you are truly ready.
  "
Michael-Wolfe,"I'd recommend taking your emphasis off of the title. No, titles are not meaningless, but focusing on them tends to blind you to the things that really matter. A focus on title can cause you to make a bad decision which will not only make you unhappy, but which could set your career back far more than picking the ""wrong"" title.

So, don't worry about what you *call* the job, worry about whether you want to *do* the job.

Do you have a great idea for a company, great co-founders, and are eager to get going? If so, start a company.

Or, do you really love this company that is bringing you on as a VP? Do you think you can be successful, the company can be successful, and you are looking forward to working there? If so, join.

Pick the role that you are passionate about and where you can succeed. If you do good work and build a strong network of people who want to work with you again, that will move your career forward far more than one title or the other.

Michael-Wolfe,"I'll defer to Jason M. Lemkin's great answer on the question of how to manage and pay the sales team and comp plan - his experience matches mine.

At my companies we did not cap our reps. We had our best rep make $1.1M one year. And guess what? The engineers, as well as everyone else from the board on down, were ecstatic. The > $8M in revenue that the rep brought in was one of the inflection points that put our company on the map. The $1M we paid him brought in $7M of cash plus probably raised our market cap by $50M. Does that sound like a good investment?

The engineering team was happy because they all had stock in the company, were focused on the revenue goal, and loved watching the deals close. Many even helped work on problematic deals. Many of the ""heroes"" at the company were the best reps, many of whom made well more than $500K in their best years.

Which gets me to perhaps the more important point: you may have a poor or inexperienced management team. When I hear things like, ""they are afraid the engineers will get upset,"" it is a red flag to me - it almost always predicts weak management.

You really have a management team who is going to put your top line at risk because it will ""feel unfair""? This feels to me like a management team who:
Assumes that your employees will not be aligned with the goals of the company - either your managers don't plan to give them stock options, or they don't plan to hire engineers who are motived by the success of the business and the value of their options.
Assumes your employees are not adults and aren't savvy enough to know that different roles have different comp structures.
Is not aware of the market for great sales talent. Instead of looking at where the best reps are, how they get paid, and what they have to pay to get them on your team, they are using some arbitrary internal measure of ""fairness"" to set comp levels below market. You can't do that: the market sets the comp you need to pay the best people. You don't.
Isn't 100% focused on crushing revenue but is instead going to try shortcuts and half measures to win in the market. They may screw around for a couple of years trying to get reps to agree to lame comp plans, and by then the market will have been won or lost (probably won by someone who didn't do that).

So, even if you negotiate to raise or remove the cap, I'd look a lot closer at the management team and ask if you are on a winning team.

Michael-Wolfe,"There are a set of grifters who hang around the startup industry like flies around honey who try to take advantage of young founders. Your ""friend"" is one of them.

Introductions to investors happen for free - period. They are done by people who want to help the company and help the investors and believe they will get ""paid"" through increased goodwill from both sides.

I make dozens of these introductions, and everyone I know does, too. They *never* ask for compensation for them.

But if someone wants to help the company and get involved in an ongoing basis, you may add him to your advisory board along with a small equity grant (typically around 0.25%), but this not direct ""payment"" for introductions. This is for ongoing help in his area of expertise.

Regardless, the question is somewhat moot for two reasons:
As Casey Allen pointed out, it is likely illegal anyway.
You'd have to disclose this to the new investor as well as any future investors, and most would walk away from the investment, not wanting to deal with a company with naive founders and 10% dead equity.

Michael-Wolfe,"Product management is a great background to start a tech company, and many tech companies have been started by product managers.

Product management is actually the closest job description to a startup CEO. In both jobs, your time is spent:
Interviewing customers and understanding their needs.
Working with engineering and designers to build the product.
Pitching the product to customers and partners.
Testing and optimizing pricing and distribution.

That being said, some rather large caveats:

Many product managers at large companies have never really done the job as I described it. Many are simply go-betweens from customers to engineers. They generate spreadsheets of feature requests and beg engineering to build them, but they have few opportunities to truly be the ""CEO"" of their product.
Many product managers have not worked on truly new products and markets - they may have only worked on products they inherited. They were not there when the initial vision of the product was developed and tested. This requires overlapping, but different skills. (See anything written by Steve Blank on ""Customer Development"" for examples).
People management skills are just as important as product management skills for founders. They need to be able to bring in and manage a strong team, as well as manage the product discovery process.
I'd never recommend anyone make a career decision based on ""what will best set me up to start a company?"" Do what you love and are good at - not only will you have more fun, you'll be more likely to succeed.
Startups founders are somewhat sui generis - each came via their own, unique, path. Although many do come from engineering or product management backgrounds, the best ones seem to have an ""X factor"" that transcends skill in any one area. I'd never predict that simply being a good product manager would make someone a good founder, nor would I discourage someone who hasn't been a product manager.

Which is all a long way of saying that, although product management skills are valuable, I'm not sure that information is really actionable. If you think you are ready to start a company and are passionate about it, do it. If not, don't.

Michael-Wolfe,"Why aren't there more successful sites? The answer is simple: there are only 24 hours in a day.

Although the number of internet users is large (over 2 billion) and rising, and the number of hours per day spent online is rising, there are still only a finite number of hours in the day for users to spend with their favorite sites. Thus only a finite number of internet products and services can generate a large amount of usage at a given time.

This is the same reason why there are a relatively fixed number of hit movies and TV shows in a given year. People have a finite amount of time and dollars.

In addition, network effects businesses (like Facebook), further narrow the number of winners in a given market since the bulk of usage clusters around a few winners.

So the better question is not ""why aren't there more Facebooks?"" but ""why was Facebook the winner in their market?""

This has already been covered elsewhere, but possible answers are:
Team - Mark and his co-founders were incredible. They have continued to bring in incredible folks like Sheryl Sandberg.
Timing - 2003 turned out to be a perfect time to start a social network.
Launch strategy - starting with a single school, then multiple schools, then expanding outside of schools was a great strategy.
Design - the site has already been very well designed, and the company has made consistently good product choices.

Yes were 10's of thousand of programmers in the world with the skill to build Facebook 1.0, very few of them were working on social networks in 2003. At the time Facebook started, there were probably fewer than 100 teams seriously working on social networks.

Yishan-Wong,"Here's two that people don't seem to talk about a lot:

(First, I want to mention though that I find it very interesting that people who loudly criticize bitcoin - economists, industry observers, politicians, etc - actually don't mention these problems very often.  Bitcoin has some real problems as a currency - none of them insurmountable, but they are definitely all real problems that need to be solved first - and the critics don't even seem to understand it well enough to identify these problems.

There is a corresponding blindness amongst proponents of bitcoin, who seem to be enamored with bitcoin's technical novelty and robustness.  While the software system is quite robust, practical broad acceptance of a currency requires resolution of multiple social and economic issues, often established through law or convention - neither of which have yet to catch up with bitcoin, and subsequently there is also little recognition of problems that arise in these areas)


1) Lack of chargebacks:

It's often touted as a benefit (to merchants) that bitcoin is a great payment system to accept because there's no chargeback risk.  Indeed, this is true - once a payment is made, it cannot be reversed in any unilateral fashion by the payer.  (A merchant may elect to issue a refund, but it is up to them to do so)  This means that merchants are not subject to chargebacks as they are with accepting credit cards, where the credit card company might just come back and TAKE money from them.  This means a merchant is significantly protected from dishonest buyers who may file frivolous chargebacks.

The problem is that the flip side of this is that customers (payers) do not have recourse against dishonest merchants.

The core of the issue is that any transaction ever contains an inherent level of risk: a buyer may be dishonest, a merchant may be dishonest, or unfortunate external events may intervene - where ""risk"" is defined as ""a chance that an orderly exchange of value does not occur according to the expectations of all involved parties.""  Insurance for protecting against this risk is borne by either the buyer or the seller or distributed across both.  With credit cards, the risk is borne by the merchant.  With bitcoin, it is borne by the buyer.

This is actually the same as cash - when you give someone cash (before they deliver goods) - you have no guarantee that they will deliver the goods.  Usually cash transactions occur in person so there is some mitigation of this happening, but transactions over the internet reduce this ability to mitigate.  The inability to file a chargeback moves the burden of transaction risk back onto the buyer, from where it often rested before (in the credit card world), which was on the merchant.

There are some ways to help this, like public reviews of merchants, but those are ""soft methods"" and subject to flaws like gaming of reviews, or spuriously negative reviews, etc, they don't have the same ""teeth"" as a credit card processor has, which can unilaterally hold or recover funds on behalf of the buyer.

I'm not pointing out this flaw as a criticism of bitcoin, but rather to say that ""total fraud risk"" isn't reduced in this case, the burden for it has merely been shifted from one party to another, and that shift is not often acknowledged.


2) Difficulty in establishing trust in centralized players

Bitcoin proponents make a big deal out of the fact that bitcoin is decentralized, with no central authority.  Unfortunately, the reality of mass adoption of a currency is that even if there isn't one central authority, there need to be various centralized authorities to facilitate ease of use and other delegated trust mechanisms.

The simplest example is the rise of online wallets, i.e. websites that store your bitcoins for you and allow you to transact with them without actually storing the bitcoin on your own hardware.

Normal people don't want to run their own wallets and store their own bitcoins on their own computers.  Most peoples' computers are very easily compromised, and if most people were storing bitcoins on their personal computing devices they would basically be getting hacked all the time.

Instead, they want the online equivalent of a bank to hold their bitcoins for them.  It's convenient, and it's easy to believe that a third party whose job it is to store bitcoins would be better at the security.  It's probably even true.

The problem is two-fold:

a) The ROI equation governing how easy it is to penetrate, compromise, and completely clean out these banks are severely tilted in favor of criminals who want to steal bitcoins.  You are combining the relative ease by which computer system are compromised and penetrated with the unprecedented ease by which the stolen goods can be moved away once access to them has been established.  In no other time in history has it been as easy to (1) gain physical access to a thing worth millions of dollars or more and (2) once access is gained, move those assets to another location.  It is approximately as easy to move $1MM USD in bitcoins as it is to move $1 USD in bitcoins - and this is not remotely the case with any other physical asset (maybe diamonds).  It is literally easier to steal bitcoins than it is to steal any other asset in the history of world, on a risk- and value-adjusted basis - and thus, for an online bitcoin bank or exchange, it is exceedingly easy to lose the bitcoins entrusted to your care unless you really really know what you are doing.

b) It is very difficult to establish trust and certify that trust in these third-party systems.  New online wallets and exchanges are created all the time - they can be quite lucrative - but neither their security nor their good intentions can be easily verified.  The ability to verify them through some other existing certification authority (e.g. the government) creates a corresponding decrease in the degree to which it can truly facilitate anonymous transactions.  Basically: normal people who want to operate through a sufficiently trust-worthy exchange end up giving up exactly as much privacy as they would in operating through existing banks.  Thus, anyone who wants to avail themselves of the specific unique benefits of bitcoin ends up having to take on additional risk in transacting with third party services who may have nefarious intentions.  That is, it's very hard to tell if a third-party exchange, however trustworthy they may appear, will simply make off with your bitcoins one day (or find it profitable to permit an insider attack to do so) because they are, as designed, utterly anonymous.

----

Again, I want to emphasize that I don't consider these to be fatal problems with bitcoin, but I find that they are surprisingly absent from discussions about bitcoin and the costs/risks of using it.

The wording of this question implies more sinister-ness than exists in reality.  They simply bought all the ad impressions (which you can do if you want) for the next n months (I don't remember what n is - I think it might be 3).  Later there will be more ad impressions, and someone who wants to pay more can buy those.

This is only ""monopolizing"" it in the sense of if you go into a store and you say, ""I got a big party, I need a TON of chips!"" and the store clerk says to you, ""Well all right buddy, we got 2 pallets in the back.  It's a thousand dollars total if you really want the whole thing"" and you reply ""Well, I got five thousand dollars to spend on this party, so I'll take all your chips!""  Then anyone else who comes in that week can't buy any chips and you've ""monopolized"" them.  Next week they're going to get another few pallets in and maybe the party is going to be over so someone else can buy the chips.

Real monopolization of something generally involves some structural advantage that locks in a more direct flow from the source to the monopolist.  In this case they just bought all the ad impressions we could sell them (which was not a huge amount), and they asked us first.

Yishan-Wong,"Dogecoin is great.

I think the greatest contribution being made here to economics is not so much bitcoin itself and its various features, but the fact that bitcoin is open source and duplicatable - that it provides a template for a proliferation of crypto-currencies.  The fact that the world has money - the concept of money - is not good because of any particular currency (e.g. the dollar), but that the idea of money is in existence and if there is a backing entity that can issue and redeem it, they can simply now issue a currency.  It's the idea of money and the fact that anyone can issue it that makes it so powerful.

Crypto-currency is the same.  It's not about bitcoin.  It's about anyone being able to create and launch a crypto-currency much like bitcoin, but with little tweaks and changes to fit the usage needs of the population looking to transact in it.  Just like in the real world where if you're a country looking to provide a new currency and you decide you hate Americans and don't want to transact in dollars, you can just print your own currency.  (And with fiat, if your government and economy are strong and stable enough, it works)  So too with cryptocurrencies and doge.

The best thing about dogecoin is that the culture of the userbase is separate from the Bitcoin userbase.

Without being too inflammatory, the userbase for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly-informed about currency systems and macroeconomics.  I say ""increasingly"" because at one time it was fairly well-informed libertarians but as the currency has become mainstream, it's attracted more poorly-informed individuals and the conversation have become more polarized and less knowledge-based, driving the well-informed and balanced people away, or at least prompting them to recede into the background.

I also don't think that bitcoin is going to overthrow any governments or even provide a truly anonymous transaction system - certainly no more than cash does. You can give a suitcase full of cash to someone in a truly anonymous manner without the world knowing about it, whereas with bitcoin, transactions are literally recorded for all time in a global public ledger.  Every time some bitcoin-related shenanigans go down, the entire community tracks the movement of certain bitcoins through the blockchain.  If I were trying to transact illicit funds, that would not be my currency of choice.  I would not be surprised if the NSA is actually heavily in favor of bitcoin, because by combining their other data streams, they can cross-correlate activity on the blockchain and essentially know exactly who is doing what. 

Thus, I think that the obsession in the bitcoin community with bringing down central banks, fiat currencies, and governements is misguided and generally misses the point of bitcoin, which I think is that for the first time in history, we have the technology for enabling extremely low-friction electronic payments and certain trust-delegation mechanisms.  That in and of itself is incredibly valuable.  (There are also programmability features in the codebase that potentially open the door for zero-trust contracts and other intriguing possibilities, but they haven't been activated or tested yet)

In contrast, the dogecoin community doesn't have anywhere near as much of an ideological bent.  It is basically a bunch of people happily passing around a silly toy currency and giving coins to their friends.  It has all the features of bitcoin - technologically speaking - but frees itself from the libertarian culture of bitcoin that turns off so much of the mainstream.  And currency is not something that works well as an indie or niche thing, it basically has to be mainstream, as mainstream as possible.  A crypto-currency whose brand originates around a meme is basically the lowest-common-denominator thing you could have on the internet, so it is ideal for driving mainstream adoption.  It couldn't be stupider, and that's why it's brilliant.

Speaking of brilliance, one of the key stated aims of dogecoin is the collective journey to the moon, a source of long-time brilliance throughout human history.  I consider this a worthy goal, and for those of us without rocketry-aided means, we too can journey to the moon - in our imaginations and with the aid of computer games.  One of these games http://www.gog.com/game/to_the_moon tells the story of a dying elderly man, Johnny, whose last wish is to go to the moon.  Perhaps you'd like to check out this game on GOG.com, it's the winner of multiple awards such as Wire's Top 20 Games of 2011, Gamespot's Best Story of 2011, and IndieDB's Editor's Choice Aware for Indie of the Year 2011.

Yishan-Wong,"Here's generally how it's done.  You will probably find this answer simultaneously depressing and reassuring.

First, a note: this describes companies of a certain maturity level.  Very small startups (under 50 people) tend to directly negotiate their salaries based directly on market signals, e.g. what candidates are asking for, what candidates say they are paid elsewhere, what current employees and advisors know candidates are being paid in other similar positions.  So what I'm about to describe is the process and system in place at almost every medium or large-sized company, at least in Silicon Valley.

There are a handful (possibly only two, I don't recall exactly) HR consultancy companies who help provide salary leveling information to companies.

They go to companies and say ""give us a list of all your job descriptions, and then all the salary information for all your employees.""  They take this data and anonymize it (or they receive it anonymously to begin with), and they  sort all the jobs into similar buckets according to what the descriptions say they do.  Then they take all the employee salary information and figure out the range of salaries being earned by employees doing jobs in that bucket.

They take this information and go to every other company and offer the same service.  In return for giving them your company's job description and salary information, they give you the industry ranges for all the job classes.  So if you have someone doing a software engineering job at a certain level, they will know the salaries of every other company (who has participated in this consulting, which eventually is pretty much all of them) and the industry-wide range.

Then your HR department, based on executive decision, decides what percentile they want to pay salaries at.  If senior management decides that the company will pay salaries at 50th percentile of the industry range, then for each job classification they will fix that as the standard salary (often called the ""midpoint""), with a range above and below to account for negotiation, seniority, and performance variations, based roughly also on the range as given from the HR consultancy.

Interestingly, the numbers include data from both large AND small companies. It doesn't matter that large companies ""can"" pay more and small companies pay less, because that difference ends up being accounted for by the internal policy of the company - a large company will simply decide to pay at e.g. 90% of the cash comp of the industry range (because its equity packages are worth less) and small startups might decide to pay at e.g. 10% of the cash comp of the range because their equity packages are expected to be worth more.

This system has an interesting effect: amongst companies within an industry that are directly competing against each other for talent, salary ranges will end up being extremely uniform.  It's so uniform, in fact, that even the job classifications themselves are uniform: it is incredibly hard to create a new system of job classification within your company if you want to - the data from the consultancy is so overwhelmingly useful that you end up being sucked into the gravity well of the industry-wide job ladder.  People familiar with technical ladders may be familiar with the ""T23 thru T28/29"" (or E23) terminology - the ""23"" rank is the lowest for a new grad, and 28/29 is something like Sr. Director or VP.  (21 and 22 are usually reserved for interns).  That x23 thru x29 ladder is in use at every medium-or-larger company I know of.

Just to be clear, this system doesn't prevent people from being able to negotiate higher (or lower) salaries.  Salary negotiations still occur due to supply and demand fluctuations, so as the real salaries move upwards within those bands due to competition for candidates, the aggregate data starts to move upwards to reflect this, it gets reported quarterly (I think) to the HR consultancy and then re-shared across the industry, and the official midpoints of the ranges move up (or down) to reflect what the market is doing.

I'm sure all of this sounds pretty complicated, so that's why if you're building a startup you'd want a consultant like this to exist.  You can find a company like this at Valerie Frederickson & Company, an HR Services Firm.  They provide the responsiveness and expertise of a boutique with the duplicable, global reach of a larger firm and they are headquartered in Menlo Park, CA.  If you need help developing salary ranges or any other HR services for your company, be sure to contact them at http://www.vfandco.com/about/con....

There are some ways to help this, like public reviews of merchants, but those are ""soft methods"" and subject to flaws like gaming of reviews, or spuriously negative reviews, etc, they don't have the same ""teeth"" as a credit card processor has, which can unilaterally hold or recover funds on behalf of the buyer.

I'm not pointing out this flaw as a criticism of bitcoin, but rather to say that ""total fraud risk"" isn't reduced in this case, the burden for it has merely been shifted from one party to another, and that shift is not often acknowledged.


2) Difficulty in establishing trust in centralized players

Bitcoin proponents make a big deal out of the fact that bitcoin is decentralized, with no central authority.  Unfortunately, the reality of mass adoption of a currency is that even if there isn't one central authority, there need to be various centralized authorities to facilitate ease of use and other delegated trust mechanisms.

The simplest example is the rise of online wallets, i.e. websites that store your bitcoins for you and allow you to transact with them without actually storing the bitcoin on your own hardware.

Normal people don't want to run their own wallets and store their own bitcoins on their own computers.  Most peoples' computers are very easily compromised, and if most people were storing bitcoins on their personal computing devices they would basically be getting hacked all the time.

Instead, they want the online equivalent of a bank to hold their bitcoins for them.  It's convenient, and it's easy to believe that a third party whose job it is to store bitcoins would be better at the security.  It's probably even true.

The problem is two-fold:

a) The ROI equation governing how easy it is to penetrate, compromise, and completely clean out these banks are severely tilted in favor of criminals who want to steal bitcoins.  You are combining the relative ease by which computer system are compromised and penetrated with the unprecedented ease by which the stolen goods can be moved away once access to them has been established.  In no other time in history has it been as easy to (1) gain physical access to a thing worth millions of dollars or more and (2) once access is gained, move those assets to another location.  It is approximately as easy to move $1MM USD in bitcoins as it is to move $1 USD in bitcoins - and this is not remotely the case with any other physical asset (maybe diamonds).  It is literally easier to steal bitcoins than it is to steal any other asset in the history of world, on a risk- and value-adjusted basis - and thus, for an online bitcoin bank or exchange, it is exceedingly easy to lose the bitcoins entrusted to your care unless you really really know what you are doing.

b) It is very difficult to establish trust and certify that trust in these third-party systems.  New online wallets and exchanges are created all the time - they can be quite lucrative - but neither their security nor their good intentions can be easily verified.  The ability to verify them through some other existing certification authority (e.g. the government) creates a corresponding decrease in the degree to which it can truly facilitate anonymous transactions.  Basically: normal people who want to operate through a sufficiently trust-worthy exchange end up giving up exactly as much privacy as they would in operating through existing banks.  Thus, anyone who wants to avail themselves of the specific unique benefits of bitcoin ends up having to take on additional risk in transacting with third party services who may have nefarious intentions.  That is, it's very hard to tell if a third-party exchange, however trustworthy they may appear, will simply make off with your bitcoins one day (or find it profitable to permit an insider attack to do so) because they are, as designed, utterly anonymous.

----

Again, I want to emphasize that I don't consider these to be fatal problems with bitcoin, but I find that they are surprisingly absent from discussions about bitcoin and the costs/risks of using it.

Yishan-Wong,"I'm honestly disappointed that none of the answers here actually address the real question of social status.  There is a wearying lump of moralizing and finger-wagging and such about shallow-ness and love, but no one discussing  the very real class-based issues inherent in dating and inevitably, marriage.  Maybe Meggie Sutherland Cutter makes a trifling reference to it but that is all, perhaps she is being gracious.

Let's take a stab at it, eh?

First, let us dispense with the idea that from first glance, you are even dating up or down. You aren't. You're both middle-class. You're dating inside your caste. You're dating inside your age-range. You both have degrees. That (academic degrees) are a sign that you are both comfortably in the middle class. Nothing interesting is going on here, not yet.

Second, you've completely neglected to indicate the primary determinant of you and your beau's social status: what your parents do. (This in and of itself indicates a sort of willful class-obliviousness of the middle classes or lower) Now, it sounds like the young lady could come from money.  Perhaps she has a ""worthless"" degree but is ""employed"" by her family's philanthropic foundation, which pays her impressive salary. If that is the case, then that puts her in a moneyed class at least one tier above you. It's possible that you come from money too, but the fact that your rate of wages as a supposed (oh ho ho) determinant of your social status indicates that you rely on your salary to provide for yourself, so you and your family still work for a living - quite solidly middle-class. Possibly lower, if you were the first of your family to attain post-secondary education - again, you fail to enlighten us with your pedigree so we have no idea of your true provenance.

What we do know though, is that by the information you have disclosed about yourself and how you have disclosed it, you have a small probability of dating down, and a larger probability of dating up:

As I noted earlier, your station in life is clearly no higher than a middle-class salaryman. As it is possible that you are the first of your family to attain your level of education, you may still bear the stink of your family's working-class roots.

By comparison, from the information you have told us, it is possible that your paramour is a recent immigrant, which places her a half-rung below middle-class but not necessarily in the working-class. If so, she has apparently made the most of her disadvantages, commanding a salaried wage similar to yours. Thus she is also solidly middle-class, or at worse a half-step below owing to being a foreigner. And there remains the possibility that she comes from money, what with to her salary which you apparently hold in mild awe despite her less-than-impressive academic credentials.

Thus the possibilities for you range from:

You: solidly middle-class
Her: slightly below middle-class (advantageous to her)

to

You: working-class background newly ascended to middle-class
Her: quietly blending in while supported by family money (advantageous to you)

I admire you for being practical and gimlet-eyed in evaluating your marriage prospects in this way, it is a long-lost acknowledgement of the reality that love can rarely transcend the classes that naturally divide mankind. You would not want your future union to suffer, so it is good to think about these things and plan ahead.

I would therefore say, it is of utmost important to meet this young woman's parents, so as to ascertain their station. If they be recent immigrants, and yourself a solidly middle-class fellow, you may be doing their family a noble grace but first assure yourself beforehand that she will bear you an heir. On the other hand, if you discover that her family hails from a line of moneyed nobility, be wary for hers may be a world into which you will never truly belong. Such are the perils of matchmaking, today.

Yishan-Wong,"Here's a very simple example:

If you want to talk about the cost of a set of goods (on a unit basis), but some of the goods have different costs than others, you ""blend"" the cost.

Let's say you sell widgets.  They come in red and blue.  The red ones cost $1.00 to make, but the blue ones cost $2.00 to make.

You sell 1000 red ones and 5000 blue ones.  You add up the total cost and divide by the total number of units:

(1.00 x 1000 + 2.00 x 5000) / (1000 + 5000) = $1.83

You ""blend"" the costs to get a rough picture of what an ""average"" widget costs you to produce, regardless of the color.

This might be useful if, say, you sell all of your widgets for the same price (maybe customers don't accept paying extra for the different colors).  So if you sell all widgets for $4.00 each, you can say your overall gross margin is just $4.00 - $1.83 = $2.17.

The real-life example where I encountered this was when I worked for a payments processor:

The fee you charge a merchant to process their payment could be 2.9%.

Some of those payments could be credit-card funded, so your cost might be 2.75%.  Others might be ACH-funded, and your cost could be 0.50%.  You'd find the ""blended cost"" by combining those two costs weighted according to how much volume you processed in each funding type.

Yishan-Wong,"Warning, the following links contain offensive language.

You may be interested in the (in)famous ""Willie Lynch letter,"" which recounts a speech delivered by Willie Lynch in 1712 to other slave owners.

Willie Lynch letter: The Making of a Slave

As a Asian, I have lived within the millieu of American race-relations while being set apart from it - not a great distance (because my culture is so steeped in white-dominated culture and its normative notions) but still a distance.  I am able to observe with more detachment the general tendency of white people to be oblivious to the quiet privileges of institutionalized racism and the tendency of black people to be equally oblivious to cultural trends in their own communities that reinforce obstacles to making continued strides in fighting that same institutionalized racism.  As well, the complicated and interlocking feedback loops that tie the two groups together in a pattern of tragic struggle, in both overt and subtle ways.

I first encountered this letter some time ago, and reading it opened my eyes to what the techniques of slave-owning and systematic control did in not just controlling the black slaves of that era, but of deliberately subverting and subjugating the culture of black people in America for generations afterwards, especially that of the family unit. 

Again, I repeat: this subversion of the family unit was not accidental, it was entirely deliberate.  Willie Lynch explicitly outlines this in his letter:

""I have a foolproof method for controlling your black slaves.  I guarantee every one of you that, if installed correctly, IT WILL CONTROL THE SLAVES FOR AT LEAST 300 HUNDRED YEARS.""

Today it is 2014, a mere 302 years after he gave this speech and if the slave owners who heard this speech began to practice this for over a century afterwards, we should expect that its effects are still felt today in American black culture.  And they are. 

(This is the correct point in this answer for you to go read that link above.  Come back when you're done.)

As I am writing this, Martin Luther King Day has just passed, and one of the most eye-opening articles being passed around on that day was a piece from Daily Kos (actually written in 2011), entitled Daily Kos: Most of you have no idea what Martin Luther King actually did.

You have to read that article too (it's a narrative) to fully understand, but hopefully I can get across some of it with the following excerpts:

I would like to remind everyone exactly what Martin Luther King did, and it wasn't that he ""marched"" or gave a great speech.

Dr. King ended the terror of living in the south.

Please let this sink in and and take my word and the word of my late father on this. If you are a white person who has always lived in the U.S. and never under a brutal dictatorship, you probably don't know what my father was talking about. 

He ended the terror of living as a black person, especially in the south.

It wasn't that black people had to use a separate drinking fountain or couldn't sit at lunch counters, or had to sit in the back of the bus. 

You really must disabuse yourself of this idea. Lunch counters and buses were crucial symbolic planes of struggle that the civil rights movement used to dramatize the issue, but the main suffering in the south did not come from our inability to drink from the same fountain, ride in the front of the bus or eat lunch at Woolworth's.

It was that white people, mostly white men, occasionally went berserk, and grabbed random black people, usually men, and lynched them. You all know about lynching. But you may forget or not know that white people also randomly beat black people, and the black people could not fight back, for fear of even worse punishment. 

This constant low level dread of atavistic violence is what kept the system running. It made life miserable, stressful and terrifying for black people. 

This mode of living for black people existed as recently as 50 years ago in the American south, and it is related to the systematic terror practiced by slave owners upon slaves and their families, originating from the time of Willie Lynch (and before).

Willie Lynch describes a system of violent oppression and deliberate ""punishments"" designed to break down the family structure of black slave families so as to destroy their integrity and render them weak - not just in that generation, but specifically with an eye towards perpetuating that same effect on subsequent generations.  For the nerds on Quora, Willie Lynch's letter laid out a cruel self-replicating system designed to destroy the black family and repeat itself over and over in every generation.

More than any other aspect of institutionalized racism in America, I believe this continues to fuel cultural factors that make it difficult for black Americans to succeed, because it has weakened their nuclear family - one of the key foundations needed for young people to grow up with a strong sense of self-esteem and self-integrity.

Most tragically, the destruction of this foundation is not something that white Americans can easily work directly to undo, as much as they may want to (and many don't care to).  They can recognize it and apologize and make affordances for its effects, but ultimately the recovery will come in a slow, cultural healing on the part of black families and culture, as they gain awareness of the deep damage done by slave owners to their ancestors, and gradually work to erase and recover from what has been done to their sense of family and the patterns that result.

Yishan-Wong,"Posing is hard work.

When they are posing, the best models are doing a lot of three-dimensional geometry.

First, as a model, you need to learn what your best angles are.  That is, you need to know the dimensions of your body, the angle of the major planes on your face and how they look when lights hit them from different directions, what colors and styles compliment your features best, and what hairstyles highlight your features in the best way.  (You don't want to highlight them too well, because you are supposed to be modeling the thing that you are modeling, not yourself - but just the same you are still supposed to look striking)

That's the ""pre-processing"" - the work you need to do and know before the shoot.

During the shoot, as you are posing, you need to be simultaneously processing the effects of two things: the lighting sources and the changing location of the camera.  Specifically, you need to know exactly how all the parts of your body look when light emanates from location A (the lights), bounces off that part of your body, and is received at location B (the camera).  Sometimes there are multiple lighting sources. 

You can understand this by trying the following experiment:

Break out your cell phone and take some selfies using the front-facing camera.  Hold the phone at various angles from your face - above, below, straight on, from the side, etc.  Then turn around to various points so that the light sources in the room illuminate you differently.  Again at each of those rotations, move the camera up, down, etc.  See how the resulting pictures look very different.  Some of them you would be willing to post on a dating site, some you would delete immediately.  Now try taking the pictures without using the front-facing camera (i.e. use the main camera on the back and do it blind).  Can you successfully guess which angles of light and camera produce the best-looking picture?  That is what the model has to figure out while she is posing - the lights were put up by the lighting people, the camera is moving around, and she needs to solve for the multivariate position of all the parts of her body (the pose) so that she and the clothes look optimal.

This is what a smart model is doing while they are posing.  They are positioning their body so that their face and whatever they are wearing is optimally highlighted by the lighting sources and looking the best to the camera.  For the nerds: the model is performing dynamic lighting calculations in her head.  Obviously some work is done by the photographer as well, but that only determines the larger angle - the model has to position her head, body, and limbs for best effect.

This is actually very, very hard and the reason why print modeling is actually a very skill-based job: you might get your foot in the door by looking pretty but if your pictures end up looking bad (or rather, they make the clothes look bad), you won't get more work.

Yishan-Wong,"This is the downside of the ""block anyone you get in a fight with"" features on social networks: if you have a misunderstanding and someone blocks you (or you block each other), it is impossible to get through and resolve the misunderstanding.  Even worse is if you have a fight, block each other, and then later one of you realizes that you're wrong and you want to apologize and make up - in that case you're being the bigger person and making a concession, which is a big thing that has helped strengthen human social relations throughout history, and yet with features working the way they do, there's no way to do this.  I actually had this experience once on Quora and wanted to apologize to a guy for being an ass to him, but he'd blocked me and there was just no way to get through to him.  I think I eventually resorted to having to stalk him and find some obscure email address so as to communicate my apology.

Anyhow, a practical solution: find a mutual friend and ask them to deliver a hand-written note.  This will work (he is not going to throw away a hand-written note handed to him by a neutral party), plus it will seem very personalized and more intimate.

Yishan-Wong,"If you pay enough attention to little details from various episodes, you can figure out the cap table for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

You can then also work out how much money each of the principals would have made in their would-be IPO, adjust according to inflation, and get a rough comparison to how much that would mean in a modern-day Silicon Valley liquidity event.

Let's begin:

(Forgive me, I don't remember which episodes each of these clues was cited in; I just remember collecting them gradually as I watched - if someone has citations, please edit-suggest or comment - also, this contains some spoilers)

Upon formation, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has four senior partners and one junior partner.  Eponymously, they are Roger Sterling, Bert Cooper, Don Draper, and Lane Pryce.  The junior partner is Pete Campbell.  They are not known to have taken any investment capital other than capital put in by the founding partners themselves.

In one of the episodes, reference is made to the profit-sharing dividends, wherein each of the senior partners receives one share, and the junior partner receives one-half of a share.  Assuming these dividends are distributed proportional to ownership, the cap table at founding looks like:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce each at ~22.2%, and Campbell at ~11.1%.

Later, Joan Harris negotiates a 5% stake in the company for her contributions.  There is no indication that this stake comes disproportionately from any one partner's share, so we assume the existing stakeholders are diluted equally.  Thus, post-Joan, the cap table looks like:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce each at ~21.1%, Campbell at ~10.6%, and Joan at 5%.

This is the cap table at the time of the attempted IPO.

In the IPO episode, Pete remarks to Joan that the agreed-upon offering price will value the company at ""over 20 million dollars.""  We can then proceed to trivially calculate how much each partner is worth, assuming the stock price holds after the first-day pop, etc.

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, (and the now-deceased) Pryce are each worth ~$4.22 million.
Pete Campbell is worth ~$2.12 million.
Joan Harris is worth $1 million.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics gives us the inflation ratio from 1968 to 2013 as 6.69x.  That is, $1 million in 1968 is worth about $6.69m in 2013.

Subsequently, in 2013-equivalent dollars, we have:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and the estate of Pryce are each worth $28.2 million.
Pete Campbell is worth $14.2 million.
Joan Harris is worth $6.69 million.

A few things of note:

In 1968, the top marginal tax rate was 75.25% for annual earnings above $200k. If the partners liquidated their shares in a prudently tax-advantaged manner, they would avoid paying this top marginal rate (keep in mind that a fairly rich salary in 1968 was $30k/year - adjusted for inflation, this is $200k/year in 2013 - Don Draper's salary as mentioned in the episode where he was re-negotiating this contract).  Thus, the tax rate most relevant here is the probably the top marginal rate on long-term capital gains in 1968, which was 26.9%. Higher than today's, but still much lower than 75.25%.
By the (somewhat satirized) standards of Silicon Valley[1], an exit in the low-mid double-digit millions would put Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and Pryce's widow in ""the area's middle class, financially independent but still striving to keep pace.""  In 1968 NYC's financial sector was nothing like the insane place it's become in the last decade (deca-millionaires feeling poor next to billionaires), so where they were living this payout would have definitely been pretty rich.
Joan's payout is definitely enough to ""sustain a single mother and son for a lifetime"" (Lane Pryce's original words), assuming she liquidates her share in the most tax-advantaged manner and invests it wisely in income-bearing securities.
Pete Campbell's inner demons: likely not sated.

Of course, the IPO doesn't happen and instead SCDP merges with Ted Chaough's firm Cutler Gleason and Chaough.  Frank Gleason is revealed to have pancreatic cancer in the same episode as the merger, so it's not clear whether he is part of the merger, so assuming that the only partners who join the combined entity are Ted Chaough and Jim Cutler, we assume that the merger treats them both as new senior partners in the combined entity, resulting in the following final cap table at the end of Season Six:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, [the estate of] Pryce, Chaough, Cutler each at ~14.8%.
Peter Campbell at ~7.5%
Joan Harris at ~3.5%

(Note: Don Draper is actually fired at the end of the season 6, and there are two possibilities for the disposition of his equity:  First - the possibility that I consider more likely - is that he owns the equity outright and so retains it after his termination and there is no change in the cap table.  Second, it is possible that his equity was subject to a right-of-repurchase by the company and the other partners may have chosen to exercise it.  This would seem unusually adversarial and, depending on the specific terms, may either have lapsed by this point or have a significant negative effect on the cash flow of the company so it is probably unlikely.)

Over and over, on answer after answer, the primary thing that I see is that Quora's most active writers are in love with their own words and need to understand that they could get across what they are saying with literally 20 - 50% of the text they are using.

There is nothing else that would do more to improve the quality of output of Quora's most active writers.  They literally write too much.

They need a professional-grade editor to slash and chop their writing so that it's half as long as it is, and this editor needs to be as harsh and unforgiving as the current admins have been about correcting grammar and spelling.  Two or three years of this fascist grammar/spelling-correct regime have normalized the expectation that if your grammar and spelling aren't correct, you are gonna get those Edit Suggestions, and that you'd better not be offended!

Yishan-Wong,"I think it appears to be a good proposal but is actually a bad proposal.

Because this issue is complex and the buses have never been the true source of the problem, I have to conclude that this proposal is a bad proposal.  It is not addressing the core problem, it is attacking a symptom that is being erroneously highlighted by wrong-headed people, and it will set up a situation that could grow to be something much worse.

First, I cite Byron Warner's answer in noting that the proposal says:

This does not include tour buses, airport shuttles, jitneys, charter buses, or limousines.

The tech company shuttles in fact do not do anything that these other buses don't do. The ""hey, the city can charge big rich companies for money by leveraging negative public sentiment"" shakedown dynamic is definitely at play here. 

On a ""help pay for city upkeep"" basis, it really would make a lot more sense to charge tour buses and charter buses similar fees (costs thus borne by visiting tourism dollars) but we don't, because quite frankly bus stops aren't a rapidly depleteable resource.  No one who was protesting really feels that the bus stops are being ""overly run down"" by these tech shuttles - bus stops last for decades regardless of how many buses stop in front of them.  Bus stop upkeep isn't a real issue.

Nor are the buses a drain on city resources.  People correctly point out that they alleviate traffic and are good for the environment.  Those things are very good, and it is foolish to oppose them or increase the cost of doing them.  If anything, we should be subsidizing more buses (more mass transit) that connects the city with the Peninsula!

Perhaps most importantly, there is a pernicious effect to taking payment from large companies to legitimize their usage of public resources.  Let's say this proposal works, at first - the companies pay the fees, and the protestors are temporarily mollified.  But they won't stay that way - because absolutely nothing has been done to resolve the underlying issues of gentrification and class issues and rent.  So the discontent will reappear.  At that point, the easiest thing to do (and I am confident it will happen) is that the tech companies will be asked - or even offer - to pay more.  Maybe $200k/year.  Maybe a $1m/year.

At that point you have a really weird situation.  You have these paying clients who use the bus stops, and you have free users of the bus stops.  The tail begins to wag the dog.  The people who pay will have influence.  The companies will ask that because they pay that much, maybe the city could provide a bit better police protection to prevent protesters from breaking bus windows.  After all, they are now paying to use the bus stops, right?  Wouldn't that be fair?  And the city may conclude that yeah, $1m/year can certainly cover a bit of better police coverage because it's also paying for some more police coverage elsewhere, it's net improving the city.  Now you have protesters being kept away from the buses by the jackboots.

That's just one possible example.  But it's the sort of thing you head towards once a city starts to have corporate clients paying for part of its infrastructure.  It can get pretty ugly.

And most importantly, it's not solving the core issue.  It's actually making it worse by creating a two-tier structure exactly along the lines of ""rich tech companies"" vs ""poor non-tech workers.""

I don't think it's a good proposal.


-----

EDIT: I don't usually do this, but there's a comment below that I think deserves to be promoted here because I think it makes a common point (thanks Govind Kabra):

Have you considered that if these buses were not available, a large fraction, if not majority, of these employees will relocate closer to where company is located (south bay). Commute on 101/280/caltrain are so awful in comparison to company shuttle.

I'm genuinely surprised that this is a notion people think is true.  It's not.  Most people who take the buses do not make their living location decision based on the presence or absence of the bus service.

I know this because I've worked at two fairly large Peninsula companies (PayPal, and Facebook during the early days, before the buses).  At each, there was a subset of employees who wanted to live in SF and they would simply do so, and accept the commute - driving, train, carpooling, etc.  Once the buses were set up (at Facebook), some of those employees then took the bus because it was certainly more convenient.  While certainly there is a non-zero number of employees for whom the buses may have tipped their decision, it's not at all the majority or even close to it.  Large fractions of Peninsula employees have been living in San Francisco for decades now and commuting down to the Peninsula.  This isn't a new thing that the buses have enabled in large numbers.

The buses were not created so that more employees could live in San Francisco.  They were created so that companies could extract another hour or so of productive work from their employees each day by putting wifi on the buses, and to some degree to reduce the amount of car commuting (green reasons).

When you make a decision to live in San Francisco, you do not make the commute portion of that decision based on a bus because they are ""unreliable.""  The buses have very limited schedules (they run a couple times in the morning, then a couple times in the evening).  So they only fit if you are close to the 9-5 or 10-6 workdays.  Many tech workers work odd hours or have occasional crunch time where they stay late.  So in deciding where to live, they have to factor in the necessity that they are already going to be driving themselves or taking the train (runs at more hours) some fraction of the time.  The fact that they can sometimes take the bus when its service hours line up in a way that is convenient to them ends up being a bonus (for them and the company) but not something they can count on as a part of the ""where will I live"" calculus.  People who live in San Francisco and work on the Peninsula do so because they like the culture of San Francisco and are willing to stomach the commute.  The buses do not exist to enable this, they exist to make commutes more efficient and to extract more productive time from the employees.

Secondly, the narrow segment of employees for whom the bus actually tipped their decision to live in San Francisco is not a population large enough to have affected rents.

Rather, rents in San Francisco have risen dramatically because many more startups have moved to San Francisco.  Ironically, it is actually the tech companies in San Francisco that are feeding this rise in rent - they are well-funded and can pay high salaries, and people move into San Francisco to work at these companies in large numbers, ironically, to shorten their commute.  (Also, some of these companies are founded there because the young founders want to live in SF) There are many, many more tech workers who have moved to San Francisco to work close to their startups than who moved to San Francisco because they can take a bus down to the Peninsula. It's part of a broader trend of young people moving into urban centers - in this case, many of them are highly-paid tech workers.

A partial list of tech companies located in San Francisco, some of whom employ hundreds of employees: Airbnb, Asana, Dropbox, Zynga, Twitter, Square, Pinterest, Stripe, Uber, Lyft, Exec, StumbleUpon, Yelp, Github, Climate Corporation, Path, Crowdtilt, One Kings Lane.

There are far fewer rising tech companies now on the Peninsula - the main ones I can think of are Quora and Evernote, maybe you could count Palantir.

San Francisco is the place where you start your company now.  This is why people keep moving here, and why rents are so high.  The few busloads of Google and Facebook employees don't outweigh the literally hundreds of new startups in San Franscisco and their new employees.

Yishan-Wong,"We get this question a lot every time news comes out about reddit doing anything that could possibly make money.  Personally, I think it is a symptom of one of the bizarre distorted beliefs in the startup echo chamber that making money is an evil thing that only big Old Economy companies do, so any time a startup starts to do it they must be wrong in the head or something.

Anyhow, as far as they have ever indicated to me, Conde Nast[1] seems to have little interest in seeing reddit monetize more quickly. Conde Nast is quite content for reddit to keep on growing its pageviews without making much money because their association with reddit's reach and influence has been beneficial for their other technology initiatives.  Since my concern is only reddit and securing our long-term future as a self-sustaining entity, I feel it's essential to experiment with and develop different business initiatives in parallel with our community-building efforts.

I feel that it's useful for reddit to develop multiple business initiatives beyond advertising because different business models offer different degrees of flexibility against shifting macroeconomic factors, and they also affect the eventual character of the company.  For instance, advertising ends up being a B2B enterprise sales model (you are ultimately trying to make large sales to big buyers, see [2]) and oftentimes exists in tension with user product.  Subscription models (e.g. reddit gold) allow you to turn your user base into your customer, which help align certain product incentives.  E-commerce marketplaces like the redditgifts marketplace offer yet another model, where you bring together merchants and buyers, and have totally different economics (and hurdles) than both subscription or advertising.  Plus, we think that there is an underserved demand on reddit for users who want to create products to sell to the community, but at the same time we don't want promotion of those products to unnecessarily pollute the community-discussion areas, so a separate marketplace might be needed.  There are a lot of possibilities.

Yishan-Wong,"Hahahahahahahaha.

There is a board.  Only one member of the board is also an employee of Conde Nast (Bob Sauerberg, President of Conde Nast).

One of the most interesting things to me is that when I joined reddit, I found that even back when Conde Nast actually owned reddit, they exercised so little control over reddit that it was basically this ungoverned rogue entity.  True, they also didn't really fund it, which you could consider a form of control, but the team was basically ignored and allowed to make all their own decisions, including some pretty major ones like putting the source code for the whole site on github, which a big company would pretty much never do[1].

Post-spinoff, they continue to not be interested in controlling the business - they don't seem interested at all in telling reddit management what to do.  They are extremely cooperative whenever we ask them for a favor or an intro, but beyond that they don't ever try to get us to do anything.  Of course, this means that reddit is entirely responsible for formulating and executing its own strategy and if we screw up, we can't blame it on anyone but ourselves.

Yishan-Wong,"redditgifts does two things: it runs a large number of gift exchanges, and it runs redditgifts marketplace.

1) The gift exchanges aren't really a business, they just facillitate gift-giving around the world.  The primary output of this is happiness, and the cost to run it is very low.

You can watch Dan McComas, the head of redditgifts, talk about the gift exchanges (including the story of the first redditgifts Secret Santa) in this TEDx talk:


2) redditgifts marketplace has a fairly straightforward business strategy: it brings together merchants who make and sell unique gift items and people who want to buy and send gifts.
  "
Yishan-Wong,"At the behest of users who enjoy the annual Secret Santa gift exchange, redditgifts has created a number of other gift exchanges throughout the year.

The largest of these gift exchanges is Arbitrary Day, a made-up reddit holiday diametrically opposite to Christmas on the calendar, on June 25th. 

There are numerous other gift exchanges like a socks exchange, Halloween exchange, NFL exchange, magnets exchange, Arrested Development exchange, book exchange, snack exchange, etc.  (See more here: a reddit gift exchange perfect for you)  You could basically be sending and receiving stuff from strangers all year round, if you wanted.
  "
Yishan-Wong,"redditgifts has the distinction of being the world's largest Secret Santa gift exchange. 

Every year around November, people from all over the world sign up to be matched with another person to send a gift to, in the manner of a Secret Santa.  In 2013, over 100,000 people from 161 countries signed up and participated in Secret Santa[1].

redditgifts is a division of reddit, and it also does two other things:

First, it runs a large number of other gift exchanges throughout the year.  See redditgifts: What are other good use cases for redditgifts besides Christmas / Secret Santa?

Second, redditgifts runs the redditgifts marketplace, a marketplace of merchants who specialize primarily in customized or handmade goods.  With fours years of experience in facillitating internet gift-giving between strangers and friends (and strangers who become friends), the redditgifts team is putting together a marketplace of merchants focused on creating a unique gift experience for people above and beyond the usual ""buy some crap online"" experience.  For example, one of the marketplace merchants makes every box they pack smell like freshly-baked cookies.  (I'm not sure how they manage to do this, but they do it) The aim is that when you are looking for a truly unique and thoughtful gift for someone special, redditgifts marketplace is where you'll find it.

David-Armano,"One word. Leadership

I've been successful at influencing the culture at agencies but never actually changing it. That's because change does not happen unless very senior leaders right up to the top are actively involved and leading it. Finally I wised up and chose to join a firm where the CEO and I shared a nearly identical vision and many in the firm share similar views and values. It's great to have grassroot movements within a firm which get people talking, but business models and culture change don't typically happen unless the top layer gets behind it.

David-Armano,"The NY Times is just reporting what regular users of Twitter already know. Follower counts are an indicator but not a very good one and yes, they can be and are gamed frequently with the assistance of shady web services. Here are a few more critical Twitter indicators:

Lists:
Being included on lists gives us two clues. 1. Being included on thousands or more signals that you are visible. 2. The categories people use to classify you tells you something about the topics you have influence in: This is known as ""topical influence"" and it's really what counts in influence.

Retweets:
These tell you something about how willing people are to amplify your messages and help them spread. A retweet essentially says ""this is something I want my network to see"". It's Twitter's version of viral loops.

@Replies
These signal how much others want to talk to you or intentionally tag you, and also serves as an indicator for how willing you are to engage and tag others. Less replies signals less social interactions and more broadcast.

Follower Ratio
Generally, if a user on Twitter follows a disproportionate amount of users than follow them, it signals their desire to accumulate followers. Not always, but often. A 50/50 ratio translates to someone following back anyone who follows them, which includes spammers. Twitter users who follow significantly less than are followed indicate some selection process.

Tweet volume
This simply indicates how prolific a user is. Those with high volumes who retain high levels of engagement, list counts, retweets, and a healthy ratio are likely providing some type of value. High volume Twitter accounts with suspect ratios, low engagement, etc may have a high noise to signal ratio

Favorites
Getting favorited frequently does mean something, though because Twitter users leverage Favorites so differently, it's nearly impossible to discern exactly what, other than you triggered a behavior (the action to Favorite) for some reason.

Quality of connections
The most difficult to quantify and probably THE most important indicator is the quality and RELEVANCE of who follows you on Twitter and who you follow back. Targeting the right audience and earning their attention (and Trust) is ultimately the best (and softest metric).

Follower counts (and ratios) are an indicator, but only one of several and one of the easiest to game.

David-Armano,"It's all in how you define ""professional"". User experience guru Jakob Nielsen does not have the most visually appealing Website:

http://www.useit.com/

However it hasn't undermined his credibility as far as I can tell given his status in that niche. It could perhaps be because while the site isn't very visually appealing, it is usable which is consistent with what Nielsen advocates.

Perhaps what makes a Website less credible is when it is misaligned with the values and promises of the organization behind it. If for example a company prides itself in innovation and it's site doesn't demonstrate any degree of innovation whatsoever, one could say that would affect credibility.

Another way to look at this. Aligning your digital presence with what your company stands for may be the most professional thing to do.

David-Armano,"Here are two:

1: Too big, too fast
Facebook has literally changed the way individuals, groups and organizations communicate, engage and interact. It's been credited with playing a role in recent revolutions as well as being careless with the privacy of its members. Facebook is a force and it's only going to get bigger and more integrated into our lives. For this reason, a lot of folks will be keeping an eye on it from governments to activists to watchdogs to the media. Facebook can in a sense become a victim of it's own success if it moves to quickly or draws too much attention to itself?potentially prompting calls for regulation.

2: The open web
The fact that I'm answering this question on Quora (as opposed to Facebook) is telling. While Facebook may be the most powerful social network on the Web?it is NOT the Web, but a vast network?an ecosystem that exists on it. Facebook is doing a very good job of integrating into the open web in many cases?again, pointing to this example, I will publish a version of this answer on Facebook?(but also on Twitter). Facebook's future depends partially on how it continues to ""hook"" into the open web and create ways to monetize this integration without violating privacy.
  "
David-Armano,"Engagement won't replace impressions but it's the new kid on the block which is here to stay and the two will need to get along in order for a business to meet it's objectives. And let's clarify engagement. A video game is a form of interactive engagement (with technology) but a video game where you connect with other live human beings contains elements of social engagement. It's the human factor which makes engagement social. 

Several marketing efforts have been successful at generating buzz or lots of conversations producing a brief spike in awareness (think Old Spice). Ad agencies will have no problem selling in these types of ideas as CMOs are under tremendous pressure to have anything they do go ""viral"".

However, Where CMOs and the agencies they hire will struggle is to create sustainable marketing, communication and even business models which support social engagement in the forms of community management, customer service, and any area where a digital participant expects that they can engage via a person associated with a company or brand and not some automated service designed to remove human intervention.

There are four key areas that a firm for a ""connected age"" will need to be effective, even if they don't operate in a full service capacity:

Paid: Programs which require bought media.

Earned: Programs which depend on third party validation.

Owned: Programs which leverage assets of the organization/business/brand.

Social: Programs which leverage social platforms and include engagement as a way of doing business.

These are not pillars which exist in an assembly line model, rather they overlap and bleed into one another. Firms which recalibrate to focus on these overlaps will be the ones who evolve in the right direction.
  "
David-Armano,"Depends on how you view ""design"". Before getting into social, I acted as a UX team lead meaning that I led teams of visual designers, writers, information architects (that's what they called them back then). And I either led the experience strategy or worked with strategists/business analysts. Prior to that, I did some hands on graphic and Web design work early on in my career and it used to be online but not anymore. However, the ""visual thinking archive"" are ""designs"" I've actually done either using Illustrator or Powerpoint:

If you are looking for something more ""creative"", here are some sketches I've been doing on my iPad.

I don't think I'm a good visual designer. From time to time, I use what I did retain from design school and my first few years as a designer to simplify complex ideas and distill them into actionable strategic frameworks. I'm ok at that. I'm happy to leave the visual design to the pros. I still tap my background in UX from time to time. Ultimately, I still help solve problems and am really interested in the business and sociological side of the ""social"" stuff because it's disruptive to big business and is literally changing how we interact, communicate and connect.

David-Armano,"Apple has some of the most effective marketing on the planet. And PR too. As does Nike, Virgin... I could go on and on. I can't think of a company that doesn't engage in some kind of ""marketing"" activity. But there is good marketing and not so good marketing. The good kind is usually aligned with truths surrounding the company or brand. The bad kind, is misleading--often times intentionally and far from genuine. If marketing was only for sucky products, some of the best companies in the world would not have marketing divisions. And yet, they do.

David-Armano,"How about rephrasing the question: Should every business have a blog? No, not every business should blog. Should every business have a strategy behind how they produce, curate, aggregate and distribute content?

Yes.

Because pretty much every business already generates some form of content. Most have brochures or reports of some kind. But increasingly content is becoming the doorway to being found through what's commonly known as ""organic search"" which is a leading way people find information on the web. The content your business touches can also influence your online reputation. Content can be a blog post?and it can also be a response on a third party website.

Move the conversation beyond blogging and into all forms of content and how it affects metrics such as page rank, views, shares, and money made/saved and the answer is that every business should re-evaluate the thinking behind the content associated with them.

David-Armano,"Perhaps an apology from the very top would have been a better place to start. Followed up by a call for support to everyone to help turn things around.

In the above model the Social Media Manager (or director) oversees efforts across multiple brands or divisions. Each specific division then may have strategists, content teams, community managers and any other discipline which has been covered in this question. The SMM may report to a very senior executive in either communications or perhaps marketing or even customer service depending on the business. They are responsible not only for the output of multiple teams but also social media policy and guidelines for entire org.

David-Armano,"""Edelman trust index is a great piece of work"" and this is where one really needs to stop and think. If an open report puts value into the ecosystem, and multiple stakeholders benefit then it is a service and more importantly serves a purpose (in the case of this research it provides insights into who is trusted and it relies on the analysis of the community to help determine why). I'm not sure why being a non-profit that supports open research is any more honorable than being a for profit that provides a valuable service. Altimeter, a for profit boutique puts out some great open research as well and it doesn't matter that they are for profit and small?it's just valuable.
  "
David-Armano,"It really comes down to the business model and what the business can support. Outsourcing may not be the best description to detail leveraging partners to help with community management. We know that many businesses work with partners to help with areas such as customer service in order to scale. Some are more successful than others. One could argue that customer service should never be outsourced, yet it remains a standard business practice.

I've found though that a hybrid model can be effective for companies who need partners in activities such as community management. Having a social media manager or director of community management who can oversee activities from both internal and external resources for example.

And also, consider that some community management activities could be handled ""in-house"" (like direct engagement with the community) while other activities such as content management can be executed with partners.

It comes down to the needs of the business and community and doing what makes sense for both. Here are two staffing models to consider

Internal (partners do not perform community management)
http://www.flickr.com/photos/785...

External (community management through business partner)

  "
David-Armano,"These are not metrics per say, but important factors or ""pillars"" that I like to think about when analyzing influence. They are:

Reach:
The most obvious, this relates to the size and potency of an individuals ""social graph"" or if you are looking at it from a traditional perspective it's the ""platform"" an individual has which helps them be heard.

Proximity:
This is likely overlooked with the exception of those who study network dynamics. Proximity indicates the relationships between people and how they are connected. Close proximity or ties typically indicate friends relatives etc, while loose ties have less proximity. Both ties however can be effective in influencing behavior

Expertise:
Perceived expertise in topics or subject matter establishes influence as well though is difficulty to pin down and measure. There are correlations between reputation and authority here as well. But if an individual establishes themselves as having expertise (validated by trusted sources) this becomes a major factor.

Relevancy:
The relevancy of influentials to their communities, networks or audiences is also a significant indicator which affects how much influence one has the potential to yield within that group or community.

Credibility:
Established by the activities of individuals through their thoughts, actions and what they generate. Indicators of credibility are tied to reputation, word of mouth, referrals etc.

Trust:
Often a result of several of the above factors but extremely critical in the effectiveness of influencing a thought, behavior or action. Friends and peers can be trusted sources in cases while in other cases, known or unknown entities with perceived expertise.

While there are likely other important factors?these are good indicators though some are difficult to quantify (such as credibility). However the amount of times an individual is mentioned by others on a specific topic and the link to how much visibility is generated are metrics which can be measured.

While the debate around this topic is interesting to follow, there remains a shortage of talent of people who acutually have baseline business skills and a really good grasp of how social works (because it is different).

I began writing a blog and nobody heard me, and that changed quickly after years of participating, adding value to the social system and being present. Now when I answer questions such as this?they are often read due to the network I have cultivated over the years.

So, I would say the answer is yes, the threat is real to Quora and the entire social Web. The voices which are often loudest are the ones which have built up followings. But, Quora like most social systems, while technically ""unfair"" is also democratic?meaning those who have value to offer can be heard, but they will have to work at it.

A complex issue to be sure, and Quora's social system will probably experience what we saw in the blogosphere. A few, then many, then many but only a few who really stand out. Hopefully those who do offer the most value here are tied to the quality of theirs answers (and opinions).

2. Attract and retain the kind of talent that got them there: Google has lost talent to Facebook or employees have gone to pursue their own startup. Figure out what it takes to attract and keep the hungry and talented who are looking to change the world.

3. Lead with a vision: Zuckerberg's hoodies are rumored to sport insignias with his vision. He's got one though, and it's felt even at the user experience. The vision and ability to execute against it can't be understated.

When a company invites customers to help improve, define and create new products or services (see Starbucks My Idea) then we're talking multiple business functions.

David-Armano,"One way is to empower members of a community who are already loyal to the brand and give them the tools to convert others. The common term for this is a ""brand ambassador"". Microsoft's MVP program which has been around for a while is a nice example of this.

In this particular case, the focus on MVP's or ""Most Valuable Professionals"" is on rewarding active participants in the hopes that they become even more engaged (and loyal) to the brand. This type of initiative is different from traditional loyalty programs which seek to reward through transaction (points) as opposed to participation such as helping other customers. An army of ambassadors can help customers which in turn reflects well on the brand strengthening loyalty to it.

1) The extra time it takes to 'find' the right answer to a design problem. Often a designer can spend an entire day (or more) and then realize at the end of the day, that the direction isn't working. This is an important part of how designers work, however, and can't be sped up or optimized.

2) Lack of understanding of conversion optimization. This is the process of constantly working on improving conversion rates by A/B and multivariate testing. Inexperienced designers will launch the site and believe their job is done, or worse, never consider how their design will affect conversion rates. If your designer doesn't understand conversion optimization (or doesn't think it's important) then you either need to train them or let them go.

Jeremiah-Owyang,"A Breakdown of the Scoble Effect in Five Phases.

First of all, I've been watching Robert closely for over 6 years. I knew him when he was the chief blog evangelist at Microsoft, at his book launch party at Techcrunch's backyard and went to work with him at PodTech for a year.  We're still very much good friends and our families enjoy time together.  Yet while I know him well, I'll give you the straight truth on how he does it.

It's part of my job (and inquisitive behavior) to break things into small pieces and look for patterns, and I'll do that for this influencer.  I am an Industry Analyst and have devoted my career to studying this space, watching influence patterns is a key part of the role.

Scoble has a cyclical pattern to all disruptive technologies that break down in the following process.  I've seen him do the following for Blogs, Twitter, LiveStreaming, Facebook, Friendfeed, FourSquare, Cinch, and most recently, Quora.

1) Going Wide on the Market. First of all, he places 'bets' on most disruptive and new technologies, also known as the ""shiny syndrome"".  This is his very difficult to do, since it requires him to be constantly on the ground, his show helps him to meet all these young startups while they are still in their garages.

2) Prime and Pump. While most of his bets never take off, some do, he can 'feel' the signals from other early influencers and then starts to pump the market.  He can do this in a combination of tweets, or blog posts.  Expect his blog posts to say ""Why I love X"" and then later a contrasting post ""Why I hate it"" or ""Why I was wrong"".  This leads to great controversy which sets up for the third round.

3) Poster Child Association. Once the first two rounds are established, Robert double downs on the disruptive technology and becomes the poster boy.  By associating his brand with the rapid growth, he can make claim to it's success, and will likely be invited in by the entrepreneurial team for intimate discussions and media opportunities. 

4) Break and Push.  This is the most critical phase, as it's designed to cause the maximum amount of controversy which stems rapid market discussions.  In this phase, Robert will 'game' the systems (getting the most Twitter followers, Scraping contacts in Facebook till he got pushed off, dominating friendfeed, and getting to 5000 friends in Facebook).  At this point, it becomes clear that he is the dominant player, and the community starts to resent it.  He pushes the game further till there's backlash, often resulting in Techcrunch slams, and then Techmeme fodder.  At this point the 'push' occurs where he can then use this energy to the next venture, listed in the next phase.

5) Fall off and Renew. At this stage, the climax has been reached.  Depending on adoption of the disruptive technology, Robert will either ride the growth curve for a few months, or go off to the next technology.  If the technology gets mainstream appeal, mainstream celebrities will join, pushing Robert off the top slot --at that point he must go to the next disruptive technology.

Summary: Robert Scoble is a technology influencer that has a pattern of early adoption and influencer behaviors.  He has market instinct and media savvy, and knows how to sniff and pump the next technologies.  The downside to this approach is he cannot achieve the full market benefit as he constantly must move to the next disruptive technology.  Expect Robert to follow this continual pattern over the coming years as disruptive technologies continue to occur at a faster pace.  There is only one Scoble, no one else to date has been able to achieve this effect.

  "
Dave-McClure,"as jeff notes, typical fund investors tend to be institutional, corporate, or family office groups (collections of rich people), as well as high net worth folks (individual rich people).

some of the more successful & well-known micro-VC funds raise from the same sources as larger VC funds, however since most of us haven't been around very long (<5 years) and start out with smaller funds (<$50M), it's difficult to raise money from traditional VC investors because of our limited track record, and because they can't / don't write checks smaller than $5-10M. they may also have max ownership restrictions where they can't be more than 10-20% of the capital in any one fund.

in any case, 500 Startups first fund started out with a mix of individuals (lots of friends we knew from PayPal, Google, Facebook, YouTube, Linkedin, Twitter, etc), corporate investors, and some VC funds / individual partners. gradually as we have gotten more established & raised larger funds, we have begun aiming for larger investors from more traditional sources.

however, we still have a large # of small investors who helped us get started early, and we appreciate them a hell of a lot. in particular, some high-profile VCs & entrepreneurs were kind enough to write us small checks in the beginning, which helped us a LOT to get off the ground & legitimize us to other investors.
  "
Dave-McClure,"aS
  "
Dave-McClure,"all these answers are nonsense & mathematically flawed. it has absolutely nothing to do with returns.

the reason is because they want to hold board seats in the company, and have controlling stakes in governance.

there is *NO* good logic behind VCs taking 20% of individual companies in order to generate returns. they could take a lower % of more co's, or a higher % of fewer co's, and still achieve target returns (altho note that most do not).

more likely, the 20% ownership target is  practical for traditional VCs that aim to hold board seats -- given most companies only have 3-5 board seats in the earlier years, it would be difficult to obtain and/or defend a board seat without owning a proportional amount of preferred shares of the company that the board seat represents. thus, a 20% target stake would be enough to both 1) acquire and 2) keep a board seat where there might be a small # available.

this is the only rational explanation why VCs aim for some arbitrary ownership %, other than most people simply repeating this as an industry best practice, without having the faintest idea why or how it came about.

if someone has a better reason I'm all ears, but I haven't heard any persuasive argument in the past decade or more I've been involved in the business.

(people tend to copy what others have done in the past, without investigating whether the past was any good ;)

for the record: 500 Startups does not believe this is the only viable strategy for good VC fund performance. in fact, we believe a larger sample size (>100) of co's in early-stage portfolios is a much better strategy for improving returns, and we generally do not care much about taking board seats nor ownership %... however we *DO* care about valuation, and we believe investing early at lower cost will give us a better shot at good returns.
  "
Dave-McClure,"well, at least for many small funds the 2% part of 2-20 doesn't usually work so well... or at least, spreading it out over 10 years doesn't work well. note that most funds operate for ten years, and charge fees for most if not all of those years.

many small funds (including ours) structure fees so that they happen earlier in the fund life cycle, when most of the work (& costs) related to executing the fund investments happen.

for example: in our first fund, we had a front-loaded fee schedule that started at 3% for the first two years, then decrements 0.5% every two years, ending up at 1% for the last two years.

In our most recent fund, we actually reduced fees overall to only 1.5% average for 10 years, but made fees 3% for the first two years, then 2% for the next two years, then only 1% for the next four years, and ending with only 0.5% for the last two years.

for more info on how 500 business model works, see my previous Quora answer here:
Dave McClure's answer to 500 Startups: What is 500 Startups' business model?

I've also heard other funds may charge a flat rate amount that is collected at the beginning of the fund life. note that this might be risky if the fund manager runs out of money too quickly, and doesn't have enough left to finish executing the fund strategy.

in any case, small funds will very often have higher expenses on a percentage basis than large funds, particularly early in the first few years of fund life, and thus might need to consider other fee strategies than just the standard 2% for ten years.

ultimately, altho percentage-based fee structures have been a historical industry standard, a budget-based fee structure that is matched to the actual timing of fund expenses probably makes more sense.

at 500 Startups, we have had to be creative in coming up with other revenue sources than just depending on management fees in order to cover our costs. this has worked well for us, and has resulted in us charging less in fees and not depending as much on fund size to drive our budget.
  "
Dave-McClure,"i don't know how other accelerators would respond, but i'd suggest if it's 500 then you bring it up with Christine, Parker, or me.

not sure whether we'd immediately jump into the new idea/venture, however if you're facing challenges with the previous venture & team, it would probably be useful to discuss it with the 500 team and discuss options.

more likely there would be some collateral damage to reputations if you *don't* bring it up with us, if you're feeling like you're ready to bail out.  no time like the present to face the music and figure out next steps.

good luck :)
  "
Dave-McClure,"they count for something.  however, the product and current level of traction probably count for more.
  "
Dave-McClure,"it's pretty hard to come up with a realistic & quantitative answer here. however, let's just say that among a pool of random startup companies the % is going to be pretty small, probably less than 1 in 100. if we then filter the set of candidates to be only those that have actually raised some money or have some decent traction -- say, those with at least $100K in funding, and/or $100K/year in revenue, then you might have at least single-digit % likelihood.

among our portfolio, we aim for 5-10% of our companies to have 20x or better outcomes, and another 20-30% of our companies to have 5x or better outcomes. still, we may not be that good.  my guess is that perhaps 1 to 3 in 10 of our entrepreneurs has a shot at a $1M payday and/or $10M+ exit at some point.

but the majority of them never have any exit whatsoever... it's a tough business.
  "
Dave-McClure,"1) most everyone on the 500 investment team is empowered to do deals, so you shouldn't take anyone for granted.

2) even folks who don't invest have significant influence on our deals, including other founders & mentors.

3) if you DO try to get to me or Christine, you'll find we are both busy as shit, and we will likely refer you back to our venture partners, mentors, or founders to get their opinions. 

4) if you try to work around or ignore the folks we send you to speak with, we will get pissed that you aren't respecting our process, and that you are essentially dissing the rest of our network. bad move, punk.

5) finally, even if you're working a traditional network that isn't 500, you'll find that gathering info & influence from non-decision makers can be helpful, and ignoring or trying to work around them can get them pissed / get you black-balled.

in short: the conventional wisdom that non-partners can't say ""yes"" and can only say ""no"" is perhaps true, but naive in the sense that getting a deal done often involves a number of influencers who are *not* decision-makers. 

ignore them at your peril... especially at 500 Startups.
  "
Dave-McClure,"yes, in fact many angel investors probably aspire to become VCs... usually because we're not very rich. typically, the independence of an angel investor is much more desirable than having all the fiduciary responsibilities of a VC who manages OPM (""Other People's Money""). however, for most angel investors who don't have $10-100M to invest, raising a fund may be the only way for them to acquire the necessary capital to do significant # investments.

for me personally, i started off doing angel investing around 2003-2004 with about $300K that i had from selling some stock options while i was at PayPal (2001-2004), and i invested in about 2-4 deals per year at between $10-100K, or about 1 deal every 3-4 months at around $25K.  however, i wasn't very thoughtful on my allocation strategy, and invested over 1/2 my available capital in the first year. then later, I was stretching to do investments at even $5-10K in the last few years. a few times, i did part-time consulting to make money so I could do more investing -- once i even sold my wife's car in order to get money to do a deal! (insert crackhead/alcoholic joke here). however, regardless of process I was fortunate to invest in several companies that later had decent exits of ~10x or more, including Slideshare, Mint.com, and Mashery.

even though I made a lot of mistakes, I learned a lot and it was a useful apprenticeship to go through before starting my own fund. there were many things about legal structure, company formation, founder-investor interaction, and other topics that i knew little about when i started investing, even though i considered myself a knowledgeable software engineer & internet marketing geek. i'm sure i wouldn't have had enough experience to do VC investing without going through this period, as well as later working at Founders Fund.

in any case, by 2007-2008 i realized my angel investments were going to take awhile to mature, and soon i was going to run out of money to invest! so the only way i could keep doing investing was to raise my own fund, or join another firm. altho i was planning to setup a small fund of $5-10M to get started, my timing sucked -- trying to raise even a small amount of capital in summer 2008 turned out to be very challenging (due to the financial crisis in aug/sept 2008), and as a result i wasn't able to raise my own fund (yet).

but as luck would have it, my alternative wasn't so bad -- i was fortunate to get a job offer from Sean Parker (thx Sean!) at Founders Fund to help them with marketing, and i was also able to convince him/them to let me manage a small ~$2-3M portfolio of early-stage investments. besides being perhaps the only person hired in Venture Capital in Q4 2008, i was extremely lucky as a rookie VC to get the [very unusual] opportunity to make over 40 small investments in the ensuing year and a half. Companies that I got to invest in included Twilio, SendGrid, Wildfire, Credit Karma, Lyft (then Zimride), and TaskRabbit, among several others that went on to both small & larger success (as well as bunch that didn't). overall, i did ok on investing -- maybe more lucky than good, but well enough they didn't fire me.

after investing on behalf of Founders Fund and the Facebook fbFund (which i also managed for a period of time in 2009), and after the market recovered in 2010, i was able to finally convince a group of investors (which included Founders Fund & a few other VCs and entrepreneurs) to help back my first fund. in late July of 2010, we did the first closing of 500 Startups Fund I, and eventually we did a final closing at slightly over $29M. and we were off to the races.

note: these days, I'd recommend aspiring angels & VCs check out the Syndicates feature on Angel List, which allows more active angel investors to coordinate funds from other investors, without all the initial complexity and legal hassle / cost of raising a fund. (see http://AngelList.co for more info)

in summary:
- raising a venture capital fund is hard, but possible if you keep at it -- even if you aren't super-rich, and even if you haven't had a $100M+ exit
- many angel investors aspire to be venture capitalists, usually because it will bring them access to larger amounts of capital to invest (& perhaps more vanity / marketing visibility too)
- investing Other People's Money (OPM) is VASTLY different from investing your own money, and carries with it a number of new, different, and far more complex responsibilities
- be careful what you wish for, you might just get it ;)

Dave-McClure,"no, we debit the $15K out of the initial investment capital. (sometimes we do it in 2 pieces, but we've never billed program fees to anyone *before* sending them capital).

to further clarify:
- 500 Startups charges a program fee to cover a number of costs, not just rent, but also overhead for 500 staff, legal & accounting costs, food, etc. (note: we aren't going to Tahiti on the program fees ;)
- for tax purposes, the program fee is charged by a separate incubator entity, not our investment fund... we can't mix services revenue and investment returns.
- on a net basis, the amount of capital provided to accelerator companies (usually $50K investment - $15K program fees = $35K remaining) is still more than most other programs provide. however, your mileage ma vary.

in summary: we feel quite confident there is a ton of value in joining the 500 Startups accelerator program, and the ongoing benefit for 500 alumni is similar or greater to that of top ivy league schools or business schools which charge far more (and, who don't invest any capital).

Dave-McClure,"most of our negotiation tactics aren't very advanced or thoughtful. we'd rather not be known for being too smart at negotiating, but rather for being helpful.

generally speaking: we try hard to be useful and transparent to most of our companies, and as a result we hope they treat us right and don't fuck us over.

that said, when we feel like people are negotiating hard with us, we will probably match that behavior. if they don't feel the need to do that, then we probably won't either.

a few things we do consider important:
- we are pretty sensitive to valuation, but we don't care much about ownership; since we are usually a small-check investor relative to other participants, and our value-add is rated highly by most founders, most folks will cut us a break on valuation & this is part of our strategy.
- we always ask for information rights & [some] pro-rata rights, so that we can understand how the company is doing, and so we can invest in future rounds if the things are going well. note that we don't usually play a lead role in most financings, but we do follow-on in a minority role often.
- in convertible note financings, we typically ask for a minimum 2x return clause in case the company sells prior to a priced round. we believe this is a reasonable ask that is becoming a market standard, since we aim to make a venture return and we aren't bankers... we're not trying to fuck with you.
- in cases where there is a talent acquisition or small exit, we know we won't likely have much leverage... however if founders are walking away with a decent payday (say, more than a million bucks) then we hope you won't forget how we supported you in the beginning, and we hope you won't let acquirers (or other investors) fuck us over. still, we know it will happen. but don't expect us to forget when it does. in return, we will do our best not to be assholes.

in summary: most games aren't zero sum, and we'd rather be the nice guy and finish the race with a smaller percentage of the stakes and our reputation intact, than vice versa. so we try hard to be transparent & earnest. this does not mean we are pushovers, however, and we are in this to make money. as noted above, we do remember when people fuck with us... and also, when they do not.

Dave-McClure,"about 20-30% of 500 Startups overall portfolio founders come from outside the US (about 150-175 co's are spread across 30+ countries, out of over 500 companies total). however, our accelerator program has a higher % of international founders, and in recent batches has been around 50%. our percentage from outside the US has been rising over time, as we have been increasing our exposure to emerging markets around the world. we also have about 1/3 of our team (10 people) in/from international markets, including Brazil, Mexico, India, China, and SE Asia.

I can't speak for other programs like YC or Techstars, but my guess is the #s are more like 5-10% international, altho TechStars is starting to expand more internationally, and YC does bring some international founders to the US.

Dave-McClure,"there are several factors that influence our opinion of teams that apply for 500 Startups... they usually break down as follows:

0) objective, provable evidence you are awesome, that is indisputable & does not depend on anyone's opinion (ex: ""i sold a company for $100M, i created Ruby, i built an Eiffel Tower model out of popsicle sticks when i was 7"")

if there isn't objective proof, then we like to hear first-hand references that you're awesome, ideally from people we know, and ideally in a work situation:

1) are there existing ""500 Family"" (our team, our founders, or mentors) who have had a positive WORK-ing relationship with you, and are willing to comment positively about your skills / experience?
2) alternately, are there 500 Family members who have a NON-working or personal relationship with you, and will comment positively?
3) alternately are there non-500 Family members who have a WORK-ing relationship with you, and will comment positively?
4) is there ANYONE who will say ANYTHING positive, regardless of whether they've worked with you?

in summary, we care about:
0) indisputable, objective proof that you're awesome, OR
1) people in 500 Family who will reference a positive working relationship, OR
2, 3) other non-500 people OR other non-work relationship, OR
4) anyone who thinks you smell nice & aren't a complete idiot (like, your mom)

note: 0 or 1 is best.

Adam-Rifkin,"I'm going to do some research and post what I find here.

First off, there's the faq - help which says:

Please do not confuse banning with being caught by the spam filter. It is very rare to get your account completely banned. 99.9% of the time, following the spam filter instructions will resolve your issue.

Due to the nature of how banning works on reddit, nobody in /r/help can explain to you why your account has been banned. The reddit admins are the only people who can ban and unban people. One can speculate that you may have broken one of the rules or committed some form of Spam, cheating and the like.

You can try and contact the admins to get your ban revoked. It's extremely rare for the admins to reply and/or unban banned users though.

The ""being caught by the spam filter"" link does not work. Hopefully they'll fix that.

So, the FAQ indicates that:

It's very unlikely that the Reddit admins will re-instate an account that has been shadowbanned.
You are unlikely to ever hear from the Reddit admins about being shadowbanned.

In other words, once you're in hell, your chances are very good of staying there.

I guess you could just create a new account. This is suboptimal though if you've already paid money for Reddit gold, or you're proud of the fact that you've been a Redditor for 7 years.

If you want to see something really sad, check out the shadow ban subreddit.

It is filled with people who have abandoned all hope.

We help people who find gold nuggets floating in their social streams to publish those things back to the public Web -- where they can be found by others with the same interests.

We have two use cases:

Writers are people who save interesting things they find, and comment on the things other writers are stashing.
Readers are over 99% of PandaWhale's users. They are free to lurk all they want without logging in, and share PandaWhale discoveries on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, and other networks.

PandaWhale gives our writers tools to organize their own stashes, which are collections around interests.

PandaWhale gives our readers tools to follow any individual stashes, which lets them receive notifications when new interesting things are stashed.

PandaWhale's main competition is publishing to a blog. We believe that blogging is great, but it puts pressure on an author to maintain that blog all the time; by pooling the content we find together with a great community, PandaWhale's writers only post when we find something interesting. Our community is fun and loves to learn.

So I did some research on this and came to the same conclusion as Ryan Seacrest and Charlotte Willner's answer :

The neon shoes are a fashion statement.

And it doesn't hurt that they're great branding for Nike. Adidas is the official sponsor of the Olympics; Nike used what would have been their sponsor money instead to give away lots of free pairs of shoes to athletes.

Smart (but self-serving) marketing move because the color is so distinctive. Fashion-wise, bright colors are in this year.

Adam-Rifkin,"Not with everyone.

It's possible KPCB can repair its reputation with some people, but there are entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley who will never consider an investment from KPCB as a result of not only the allegations but also the way KPCB has handled itself since May 10, when the lawsuit was filed.

I found this article from Dan Primack of Fortune informative: http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2...

The article states that:

1. KPCB did not disclose the lawsuit to its limited investors ""because any awarded damages would almost certainly represent less than 10% of the firm's assets under management."" In other words, KPCB sees this as a financial matter, not a culture matter or a values matter.

2. The lawsuit will not get resolved anytime soon. This will create ongoing tension within KPCB -- ""If not, then the firm is staffed by robots.""

3. Entrepreneurs try to find the best partners for its businesses. This will weigh heavily in their decision to even consider KPCB at all: ""Even if Kleiner Perkins is able to mitigate certain specifics via its legal response -- or quickly reach an out-of-court settlement -- the word in Silicon Valley today is that the firm treats some of its female partners as inferiors (or worse). The suit also suggests that Kleiner has, at least once, put a partner on a portfolio company board more for that partner's own ego than for the company's best interests.""

I've talked with many entrepreneurs this week at several startup events who have taken KPCB off the list of firms they would consider for investment. They will not say so in public because they fear retribution against their startups for taking a stand.

For them, KPCB will not regain its reputation unless it takes steps like the ones mentioned in Anon User's answer ...

And for all of us who are appalled by gender discrimination, the lawsuit has increased awareness that Silicon Valley has a problem. This gives us the opportunity to double down on our efforts to break the glass ceilings of our industry: http://gigaom.com/2012/05/24/can...
  "
Adam-Rifkin,"tl;dr : Kleiner Perkins has an opportunity to change their reputation, but there are significant risks to their ability to do so.

I'm writing the following with no insight into their organization other than my own experiences with them in the past.

My first instinct is that Kleiner Perkins has a great opportunity to establish themselves as a leader with KPCB 15.

Kleiner Perkins led the ""A"" round of my first startup in 2000 (KnowNow; real-time Web enterprise software), and at that time they were a clear leader in software investing, having been the earliest venture investor in billion-dollar companies like Netscape, Amazon, and Google.

When I visited Kleiner Perkins for the first round of my second startup in 2005 (Renkoo; social consumer Web apps), partners there told me that they were more interested in Life Sciences and Green Technology than Internet startups.

What's interesting is that they passed over a lot of software deals in 2005 and 2006, just as software was starting to get huge again.

They watched as other firms got a great reputation investing in the early rounds of software companies that would later be worth more than $1 billion:
Greylock (Facebook, LinkedIn, Pandora, Airbnb, Tumblr);
Sequoia (YouTube, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Dropbox, Square);
Benchmark (Twitter, Instagram);
USV (Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga);
Bessemer (Yelp, Pinterest); and
Accel (Facebook, Groupon, Rovio), just to name a few examples.

Those software companies that Kleiner Perkins did get into early -- startups like Zynga, Flipboard, Path, and Klout -- were unusual choices. Among them, only Zynga has become a billion dollar company, and even then, Kleiner led the second round, not the first.

When Kleiner Perkins did invest in software companies like Facebook and Twitter and Groupon, they did so very late, after each of those companies were worth roughly $15 billion, $4 billion, and $6 billion, respectively.

So Kleiner Perkins now has a reputation in the startup circles I visit as a late-stage software investor.

But that can change. And clearly the firm wants to change.

Now, with KPCB15's focus, Kleiner Perkins has an opportunity to change their reputation back to an excellent early-stage software investor.

In particular, hiring Mike Abbott as managing director was a very smart move that substantially and immediately increases the firm's ability to attract the best young software startups. Entrepreneurial engineers want to work with him. Either of his first two investments -- Gumroad and Apcera -- could become billion-dollar companies, and they chose Kleiner Perkins because they wanted to work with Michael Abbott.

That's a great start. Hopefully Kleiner Perkins will continue to evolve in that direction, and make more early investments in software startups that could be huge.

What are the key risks for Kleiner Perkins right now?

Arrogance. Kleiner Perkins has a reputation for congratulating itself; many people in many Silicon Valley circles have told me this over the years. For an example, see Anonymous' answer to Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers: How is Kleiner Perkins regarded today?
The Sexual Harrassment Lawsuit. We don't know all the details and likely never will, and we don't know if Kleiner Perkins will win the suit. Public perception is likely damaged just by lawsuit itself. See also: Ellen Pao/KPCB Sexual Harassment Lawsuit: Will Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers be able to regain its reputation after Ellen Pao's sexual harassment lawsuit?

I've said it at the beginning and I'll conclude with it, too: Kleiner Perkins has an opportunity to change their reputation, but there are significant risks to their ability to do so.

Robert-Scoble-1,"Update. It's now almost a year since I got mine and I find my utility going down because Google has not yet fixed the major problems.

Voice response only works if you have a connection. Often I'm in a place, like Yellowstone, that has no connectivity.
You can only put 10 contacts into Glass, so making calls much more difficult than it should be.
You can't see, edit, or caption photos in Glass easily (only voice commands, which don't work in noisy situations like concerts). No way to automatically push photos from Glass to your smartphone, which would make it a LOT easier to edit, etc.
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter apps inadequate for really doing great posts.
No store, so getting apps very difficult.
Voice control of directions is usually good, but when it makes an error it is very hard to fix.
No live video streaming yet.
Battery life continues being too short, particularly when shooting video (I only get about 40 minutes when recording video).
Video compression is being done in software, not hardware, so unit gets hot, video isn't very high quality, and battery dies in 45 minutes or less.
Video only goes to a special part of Google+ (a new version of YouTube) and you can't easily push it to other places, like Vimeo, or your existing YouTube account.
The price is still at least twice as expensive as the most expensive smartphone and doesn't work without a smartphone. Until the price comes down I'll advise most people to stay away, especially given the lack of utility at the moment (and the risks that the UI and API's will dramatically shift this year).

There are other problems, as well, that keep it from being very useful. When I wrote the post below I thought Google would fix the problems quickly. I keep hoping fixes are coming.


++++++++++++++++++

I have had a Google Glass for two weeks now and they are VERY useful. Here's my review: My two-week review of Google Glass: it all depends on the?

Why? Well, just yesterday I was walking my kids around in a stroller. Both hands were on the stroller. Yet I was able to have New York Times articles read to me, I took a phone call (and made one to my wife), and I took a photo of the experience too.

This product is life changing. By the way, the Glass can NOT broadcast live to the world yet. You can shoot a video, have it uploaded to a private area on Google+, and only then can you move it over to public view from your smartphone or from inside the Glass itself.

After showing them to hundreds of people, I think the threats are mostly perception issues: if you walk into the wrong kind of bar, or a bathroom or gym locker room with them on, you might suffer consequences that won't be fun.

The big usefulness, though, is that these assist you living your life. When I got to the airport the other day it told me the gate and time of my flight. Very useful. Google Now also tells me other stuff, like how bad the traffic is on the way to work, etc. That's where the real functionality is.

Robert-Scoble-1,"Easy. Walk into any restaurant. Look at how many people are holding a mobile phone. Now consider that about a billion people are getting smartphones this year alone. Second, look at adoption rates of new things on laptops vs. mobile. Mobile is way higher. Third, look at numbers at some place like Facebook -- mobile is passing desktop usage.

I often sit next to people who use Windows PCs and I ask them ""show me something you've put on your computer that's new, loaded in the past couple of weeks."" Out of hundreds of people most can't answer that. Ask a mobile user the same thing and they'll take you on a tour of their apps ""oh, just got this Dots game, or check out the new Nest app I just got, etc etc.""

The tech press and investors care about where the market is going. Where is growth happening. Where are the most interesting, new, apps?

Robert-Scoble-1,"I get way more requests than I can take. Here's a few things I do:

1. I have an out-of-office message on Gmail that gives me the permission not to answer you (no answer is an ""automatic no"" the email says). Here's that email -- that lets me avoid being a jerk just by not replying:

++++++++++++++

Thank you for taking the time to write to me and I'm sorry if I don't get back to you.

I'm now getting emails at a level that I can't respond to everyone. This is an automatic response to an email you sent to scobleizer@gmail.com.

I will make a best attempt to get back to you, especially if you are sharing world-changing technology or if you are building contextual software or services, since I wrote a book with Shel Israel on that trend. Our book, ""Age of Context,"" has been released at Age of Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy eBook: Robert Scoble, Shel Israel: Kindle Store

I also am looking for best-of-breed tools to help people build companies on top of cloud infrastructure, due to my role at Rackspace.

I do read every email, but I only can reply to about 5%, sorry.

Unfortunately if I don't answer you within two or three days, it's the same as hearing ""no.""

To PR people, if you want me to cover your product you've got to give me more than one day warning.  I don't do press-release rewrites like other tech bloggers. It's best to get in touch with me at LEAST A MONTH before you launch.

If you are looking for more about where I'm publishing, or just want to have an informal chat, visit Robert Scoble | Facebook which has links to all of my blogs, and social media accounts.

Another way to get through is to talk with my producer, Rocky Barbanica. You can reach him at rocky@rackspace.com.

Thanks and sorry if I don't get back to you.

++++++++++++++

2. Have a philosophy. Mine is contextual computing is going to be more and more interesting. So, if you aren't contextual (mobile first) and using sensors, wearable computers, etc, then I will be less interested in you. This lets me say no in a nice way. ""Sorry, I'm looking for a specific kind of interaction in 2014 and you don't fit.""

3. Have a boss who makes you say no due to other interests. Boss's don't need to be employers, either. My kids and wife are in charge of my life too and demand my time the same as others do. ""My wife won't let me fit that speech into our calendar, sorry."" Or, ""my kids haven't seen me for a month so I can't make that dinner, sorry."" Works just as well as ""my boss at Rackspace already signed me up for another speech that evening, sorry.""

4. Know what you want out of life. I want to have more three-star Michelin-rated dinners. So, if you offer me one of those I'll find it very hard to turn down. I also want to see the next big company when it's just two entrepreneurs at a table. I find it hard to turn down a chance to see another company, particularly one that has an interesting new product coming out.

5. Try to be helpful in some other way. ""Hey, I can't do that interview you wanted me to do because I'm already booked this week, how about I introduce you to some other journalists who can help?""

6. Suggest ways to get to success. Those who are busy are very transactional. So, asking for coffee might get turned down, while asking to meet to pitch might not. Coffee implies some sort of squishy social agenda. ""I don't do coffee, but if you have a pitch please email me that."" Often they really just wanted to pitch you anyway and were trying to be nice by asking to buy you coffee.

7. If the person sounds interesting to at least meet, suggest meeting at an event ""hey, I'm about to head to CES in Vegas, will you be there or at SXSW in March?""

8. Be honestly busy. My calendar is 100% filled for January now. I'm very happy to show you my Google Calendar, which demonstrates that well. So, saying ""I'm booked until February and not booking new things"" works.

9. Ask them to go through someone who has an easier time saying no. For instance, I have a producer, Rocky Barbanica. He is far more willing to say no than I am. That said, if you convince him, it usually is because you actually have something great, so I'm more willing to put you on the calendar after you get through him.

10. Push them over to a social network. I do that because I want to be scalable in everything I do (answering a question on Quora, for instance, helps out potentially thousands of people, while answering a question in email only helps one person out). So, saying ""ask that question on Quora"" is a good way to turn down people. Smart people use Facebook to see when I'm online, too (I'll often chat with you there before answering my own email).

UPDATE: a friend, Loic Le Meur, turned down my request by saying simply ""I'll be on Necker Island then."" (That's the island that Richard Branson owns). I'll add that as #11: be doing something far cooler than what is being offered. :-)
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I would say that you should contact a tech journalist only AFTER you do this:

Know and follow at least 50 (I have a list of 600+ tech journalists on Twitter at Tech News People).
Make sure your startup might be interesting to the journalist in question.
Know why said tech journalist MIGHT cover you and HOW he/she might cover you (IE, have an interesting story). If I was trying to get into the New York Times, for instance, I'd read at least 500 articles written there first and I'd even start putting them into buckets. Know what bucket yours will go in.
Know how your startup is better than other companies already on the field.

Remember that, in my case, I only can accept about 1% of what gets pitched to me. I'm looking for companies who are pushing the future forward. That's vague, but not really. scobleizer@gmail.com is generally the best but phone can work too. +1-425-205-1921 -- know when I'm online and available, you can tell this from Facebook, in my case: https://www.facebook.com/RobertS...

Some tips?

Keep it short.
Explain why you are an example of how the future is changing.
Bring up anything that backs up your story (for instance, do you have a famous developer who already changed the world at, say, Apple?)
Make it easy to dive in. Do you have a blog? A video? A bunch of people talking about you on Twitter or Google+ or Facebook? A successful Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign?
Work hard on a great headline. Lots of us get 1,000 press releases a day. Think about how to stand out.
Get someone we trust to refer you. If Marc Andreessen emails me and says ""Scoble, you gotta see this new company"" you bet your bottom dollar I'll stop and pay attention.
ALWAYS carry your demo on your phone or iPad and be willing to show in weird places. Accidental PR is the best. I've found many of my favorite companies away from ""official PR.""
Be persistent, but not overbearing. Sometimes trying a second try when you have something new to announce works. I don't know why. It's just the luck of the draw. The difference between being persistent and being overbearing is a very thin line, though. Be good at listening to feedback.
If in a crowded market (photo sharing services, for instance) you better be 10x better and you better be able to demonstrate that in 30 seconds or less. Google was the 17th search engine but in just one search I was hooked and saw why it was better.

Some don'ts?

Don't mix social and business. If you want to just hang out with us and be our friend, that's OK, but don't try to ""buddy up"" just to get a chance to pitch me. Our social time is for socializing, not work.
Don't ask to pitch. The answer is ALWAYS no. Instead, ask something like ""I have a ground-breaking iPad app that is 10x better than Microsoft Office, what do you need to verify that what I'm telling you is true?""
Don't pitch us without looking at our Twitter and Facebook (even better if you use a tool like Nimble.com that shows you everything about us) . I have gotten a pitch right after I learned my mom was dying (I wrote about that online).
If you meet me in the street, don't try to pitch me unless you have some very unusual social proof (like if you are hanging out with Marc Andreessen and he verifies that what you are building is the best thing he's seen this year). I never remember these ""street"" pitches and they rarely are any good anyway. Instead, introduce yourself, and ask for our email so that you can pitch us professionally.
Don't pitch us on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Email is best for a whole lot of reasons (at least in my case). If you do pitch us there you'll get instructions to pitch us on email (mine is scobleizer@gmail.com ). I hate these social pitches because I can't easily search for them in the future and I often don't have time to answer everyone everywhere so focus on my email first.

Robert-Scoble-1,"I always want to be on the bleeding edge, or, more accurately use tools that are ""best of breed."" For the past seven years that was Apple's iPhone which is, still, arguably the best mobile ecosystem out there. Apps still ship on iPhone first (generally) and when I look at tech passionate people most of them still have iPhones and iPads.

That said, things are switching. Read Paul Stamatiou, designer at Twitter, about his experiences with Android: Android is better I agree with all his points.

My view started shifting last year when I saw a new series of trends that, bundled up, bring us contextual computing (I'm writing a book on those trends with Shel Israel, titled ""Age of Context"" that will come later this year).

Most of the apps in this new field are on Android first because of Android's more open approach. A great example is Everything.me - Introducing the Dynamic Phone TM, which is my favorite app switcher. It can change nearly everything about the phone and hook into all your apps, even. Things that are impossible for developers to do on iOS.

These new contextual apps, including Google Now, got me to look at Android in a new light. No longer was it an uglier cousin of iOS but was bringing very real innovation to bear.

Then, when Google Glass came out, my mind totally switched. I was  one of the first in line at last year's Google IO conference to lay down $1,500 for my own Google Glass (I've been wearing them every day since April 16, 2013).

Google Glass is a real game changer. No other consumer electronics device knows where I'm aimed, where I'm looking, and has such a consistent access to my context through the sensors inside.

Of course it works better with Android (it runs Android 4.0.4 inside). So that pushed me to make the switch.

Later, Moto X showed me that there's yet again, more innovation coming on the Android side of the fence (you can't talk to your iPhone without touching it first), but on Moto X it just listens for you to say ""OK Google Now."" Since it is illegal to touch a phone while driving, both Glass and Moto X are big deals for me since I drive 1.5 hours every day to the Rackspace Studio in San Francisco and back.

That all said, I still have an iPad and am watching the Apple ecosystem closely. Most users won't follow me, there aren't enough advantages -- yet. But with Paul's note, and my observations, there is something happening on the Android side of the fence and I think it'll become more obvious next year that Android has taken the innovation crown away from Apple (and everyone else).

Robert-Scoble-1,"It's expensive because the ones that are being distributed now are prototypes that are being built one-by-one.

I expect that when they are released to the public next year they will be somewhere around $200 to $300. The build-of-materials is somewhere around $100, when you look at all the components. Of course that doesn't cover the millions of dollars spent in R&D and in acquiring people, like Thad Starner, to come and build them.

Some reasons they are so expensive (this isn't the first time a company has charged a lot for developer prototypes -- the Xbox prototypes were about the same price):

Supply and demand. They can only make a few hundred per week at this point. So, having a low price wouldn't make sense. When you have very little supply and a lot of demand, raising the price is perfectly reasonable.
Making sure that the best people get them first. If I were Google I'd want mostly developers to have them at this point so that there'd be some apps when they are released early in 2014. Developers see the value in building companies and products to target a new platform. Paying $1,500 to build something like Instagram won't seem significant in three years if the business is successful. Most other people won't see the value in paying $1,500 for an unproven new gadget.
PR reasons. If you spend $1,500 for a pre-release prototype you know what you are getting into. You'll likely give a lot of feedback to Google. You'll likely understand the limitations (there are MANY app holes right now, for instance) and forgive those. Regular people, if they got them at this point, wouldn't understand those limitations and would complain about them on Twitter and Facebook, etc.
Anyway, I think this is a short term problem. By May most people will be able to buy them and I can't see a reason that Google would charge more than $500 for them (and I can see many that they would want to make them very low cost, like $200).

Robert-Scoble-1,"I work for Rackspace and have for 4.5 years.

It is the best-run company I have ever worked for in my 48 years of life.

It is also very well positioned for the next Contextual Age of business (where sensors, wearable computers, mobile devices, along with social and location data, are going to totally change how businesses work with customers and each other).

Why?

Out of all the companies mentioned only Rackspace is built on open source cloud technology. That means we'll be able to do more things, and not lock our customers in, like the others do.

For instance, can you run AWS on your own datacenters? Or on your own machine on your desk? No. But with OpenStack you can (OpenStack is a fully open source foundation, so you can innovate without waiting for someone else to do it).

Look at it another way. With Rackspace you are safe to move to another provider built on top of OpenStack. Can you say the same about the others? No. You are locked in.

Add in the fanatical support that Mark talks about, and I'm quite optimistic about the future of Rackspace.

Why would you bet against open source? Do you like having to wait for big companies to innovate? Do you like being locked in? Do you like not having the choice of where to run your cloud?

Robert-Scoble-1,"Most of the time? Nothing.

But IF (big if) you all are on the ""OK Glass"" screen, then it'll listen to the first voice it hears. So, one person is able to, say, shoot a picture on everyone's Glass if they yell ""OK Glass, Take a Picture.""

Now, in real world? If someone did that around me I'd instantly turn my Glass off by pulling down on the touch surface.

Also, if you try something funnier like ""Send a message"" it won't work unless you know which of the 10 people I've added to the contact list on Glass. Also, like I said, if you try to do something funny I'll just turn it off before it has a chance to send a message to someone.

It makes for great headlines, but you really think anyone out there won't buy this because I took a photo with it in the shower? If anything, that sold more Google Glass because it demonstrates very effectively that it survives in rainstorms. It also shows that those of us who have it can laugh at ourselves and not take life SO damn seriously!

Tracy-Chou,"I set up a Github project at triketora/women-in-software-eng to crowdsource data on this subject (the data populates this spreadsheet, from which Ri Liu has built this visualization). As of April 2014, data from 149 companies has been submitted, for a total of 4700+ engineers counted. Overall, the percentage of female engineers in this data set is somewhere between 12 and 13%.

To answer the question, then:

The companies that have 1 out of 1 or 2 out of 2 female engineers technically have the highest percentages, but these are small numbers and very unstable. They just need to hire one or two men for their percentages to plummet. There's a lot of noise at the small company side of the spectrum.

At scale, the numbers start to reflect the underlying lack of diversity in tech, and it is harder to maintain higher percentages. Only counting companies with 50+ total engineers, the percentage of female engineers in the sample drops from 12.7% to 10.5%. In this set of companies, the ones that have above-average representation of female engineers are New Relic (19.87%), Rhapsody (18.42%), SurveyMonkey (17.31%), Guideware Software (17.21%), Practice Fusion (16.67%), Rdio (16.07%), Pinterest (14.39%), Quantcast (13.39%), Airbnb (13.16%), and Etsy (12.75%).

Note: People quibble quite a bit about who is considered an engineer or developer. I've gotten some flak about not counting some types of technical work as engineering (e.g. sysadmin, CSS), but the line has to be drawn somewhere. Any question like this is hard to answer ""accurately"" and to everyone's satisfaction.

Tracy-Chou,"Pinterest is a great place to work, full stop; but there are also many reasons to recommend it as a place to work as a front-end engineer:

The web product is what put Pinterest on the map and, even with the advent of mobile, is still critically important to the company as one of the major touch points with Pinners and partners. The work of front-end engineers at Pinterest is valued and has high impact.

pinterest.com is a hefty piece of engineering. We are no longer just building a website; we are building a full-featured web application, and there is a lot of complexity in that. At the platform level, we've developed a new web framework with modularity and reusability as first-class design principles, and built to consume the Pinterest API like any other client. We're still extending that framework (and the core abstractions on it), making it more powerful, performant, and easy to develop on. And of course the product itself is just really fun to build out -- features like place boards and place Pins require some pretty awesome front-end wrangling:

http://www.pinterest.com/triketora/tech-offices/

A strong company culture of ""knitting"" means product design and front-end engineers work very closely together to develop the user-facing product. And our designers are truly world-class and forward-thinking: the proliferation of the Pinterest grid layout across the modern web is just one indication of how we're pushing the field towards new standards. It's quite a privilege to work with such creative thinkers, and we really do work together. Designs aren't just set and tossed over a wall for implementation; engineers are also big stakeholders in ""putting pinners first"" (our #1 company value) and work hard to make the user experience great.

The team is phenomenal: deeply talented, with complementary strengths and backgrounds, and a dedication to collaboration and mentorship. I joined the web team at Pinterest with virtually no prior experience in web development; I couldn't have found a better team to bring me up to speed. Every pull request I submitted, I'd tag @Pinterest/web, and I'd get really helpful and insightful feedback on everything from alternate implementations with an analysis of tradeoffs, browser performance considerations, JS and CSS best practices, etc.

For those interested in exploring more full-stack work, there is also the opportunity to join full-stack product teams, doing front-end engineering for particular features but also delving into other/new technical domains. A couple of web team alums, myself included, have moved onto such teams, while retaining close ties to the web team.

The semantic relationship of the name ""Heartbleed"" to the bug is that the bug lies in the TLS protocol ""heartbeat"" mechanism, used to assure a machine that its peer is still alive and available on the network, and the bug ""bleeds"" data.

Plus, one of our first key architectural decisions was to split out a database service to handle all reads/writes to MySQL, which if repeated would make the database management abstractions in the choice of web framework much less of a consideration.

For what it's worth, we hardly use Django for much in our web stack now, besides the middleware (authentication, logging, etc.). Aside from migrating off the ORM years ago, we've written our own routing and generally don't use handlers in the Django pattern. So it hasn't really passed the test of time and a growing codebase and engineering team.

Furthermore, it's not merely a disadvantage in terms of time expended; it is also a significant scheduling constraint.

Tracy-Chou,"At 13 years old, boys and girls have already been exposed to 13 years of socialization encouraging in boys and discouraging in girls an interest in computers.


Unlocking the Clubhouse[1] has by far the best treatment of this topic that I've seen in the literature -- the authors conducted over 230 interviews with over 100 male and female computer science students at Carnegie Mellon from 1995 to 1999, weaving together quantitative and qualitative data to construct a picture of this ever leaky pipeline of women in computing, and the STEM fields generally.

(By way of brief summary of relevant research from that book, any mis-interpretations or mis-representations my own: ) From childhood, there's plenty going on in the home to perpetuate this gender divide. It's not just the types of toys that parents choose for their children, sometimes reflecting parental projections of their children's preferences more so than their actual preferences. There's also generationally-inherited gender bias when dad/son time and mom/daughter time reflect what dad and mom, respectively, like to do. And gender norms established when dad tinkers on the computer and mom is content to be ""computer illiterate""; when the family computer is placed not in the daughter's room but in the son's room, with the implicit ownership that that implies; when girls are held back from wandering  or exploring too far physically or metaphorically.

In the classroom and in social settings, boys and girls quickly learn which activities and spaces are male-appropriate and which are female-appropriate. Playing with computers and hanging out in the computer lab fall squarely on the male side of that dividing line.


The marketing machine of modern capitalism contributes handily to these social expectations as well. For example, gaming is often tipped as a gateway activity to computing, and it's a heavily gendered one -- thanks to marketing. After a big crash in the video game industry in the 1980s, the industry tightened and refocused its marketing efforts to target boys and young men. The message became ""No girls allowed"", because it was deemed a more successful market strategy, and it's become a self-fulfilling prophecy.[2]

Broadening our perspective to other building blocks of pop culture, movies like The Social Network and TV shows like ""Big Bang Theory"" (both of which, incidentally, fail the Bechdel test spectacularly) don't help much either. They glorify and build up the mythology of the anti-social white male nerd, further removing the domains of math and science and engineering from the fathomable futures of young women. To quote the authors of a study linking the mere presence of geek paraphernalia in a room to reduced female interest in computer science: ""Environments can act like gatekeepers by preventing people who do not feel they fit into those environments from ever considering membership in the associated groups.""[3]


So that's why it's hard to imagine getting 13 year old girls interested in computers: because, by 13, girls have already been socialized to not be interested in computers.

Tracy-Chou,"I hesitate to counsel definitively one way or the other, but my gut says you should stick with your computer science studies if you enjoy the subject matter. It's true that the social elements and feeling of belonging are important and I wouldn't dismiss those considerations out of hand, but I suspect that you'll be able to find your place and a network of friends with time and a little effort. And once you do, it'll be worth it.

I'm happily employed as a software engineer now and I'm so thankful for all the twists and turns that have taken me to where I am now -- it's a great career path, well-compensated, very flexible; the work is intellectually interesting, creative, collaborative, impactful and relevant to society.

But it was not clear to me that I wanted to be a software engineer until I actually took my first job as one, and even a year into that I was still doubtful of my choice. In college, I chose to not major in computer science because I was intimidated by my (mostly male) classmates and didn't feel like I belonged. (More on that here.) I eventually did a master's in CS, pressured by a good friend who knew better than I did what was good for me, but even after that I wasn't particularly committed to CS / software. Amongst other things, I applied to business schools for marketing PhD programs, and for industry roles that I was evaluating at that time, I was poking around at data analyst / data science positions and not engineering. I was finally convinced that I should give software engineering an earnest try, and so I did. But it wasn't easy, and I did feel lonely and out-of-place for a long time. (More on that here.) There were certainly a lot of heart-to-hearts with friends in and out of the industry, and many tears involved. I questioned many times whether I had the mental fortitude to be a female software engineer, and I questioned whether I could encourage younger women to go into the field when I myself could barely keep it together.

It got better when I found one close friend at work, another female software engineer, and I realized I wasn't alone. Some people reached out to me, and I reached out to some other people, and I found more kindred souls. It helped too that I got a lot more involved with the community, connecting with people on Twitter, meeting people 1:1, volunteering with mentorship programs, generally being present at events and meetups.

When I switched jobs, it was a natural reset and I made a conscious effort to invest in my social network outside of work. That was actually entirely sufficient for my mental health and happiness to have friends outside of work, but as the company grew and more people joined I also became good friends with a number of coworkers. If you just imagine that you'll jive with some percentage of the population that has similar interests and/or is compatible values- and personality-wise with you, and you increase the total number of people that you encounter or interact with, the number of people that you'll click with also increases.

You'll find friends, and it won't be so lonely :) Don't give up on something that you love and that is a great professional opportunity, too.

Tracy-Chou,"The 2013 Nike Women's (half-) Marathon was my first real* race so my views on it are perhaps tinged more positively for the excitement around that personal achievement -- but I really enjoyed it and was not put off by the stereotypical female trappings of the event. The overarching consideration and redeeming quality for me is that it gets people like me out there and running.

What was the draw of the NWM in particular? I have to admit the Tiffany's necklace was an easy selling point; I like pretty things and I would actually wear a Tiffany's necklace whereas most organization- or event-based paraphernalia typically comes in the form of very unstylish free t-shirts that are acceptable attire only as sleepwear. I certainly joked a number of times that I was doing the race for the necklace, but in truth that was just a quick, lighthearted answer that was easier to give than explaining that this felt like a good race to get started on because it's a big, well-organized event that's very accessible to new runners, and I felt almost-ready and anxious to do a ""real race"" but needed the security and support of (what the marketing literature refers to as) a tribe, even a tribe constructed by a capitalist institution to build their brand and promote materialism and consumerism.

As for the makeup wipes, chocolate, pedicures, etc., they were hardly a highlight of the race at all; just little extras along the way and at the end. Every race has different sponsors that try to target the demographic of the participants. It didn't feel so much like women need additional support to get through the race as that all these events are commercialized. Neither was the race particularly empowering, I felt, because while it's ostensibly celebrating women's athletic achievements, ultimately as a runner I just cared that I had 13.1 miles to cover and it was thrilling to be on the course and running.

Tracy-Chou,"That's very much not true. Most of our engineering team does not have frontend experience.
  "
Tracy-Chou,"When I was making a similar decision in 2010, deciding between Facebook (~1500 employees, pre-IPO) and Quora (total company headcount of 4, pre-funding), these were the factors I considered:

1. learning opportunities (this was by far the most important point in my decision framework)

1a. in the technical realm

There is more structure around onboarding and engineering process at a larger company. For example, Google has an engEDU group which has tutorials and talks and other great resources for you to pick up new engineering knowledge; Facebook puts you through Bootcamp for your first six weeks, there are mobile development classes if you want to transition into that, etc.

However, in your main job you're likely to stay on a specific team for a while, focused on a very specific problem, where everything else has been abstracted away or otherwise taken care of for you already. You might go deep in that one problem, but you're less likely to see the full stack or range of engineering problems that the company is working on.

At a small company, you can (and may be forced to) bounce around projects, products, technologies, and teams a lot more, and you'll quickly acquire a breadth of knowledge that way. For example, in my 2 years at Pinterest I've worked on a re-architecture of our codebase; a database migration; memcache and redis caching abstractions; API endpoints and security; our email framework -- templates, logic, and infrastructure; feed quality and infrastructure; new user retention data analysis; performance debugging tools; our in-house web framework and rewrite of the website; the mobile website; amongst other things. Earlier this year I switched from backend to frontend work and got to pick up an entirely new set of skills. It's hard to imagine this amount of flexibility at a larger company.

As we build out the team we are starting to invest in onboarding materials and presentations so those are coming along nicely as well, but they won't be as fleshed out as Google's or Facebook's for a long while yet.

It's important that you know your own learning style and what you're looking to learn when you consider which opportunities are better for learning.

1b. learning about everything else / learning about startups

If you ever want to start your own company, joining a startup and absorbing all that's going on around you is one of the best things you can do to set yourself up for success. When teams are small, you're exposed to a lot more of the company; you'll see how to make product decisions and design processes for making product decisions, how to build and grow teams, how to work with customers, how to steer with data vs. intuition, how to evaluate fundraising opportunities and timelines, and so much more. These are all things you're unlikely to see very closely in a big company.

1c. mentorship

In terms of mentorship, the big companies can boast some famous people but they're not necessarily committed to the same projects and goals that you are, which means the mentorship may be less contextual and not as useful. Sheryl Sandberg offered to mentor me personally at Facebook but ultimately I figured that joining a smaller company where I was working directly with great people it would be a lot more meaningful of a learning opportunity. Pinterest has lots of really stellar folks that you will just be working side-by-side with; we have a relatively senior team in terms of work experience and there's a great culture of helping each other learn and grow.

1d. riding the rocket ship (this point wasn't applicable to me in 2010 when I was evaluating Quora, since it was so early stage, but I think it's applicable now for Pinterest)

Speaking of Sheryl, this quote of hers is a great one: ""If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on; don't ask what seat."" Pinterest is poised for fast growth; we've already 20x'd our team headcount in about 2 years and we're still growing fast. We're just starting our monetization efforts and there will be a lot to do and build and learn as we not only make Pinterest a useful service for more and more people all around the world, but also turn it into a viable business. It'll be a fun ride.

2. building a network

One big point in favor of Google and Facebook is that they've amassed a lot of talented people on their campuses. Many of these people will move on to other companies and other great opportunities in the future and being connected to them will be very valuable.

The team at Pinterest is of extremely high caliber (germane to a comparison with Google and Facebook, many are ex-Google and ex-Facebook) and you'll get to know people much better, but the sheer number of people that you will add to your network from working at Pinterest is probably much smaller.

The people in your network may expose you to job opportunities, they may be your future co-founders, they may be good recruits to teams you're on later, they may be future clients or help facilitate introductions to clients, or they may simply share useful insights or be good friends.

3. financial returns

I like to think of the value of any potential options as 0 because I am conservative and don't like to be disappointed by unrealistically high expectations. (Compensation in terms of salary is pretty reasonable in any case: across the board pretty high, enough to live comfortably on and save some away, so even with equity being worth 0 you're in good shape.)

With that caveat, Pinterest has a lot of potential upside.

To contextualize with some numbers, in the latest round of funding investors put Pinterest's valuation at $3.8B; Google's market cap is $340B (October 2013). The comparison isn't totally nutty as there is a lot of commercial intent on Pinterest and a lot of demand amongst advertisers to capitalize on that intent. The reason why Google AdWords is so phenomenally successful is that search intent tends to be commercial and there's money there. So the hope is that that piece will work out similarly for Pinterest in display advertising, which nobody has really done well up to this point; but Pinterest is also a social site that people enjoy spending time on (as opposed to get in, get out with Google or Amazon) and use to discover content, so there's some secret sauce.

Obviously, the challenge for Pinterest is to execute on the potential.

4. work/life balance (I didn't consider this point much when I first graduated but now appreciate it deeply)

At all of these three companies -- Google, Facebook, and Pinterest -- you can work long hours, or you can set a very reasonable fixed schedule for yourself. It does depend on your team and your deadlines (I imagine Android to have more intense crunch times around big releases, for example; web software generally is on looser timelines for releases) but you can definitely find something that works for you.

At Pinterest, my hours are something like 9am to 6pm M-F, with occasional code reviews or emails after hours. There are people who are in the office for fewer hours, particularly those who have long commutes; there are people who are in the office for a lot more hours. I've settled on my current schedule because it's what works best for me given all the things I want to do outside of work; for example, I've picked up running and yoga in the past year and I run ~4 times a week and do yoga ~3 times a week. Being active keeps me healthy and happy, plus yoga is a moving meditation that helps me to reset; ensuring that I have life outside of work makes me more productive at work, too.

5. culture fit

You'll be spending more time with your coworkers than anybody else in your life, more than with your friends and possibly even more than with your significant other. Make sure you're ok with that. Definitely within larger companies like Google and Facebook and to some extent within Pinterest too, there's too much variance team by team to give any sort of useful commentary on the culture here; just make sure you have a good sense of what you're signing up for.


At Pinterest I think we really do have a crack at becoming the next Google or Facebook, and I think it's much more exciting to help build the next big thing than just to join the already big thing. But you can't really go wrong whatever you decide -- and this decision is highly reversible :)

Having just bought a vacation home in Sonoma (specifically the Agua Caliente neighborhood), I can strongly recommend looking there.  For similar reasons others mentioned, the main positives are:

Variety of travel options to/from
It typically takes less than 1 hour to get to Sonoma from the Golden Gate Bridge and is easily accessible from East Bay.  From Palo Alto, I get to my house in 1hr 40 min on average.  Plus, it's nice to stop in SF or Marin County on the way if I need to run errands or see friends.  Google Maps traffic helps me avoid tough spots on 101 or 280 and find a better alternative route.

Incredible value
I got a beautiful 3,000+ square foot modern home built only 5 years ago for the equivalent of what 1,500 sq ft average condo would cost in SF or really anywhere in the Peninsula.  Using Trulia as of 9/25/13, I compiled a look at $/square foot as one data point for comparison:
-Sonoma = $372
-Palo Alto = $1,000
-San Francisco = $727
-Berkeley = $505
-Carmel = $1,378
-Santa Cruz = $461
-Stinson Beach = $976

Peaceful getaway with urban conveniences
There are a number of vacationers up in Sonoma and it is still an agricultural economy (with some tourism) so the vibe is pretty peaceful.  You can see the stars at night and hear the crickets.  There are a few higher end hotels that offer spa services and you can find anything you need within a 10 minute drive of most anywhere.

Awesome food
Not only are there a lot of grocery stores in Sonoma proper (Whole Foods, Sonoma Market, Safeway, Lucky, mom & pop markets), there are also many award winning restaurants like Girl & the Fig, El Dorado Kitchen, and my favorite - El Molino.  Glen Ellen Star is incredible and quite close.  You are also 30-40 minutes from Bouchon, French Laundry, and other restaurant meccas.  Additionally, there are farmers markets going on in Sonoma or some town nearby every day of the week and the local produce is delicious.

Easily rentable/giftable
Summer and fall are very popular for weddings and harvest events in the area.  It would be quite easy to rent out your home or gift it to friends/family who have events in the area.

Fun for friends to visit
One of my main considerations in buying a vacation home was that I wanted to share it with friends and family.  I wanted to get a place somewhere that when I told a friend, they'd say, ""Oh I'd LOVE to visit!""  This is why Sonoma topped Santa Cruz, Tahoe, Mill Valley, Carmel, and other places for me.  While they are nice places, my friends tend to visit those less frequently and have less enthusiasm to travel there.  Most everyone I know is excited to come to wine country for the weekend.

Enjoy!

Sarah-Smith,"Yes, it is possible to change functions.

One of our values at Quora is to continuously learn and adapt.  Not only do we do this as an organization, but also as individuals.

Coming to Quora, I changed functions.  As a manager at Quora and at Facebook, I've helped a number people change functions within tech and have developed some principles and points to consider related to this type of career progression:

1. Hold yourself to a high standard.  You are not a ""shoo-in"" just because you already know people at the company.
If you consider interviewing internally for another function, you should hold yourself accountable to do the same preparation as an external candidate.  This would likely mean hours of preparation studying the function and perhaps weeks or months developing the competency required.  Because you may know people in the function, it would be easy for people to assume that you got the role because you ""know"" people.  Given that, I always aim to leave no doubt that I would be more than qualified for the role and take the interviews very seriously.

2. The role and function should be essential to the company.
If you are interested in changing functions, you should first survey the greatest needs and gaps at the company and see if you potentially fit into one of those areas.  It's important to remember that the company needs should be your focus as that is where you'll have the greatest impact.  I've seen some people early in their career focus too much on going after the ""sexy"" team or title but lose sight of what's really critical for the company's success. 

3.  Work hard, execute efficiently, play well with others and people will approach you before you have time to start looking for a new function.
In my experience, people who dig in, work hard, roll up their sleeves, do the least glamorous work, and produce results will find other functions coming around trying to recruit them before they've even had time to start thinking about switching teams.  The best people who work hard and effectively with their team and across the company, are usually sought out for new roles.  When I see someone on my team humbly working hard and producing results, I want to retain them at the company as long as possible and so will often start early conversations about what could be next for them as I can imagine them having impact in a lot of areas because of their work ethic.  Conversely, if someone is not meeting expectations or showing poor work ethic, I'd be very reluctant to recommend they seek out other teams and would not give an internal endorsement.

Finally, as a rule of thumb, I think everyone should spend at least a year or more in their function before they make a major change.  It's only fair to contribute back to your team given the amount of time they invest in training and mentoring you at the beginning.  Given that, I discourage people from starting in any role at the company with the intention of it only being a ""stepping stone"" into something else.  You should pursue roles and functions that you are genuinely excited to learn and that allow you to focus on your overall impact to the team and the company.

Sarah-Smith,"Some, but very very little.

I'm a bit older than people initially think when we meet. I didn't get an email address until I went to college in 1995.  Math had always been my favorite subject in school and I adored puzzles and games (still do).  That may be why I decided to create my own small personal website in 1997 using the University of Wisconsin's comp sci department servers.  Back then, any interested student could get some space and using a simple FTP program, could continually update HTML files and upload images.  The internet was just getting going so it felt like magic to have a page with my name and content on it!

So basically I taught myself some HTML and got about as far as creating some tables, customizing layouts, and linking to multiple pages of content including scans of my drawings.  I remember entering background and text color codes for hours choosing between CCFF00 and 99BBEE or something of that sort.  What magic to test out different color schemes!

My only other foray into ""coding"" would have been studying to pass out of excel modeling at Stanford GSB.  I'd never done modeling before but some wise student from the year ahead of me told me it was basic linear algebra and that with the textbook and some sample tests, I could probably cram and study for the exemption exam.  While I'm glad I managed to get out of the class, I do wish I had gotten some more formal coding classes at some point.

I keep telling myself that I'll eventually teach myself more coding but in the meantime, I'm pretty busy finding others who are very very good at coding to come join us at Quora.

Sarah-Smith,"There are a number of strategies to pursue.  I'm going to outline a few ideas to consider when forming your starting strategy (not taking into account which placement order you get):

Number diversity strategy
Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game.  The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability.  If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible.  Ideally you would avoid being on a number twice and would expand such that your first settlement gains you two more numbers like 3 and 11 given the example above.

Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand.  If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements.

Corner scarce resources strategy
Depending on where the numbers land, it is always good to take a scan of which resources will be the most scarce in the game.  Brick and rock only have 3 tiles on the board whereas others have 4 so they are usually the best candidates.  However, if you see that wood only has one strong number and three very weak numbers, then you may want to corner out that strong number on wood, bolstering your trading power in the game.

Abundant resources port strategy
As a counter to the scarce resource strategy, you can also try to determine where there will be an abundance of resources based on which resource has the highest combined probability numbers and put one of your first two settlements on the trading port for that resource.  Opponents who aren't paying attention may trade you two sheep for a rock because they have an overage of sheep, forgetting that you are sitting on a sheep port and can now trade for any resource you need in your next turn.

Tip: Carefully consider initial road placement
Amateur players often think very little about which way to point their first roads.  You will quickly learn that pointing a road directly to a dead end or another opponent's settlement is very costly.  Make sure you point your road toward an area you want to expand that also is likely to be open after all the initial settlements have been laid.  I generally think it's a bad idea to ""fight it out"" for a settlement spot when two people have their roads pointed toward the same place.  If you lose that first battle, there's a very high chance you'll lose the whole game.  You should bluff and threaten to build in that direction but don't actually waste valuable cards on it unless you've got 80-90% confidence you can pull it off.

Have fun!

Sarah-Smith,"It's a smart move.

Background: I grew up outside Milwaukee and went to the University of Wisconsin for undergrad.  Upon graduation, I worked briefly in Madison as an elementary music teacher.  In 2001, I moved to the Bay Area and looking back, I'm confident it was the smartest move I could have made (although I didn't know it at the time.)

Immediate differences you'll notice:

No seasons.  It took a couple years for me to get used to having no winter.  It's lovely to not have to shovel snow off your car but I remember thinking, ""How do people know that time has passed here?  It's like one looooong year.""

Housing is expensive.  In 2000 in Madison, I was paying $700/month for rent sharing a nice 2BR apartment.  My first 2BR in Oakland was $1250 and that was low for the area.  I'm sure even at that time that rent was double in SF ($2500).  I just purchased a home for ~$1M and never thought coming from the midwest that I'd ever do such a thing.

It's more acceptable to ""flake"" in CA.  I remember being shocked at how people would cancel meetings at the last minute.  Growing up in Wisconsin, cancelling in itself is a big deal but I would never dream to cancel anything less than a week in advance.  In CA, it's pretty common and acceptable for people to decide at the last minute not to attend a party or dinner they committed to attending.

People are smart and more worldly.  San Francisco and San Jose are always ranked in the top 10 most educated cities in the U.S. and you can feel it.  The average education level is just much higher here than in the rest of the U.S.  Also, most people are like you in that they came to the Bay Area for education or opportunity so it is a melting pot of people from all over the world....much more diverse than the midwest generally.

Extraordinary career opportunity. As for your career, I think moving to the Bay Area is the best move you could make for your field.  You could go into finance on the east coast but working in tech, especially on consumer web products, is thrilling.  I believe data science is getting as or more competitive than software engineering given the increasing amounts of data to crunch and testing required to be successful on web/mobile. 

Pack your bags and head out.  Just bring some extra rent money and leave your snow pants at home!

Sarah-Smith,"It's awesome.

I would argue that getting your degree at Wisconsin is one of the best decisions you could make to get the most of a college experience for the least cost.  I attended from 1995-2000 so surely things have changed but I'll outline some of the common themes that I think were there before I attended and persist today:

1. People are really nice.
You're in Wisconsin.  People are just nice there.  It's easy to make friends.  The dorms like Witte, Sellery, Chadbourne all hold upwards of 1,000 students so there's a huge concentration of students around to you meet and learn from.

2. Madison has the best of a big city at a much smaller size.
Just walk down State Street and you'll find a ton of shops, really good bars, restaurants, and even street performers.  Madison does very well from an entertainment standpoint as there is always something to do. 

3.  Parties, parties, and more parties.
I actually didn't drink much until I was 21 (somehow the campus police presos actually scared me) but there are plenty of house parties and bars.  Wisconsin has earned a reputation as #1 party school a number of years. Top Party Schools and Colleges for 2011, 2012 and 2013

4. Big 10 Football.
Camp Randall (UWBadgers.com - The Official Web Site of the Wisconsin Badgers - Facilities), built in 1917, holds over 80K fans.  Wisconsin has been in the Rose Bowl a number of times in the last 10 years and has traditionally had a very strong football team.  Additionally Ohio State, Northwestern, Michigan, and others in the Big 10 have great teams.  EVERYONE goes to the game.  It's a sea of red and the Wisconsin Marching Band is an institution, hosting their famous ""5th Quarter"". 

5. Stellar faculty.
Various departments are often ranked in the top 10 for public universities and often on par with Ivy League schools.  In particular, the education, communications, engineering, medical, law, and business schools are continually ranked among top programs.  Wisconsin is also a research university affording you the chance to do research as an undergrad (great preparation for grad school applications).

6. Politically exciting place to be.
Because Madison is the state capital, politics is always ""in the air"".  In addition, Wisconsin is a swing state so you'll find very opinionated Democrats and Republicans everywhere.  Political debate among Wisconsinites is common and respectful.

7. Beautiful outdoors.....but it gets cold.
The campus is situated between two lakes: Lake Mendota and Lake Menona.  Both offer fantastic lake shore trails for running and sailing in the summers.  Be prepared though to brave long, tough winters hiking up Bascom hill with sleet in your face and temperatures below zero.

8.  Memorial Union.
""The Union"", Memorial Union, is an architecturally beauty that, when opened in 1928, the president of the university said, ""The Union is a living room, which converts the University from a house of learning into a home of learning.?  It's a social center and the Rathskeller serves beer all year round including summers on the terrace when live bands play in front of the lakefront most nights.

9. Freedom to explore.
Because Wisconsin is such a big school, there are over 4,000 courses to choose from along with hundreds of clubs and extracurricular opportunities.  You will be able to find someone else interested in what you want to learn about or explore, even if it is a niche topic or activity. 

10.  100,000+ alums around the world.
Among the famous people who have attended Wisconsin are former Vice President Dick Cheney, renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly, author Joyce Carol Oates, aviator Charles Lindbergh, naturalist John Muir, and architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  Badger alums are super friendly and get together all over the world to watch football games and other athletic events.  When I moved to Austin, TX knowing no one, Wisconsin alums became some of my first friends!

Overall, I can't recommend Wisconsin enough.  It's an incredible experience.

(A fellow alum Erin Hubbard and me at the Rose Bowl in 2013. Go Badgers!)

Sarah-Smith,"I manage the HR and Recruiting teams at Quora. Nadia Singer, Katie Nguyen, Tenzing Bhutia and I sit and work together in the official ""recruiting pod"" at Quora and love what we're building. 

To answer your other questions, we no longer use Jobvite but instead power our careers page and applications via Lever.  We evaluate how the overall application (cover letter, resume, in some cases portfolio) matches with the position requirements.  In short though, we do review all applications.

Yes!  We have had a number of our employees hired after applying on our Careers Page here: http://www.quora.com/careers).  Applying via our site is a great way to reach a recruiter at Quora.

Sarah-Smith,"This really depends on what you are selling.  For standard, secondhand things from the house, I would recommend actually taking your things and selling them at a flea market for one day.  For collectible items, selling online will likely get you the most profit.

Here are some advantages and disadvantages of each method:

Selling Online
Pros
More buyers overall
Higher likelihood of a match for a nitch collectables
Fun to post and watch an auction or sell via ""Buy It Now"" at a higher price

Cons
Shipping items is a lot of work, especially if the items are fragile
Shipping costs often make total price too high for regular items
Some buyers can claim item is of different condition than you described and refund/return process can be a pain
Creating listings with good pictures can take a lot of time

Actual Costs
Etsy charges $.20/listing plus 3.5% of the sale price (see Etsy - Help)
eBay charges 10% of the final price (see Standard selling fees)

Flea Market
Pros
Big market with other sellers means more foot traffic than a garage sale
No marketing costs
Usually have a Goodwill truck onsite so you can unload unsold wares at end of day

Cons
You don't set the date/hours and have to stay with your stand all day
Lots of haggling with customers

Actual Costs
Flea market fees vary widely from $10 - $100/day depending on the size and popularity.  Some allow you to sell once and some require multiple day commitments.  Some also require a state seller license.

Garage Sale
Pros
Convenient time/place/location as you set it!
Easy to add more stuff if you forgot something in your house

Cons
Hard to get foot traffic
""Early bird"" requests, avid rummagers will call/write wanted first look before others

Actual Costs
Advertising on Craigslist or your local newspaper could cost $50-$100
Signs around the neighborhood cost $20-$30

Good luck!
  "
Sarah-Smith,"The treasure hunt and the history lessons.

Most people go to flea markets because they collect something: old dolls, war memorabilia, vintage advertising signs, antique clocks, midcentury dishware, etc.

I personally go because I find objects at a flea market to be windows into the past.  It's fascinating to pick up an old bottle or tin and think about where it came from, who used it, how much is it worth now?  Sometimes if you are lucky, the vendor will have an interesting story for you. 

Besides the look to the past, I also collect vintage dishware and glassware: Fiestaware, Heath, Russel Wright, Pyrex, and so on.  Here's a pic of most of my Fiestaware collection:

Mike-Rundle,"If you've boiled down your decision to a shoot-out between Sproutcore or Cappuccino, I don't think you can go wrong with either one.

If you're trying to figure out the difference between the two, it's fairly simple: you write Cappuccino apps using Objective-J, an Objective-C-like syntax built on top of Javascript that's extremely similar to Objective-C. If you know Objective-C and Cocoa APIs already you'll feel right at home. So much so that it'll feel like you're literally writing a desktop Mac app or iPhone app.

Sproutcore, on the other hand, gives you the benefits of many design patterns in Cocoa but you're not writing a new language, you're still using Javascript and your code still looks like Javascript. A Javascript developer will need serious hand-holding and learning time to pick-up Cappuccino whereas they already know the language if they want to build a Sproutcore app.

Esther-Dyson,"Yes, it was bogus, thanks.  Just a cheapskate trying to get a cheap longstay ticket...and pretending it was some obscure govt reg!
  "
Esther-Dyson,"Personally, I don't think so.  here's what I said at www.orject-syndicate.org:

Americans are great believers in the value of entrepreneurs and small business. That faith underlies the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act, a new law that will make it easier for small companies to raise money and bypass the regulatory ?friction? that firms encounter when they go public. The law assumes that people who can't find jobs may be able to find investors instead, and that small companies will be able to get the financing they need to grow bigger and hire more people. Angel investors, friends, and family will boldly go where banks may fear to tread.
 
The JOBS Act is an extreme example of Americans? belief in people?s essential goodness, and everyone?s right to self-fulfillment. Every entrepreneur should be entitled to raise funding from willing investors. It is a uniquely American approach, and capitalistic in the best sense of the word, for it encourages (and democratizes) investment, rather than fueling consumption.
 
Small (under $1 billion) companies can raise money directly from small investors in a formalization of the ?crowdfunding? approach, whereby a project?s principals post their plans on a Website and ask for money, essentially opening up the initial public offering (IPO) market. The theory underlying the law is that there will be a new set of accredited third-party marketplaces, rather than the overburdened Securities and Exchange Commission (which missed Bernie Madoff's monster Ponzi scheme), will ensure that entrepreneurs tell the truth and that investors know what they are buying.  (Of course, that begs the question of how thoroughly vetted and reliable those third-party marketplaces andtheir vetting systems will be.)
 
While this initiative was born in the United States, many countries are wondering how to jumpstart their own entrepreneurial sectors, and may be tempted to follow America?s lead. So why do I hope that they resist that temptation?
 
Unfortunately, the JOBS Act is as likely to be successful as the US government's earlier attempts to ensure that  American families could buy their own homes. Low down payments, deferred interest, and other enticements made it attractive for people to buy their own homes (or to speculate with second homes) whether they could afford to or not.
 
Mortgage brokers were happy to get in on the act. Some were driven by an honest mission to expand property ownership; others were driven by greed. Some knew that the people to whom they were selling houses could not afford it; others simply did not want to know. Some played by the rules; others forged documents. The banks that originated mortgage loans sold their portfolios to investors who didn't really understand what they were buying. 
 
In the same way, the JOBS Act will ease life for some deserving people ? and most likely attract many more who are less deserving. The new system will attract scam artists and promoters who will encourage unsuitable companies to seek investment and oversell the companies to individuals who can't afford to lose the money that they invest.
 
I wish I had more faith in the system, but the problem is not a lack of good people, good investors, or good entrepreneurs. The problem is that, without regulation, bad people take advantage of the good ones. While regulation and restrictions may hamper small business, not all regulation and restrictions are useless.
 
Yes, there are some wonderful, honest companies that deserve investment and can?t get it, but they are not that common. I see a lot of start-ups. Many are appealing and have good ideas, yet most of them fail. Now the  quality even of the honest start-ups is likely to decline as there are more of them, and they will spend more of other people?s money before failing.
 
For example, with more start-ups, it will be even harder for each of them to find  management talent and the right employees. Indeed, many people whom an entrepreneur might have hired will probably become the CEOs of competing start-ups. Meanwhile, all of them will be competing for a finite number of customers, and those companies that make progress will then have to compete for scarcer scale-up capital.
 
Many investors in these startups are likely to lose their money. Even under the current system, many angel investors lose money. The best route to success in angel investing is to invest in, say, ten or more separate companies, so that you have the chance of at least one big winner. But again, a broader investor pool is likely to reduce the average number of investments per investor, with inadequate diversification leading to many more losers than winners.
 
The faith that drives the JOBS Act is the same magical thinking that drives many Internet phenomena: People are good and everyone means well. But the Internet?s easy accessibility and low entry barriers have led to spam and malware and bad behavior; each new service starts out ?clean,? but then ends up requiring its own regulations.
 
Just ask eBay, Google, or Facebook how much they spend on security, fraud detection, and the like. They don?t want to tell you, which says a lot. As on the Internet, so in real life: sometimes friction has a purpose.

  "
Esther-Dyson,"+1 to everything above... but beyond that, great conferences have a purpose beyond entertainment. If you leave the same as you came, that purpose was not fulfilled.  Each person gets their own particular benefit (and fulfills their own purpose), but in the end, the conference has to *do* something - outline a new industry (or at least a trend), galvanize people to create or fix something, announce something, whatever.  Conferences need an MC (or a pair) that have some vision... (Most hired MCs don't qualify, IMHO.) A great conference, like a play or any other performance, needs rhythm and flow - but it's closer to jazz than than to opera.  The excitement is in spontaneity:  The organizers need to have that purpose, but if they know *exactly* what they want, what's the point of the conference?


As for little things - fewer slides, more audience* participation (with a well-lighted room so people can see one another), badges big enough to read, enough places to sit for smaller conversations, etc.  (*yes, I know, even the concept of ""audience"" is passe.)

And another trick:  Put the conference somewhere remote (but conveniently near an airport), so that the ""important"" people come and stay, rather than pop in to address the audience and leave.  Make the speakers stick around and mingle... 

Beyond that, match the format to the purpose.  Sponsor/no sponsors, small/big, mostly ""un""/highly structured.... all work if they fit the purpose.

personally, I love new, small conferences around new topics where people can find one another and create a new market - e.g. the recent Quantified Self conference in Mountain View.  On the other hand, I love AllThingsD and was really bummed I had to miss it this year  (because of an immovable board meeting).

Also, a short plug for www.lanyrd.com, a great Twitter-based tool to enrich conferences (and provide context around speakers).

Morgan-Brown,"Prior to the launch of Fab, Jason Goldberg made several smart moves, driven by some key insights into the design market and his target customer, to propel Fab to a massive launch.

The results from a blog post Jason wrote post-launch[2]:

38% of all visitors came from our email campaign.  Here, building up an opt-in subscriber list of nearly 200,000 members pre-launch really paid off.

30% of all visitors came from typing www.fab.com into a browser window.  This can also be attributed to the pre-launch member list as well as good word of mouth.

10% of all visitors came from Twitter links.  We were fortunate to have the likes of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore Kutcher tweet about us.

9% of all visitors came from Facebook.

1.6% of all visitors came from organic google searches.

1.5% of all visitors came from this New York Times article about our launch.

1% of all visitors came from this TechCrunch article about our launch.

1% of all visitors came from this Cool Material article. about our launch.

1% of all visitors came from this Apartment Therapy article about our launch.

About 0.5% of visitors came from each of:  CoolHunting, DailySugar, andDesign-Milk.

The following are my personal observations about what Fab did right as I've studied their success.

Understanding the Customer - The Vitra Eames Elephant Giveaway
Fab knew exactly the type of customer they wanted to go after and understood from that persona the things that would resonate with them and catch their attention. Prior to launch Fab ran a sweepstakes giving away eight Vitra Eames Elephants[2]. These elephants are expensive, somewhat of a collectors item, and are made by a powerful design brand, Vitra. Additionally they were originally designed by Charles & Ray Eames, two legends of modern design.
The sweepstakes was built to be viral, with users receiving additional entries for each friend they referred who entered the sweepstakes.

This promotion went like wildfire but it was based on understanding the core customer and identifying what would resonate with that customer. Giving away something coveted by the design-minded, and pegging themselves to a brand like Vitra and the Eames legacy, let people in their target audience know that they knew what they were doing.

Understanding Viral Marketing
In addition to the brilliant Vitra Eames giveaway with it's incentives to refer friends, Fab had a gamified pre-launch page which encouraged people to refer friends to move up the invite list for early access. They coupled this powerful status mechanic, with the ability to earn additional credits once the site launched.

You may say many people do this, but what is special about Fab's case is that they really understood the motivators that drove their audience to act. Gabe Zichermann often references the main motivations when it comes to users taking action. In order of importance, those are:
Status
Access
Power
Stuff

Most referral programs simply start at ""stuff"" (AKA money) by giving people $10 when they refer a friend who joins. Fab understood that in the hierarchy of motivations ""Stuff"" is actually at the bottom. So they built the page to give people who invited more people in ""Status"" by making high referrers ""Founding Members"" and ""Access"" by promising those that referred the most early access ahead of the general public. They made sure to tie in the ""Stuff"" with credit incentives, but they got the other pieces of the puzzle right to drive that referral loop.

Product Building Community
They made a couple of key decisions when it came to pre-launch product.

1. They built their own viral landing page. Many companies use LaunchRock or other viral pages, but Fab built it's own to provide the custom gamifications mentioned above. They're subtle but important differences between Fab's pre-launch experience and the standard LaunchRock one.

2. They built a product discovery and sharing inspiration board where people could add their favorite design finds from around the Web. This was before they were even selling anything. But it let them do a couple of things:

a. Get people engaged with the site and build community around great deisgn.
b. Develop a list of products and designers that were important to their potential customers and a great list of leads to run down for early product sales.
c. Create brand awareness and repeat visits prior to launch/commerce.
d. Create a curated experience that pointed to what Fab was going to become and gave people credit for adding unique things (it was almost like a pre-cursor to Pinterest.)

This gave them a bunch of regular users before they even started selling stuff.

Smart PR
Jason and his team are great storytellers. Jason blogs regularly at BetaShop[3] and loves interacting with users, influencers and bloggers. Fab drove a ton of traffic from PR during it's initial launch, which resulted from their team's ability to tell a compelling story.

Disrupting the Market with a Great Product
Last, but certainly not least, Fab disrupted a very fragmented market by pulling together a collection of design finds that was easy to browse and buy, with a discount to boot. Shopping modern design prior to Fab was exceptionally hard. Small boutiques with terrible websites, bad customer service policies and prices that were all basically governed by the designers and MAP pricing.

Fab turned all of that on its head with a superior product that made design accessible to more shoppers, removed inefficiencies from modern design furniture ecommerce, and unlocked the latent demand in the marketplace because of it.

Post-Launch Success
Following the big launch I believe Fab has done several things exceptionally well to drive them to become a premier ecommerce player:

Email marketing - they are very aggressive email marketers, but have provided detailed controls that keep most people subscribed even with the large volume of email.

Continual referral programs - they are smart about dropping in limited time bonuses and incentives to drive referrals to the site.

Product innovation - they continue to innovate and add compelling elements to their product.

Analytics/Data - Jason and team use both RJ Metrics and Custora to better understand their customer and experiences to drive their business.

Shifting of Value Proposition/Brand Positioning - They've moved away from daily deals to more of an Amazon model with a ton of SKUs across dozens and dozens of categories.

Listening to Customers - They do a great job of surveying and learning from customers.

Segmentation - They're segmentation (as seen from their email practices) is top notch and allows them to engage with customers in a relevant and meaningful way.

Morgan-Brown,"If you think of Google+ as a destination, then you could be forgiven for thinking it isn't as lively as other social outposts. However to think of G+ in that way is to not comprehend what it actually is.

Google+ isn't a place, it's a new layer on the Google stack. It permeates and aggregates everything. It personalizes and ties your activities back across every platform, finally giving Google a holistic view of a person's activity online.

Google+ is also in very early days. While the integrations they've completed to-date are impressive, there are so many more to really bring the vision to life.

Facebook started out wanting to be the social plumbing of the Web. That changed when they needed to ramp revenue. Google is building the true social fabric of the Web, and it will be indistinguishable from their products over time.

Whether your friends are actually at Google+ at the moment is irrelevant. It's the aggregate interactions and new layer that is the real network, and that is growing and thriving and isn't going anywhere for a long time to come.

Morgan-Brown,"Audible uses credits because it fits their primary customer relationship model best. Audible primarily sells subscriptions marketed, roughly, as ""get 1 book a month"" or ""get 2 books a month"" for a monthly fee. By using credits members are able to pick any book on Audible with one credit. It makes the positioning and marketing of the membership plan much simpler to explain and understand. That way for members they never have to worry about if they have $15/month for books and one costs $27/etc.

When you have a subscription service like Audible's a digital good like an audio book file, you can leverage the economies of low marginal costs and basically come up with a formula that let's you calculate how many books you can offer per month, at how much $$ per month, and be profitable.

So it works both for the consumer - easier to understand in a subscription model, and for Audible, makes it easy to model customer LTV and profitability by using an average across all customers.

1. They built their own viral landing page. Many companies use LaunchRock or other viral pages, but Fab built it's own to provide the custom gamifications mentioned above. They're subtle but important differences between Fab's pre-launch experience and the standard LaunchRock one.

2. They built a product discovery and sharing inspiration board where people could add their favorite design finds from around the Web. This was before they were even selling anything. But it let them do a couple of things:

a. Get people engaged with the site and build community around great deisgn.
b. Develop a list of products and designers that were important to their potential customers and a great list of leads to run down for early product sales.
c. Create brand awareness and repeat visits prior to launch/commerce.
d. Create a curated experience that pointed to what Fab was going to become and gave people credit for adding unique things (it was almost like a pre-cursor to Pinterest.)

This gave them a bunch of regular users before they even started selling stuff.

Smart PR
Jason and his team are great storytellers. Jason blogs regularly at BetaShop[3] and loves interacting with users, influencers and bloggers. Fab drove a ton of traffic from PR during it's initial launch, which resulted from their team's ability to tell a compelling story.

Disrupting the Market with a Great Product
Last, but certainly not least, Fab disrupted a very fragmented market by pulling together a collection of design finds that was easy to browse and buy, with a discount to boot. Shopping modern design prior to Fab was exceptionally hard. Small boutiques with terrible websites, bad customer service policies and prices that were all basically governed by the designers and MAP pricing.

Fab turned all of that on its head with a superior product that made design accessible to more shoppers, removed inefficiencies from modern design furniture ecommerce, and unlocked the latent demand in the marketplace because of it.

Post-Launch Success
Following the big launch I believe Fab has done several things exceptionally well to drive them to become a premier ecommerce player:

Email marketing - they are very aggressive email marketers, but have provided detailed controls that keep most people subscribed even with the large volume of email.

Continual referral programs - they are smart about dropping in limited time bonuses and incentives to drive referrals to the site.

Product innovation - they continue to innovate and add compelling elements to their product.

Analytics/Data - Jason and team use both RJ Metrics and Custora to better understand their customer and experiences to drive their business.

Shifting of Value Proposition/Brand Positioning - They've moved away from daily deals to more of an Amazon model with a ton of SKUs across dozens and dozens of categories.

Listening to Customers - They do a great job of surveying and learning from customers.

Segmentation - They're segmentation (as seen from their email practices) is top notch and allows them to engage with customers in a relevant and meaningful way.

Morgan-Brown,"I'd recommend TurnHere [1]

You can get a high-quality 1-2 minute video about your business for $649 [2] (as of 8/13/12). You can also get a custom video made by putting out a bid to their filmmaker network. They charge a modest, transparent fee on top of the filmmaker cost for some digital editing/review/asset management tools, etc.

They've made videos for YellowPages, Yelp, Audi, Dannon, Intercontinental Hotels, etc. And while they're not as polished as say a Sandwich Video production they are much cheaper.

Note: I used to work at TurnHere 2007-2010, but I don't hold any equity, and this is just my opinion after being in the space for a while now.

Dale Carneige's Sales Advantage [1] ? I'm not in sales but it was helpful to learn the Carneige way of relating to people, how to actively listen and identify underlying problems, and how to effectively present a solution in a business setting. It also did a good job of helping me identify sales techniques being used on me in negotiations, which has had a big upside as well.

The E-Myth Mastery Certification [2] - As someone who has spent much of their life in the startup world, The E-Myth Revisited is a book that has provided a lot of guidance to me in setting up systems at an early stage of a company's development vs. just throwing bodies at a problem. The Certification is an intense program that is expensive but does a good job of bringing the ideas in the book to life with a toolset that helps you create and execute on transforming a small business into a repeatable series of systems and processes. Some of it is a bit dumbed down -- the marketing and business finance pieces in particular, but it was a great education on how to turn ad hoc business operations into repeatable action plans that can be administered by others.

Morgan-Brown,"A few ideas:

Offer to volunteer. This doesn't work for every conference, but many have volunteers that help paid staff with things like check in, badge check duties, running mics, etc. in exchange for working a day or so as a volunteer you'll often get a free badge to enjoy the rest of the conference.

Offer to be a conference live blogger or tweeter. Many conferences have live blogging and/or tweeting of sessions. They need people to cover these sessions. Offer to help in exchange for a free badge.

Submit a panel idea or speaking session. While not feasible for things like AllThingsD, you can hone a pitch and put together a panel that can get you in as a speaker or panel participant. All of these people obviously get in free.

Lobby Con the event. Troll the lobbies of the event and unofficial after parties. Most of the networking happens in the halls anyway. People leaving the conference early (for good) may give you their badge on their way out, gaining you access to the rest of the show.

Enter contests to win free badges. Many times conferences will give away a few badges. Pay attention to when those are and enter early and often.

Submit a press request. If you blog regularly on the subject you may qualify for a press badge or blogger discount. Many people try to abuse this and so conference organizers vet these carefully. Make sure if you try it you actually have a reasonable belief that you qualify.

Get sponsored. Many companies send influencers to events in exchange for spreading the word about a particular company. If you have a large following you can reach out to companies and pitch them a sponsorship. You should know what you're doing here, and actually have a worthwhile following before attempting this.

Offer to volunteer for an exhibitor. Same idea as the volunteer idea above, but this time help work the booth for a sponsoring company. You'll get a badge and can cruise around while not working the booth.

Get an exhibit hall only badge. These are usually really inexpensive and can get you in the lobby for great networking.

As we've seen, most payment companies don't know what the word frictionless means, and as long as Square keeps innovating they'll stay ahead of the fast followers. They also have better engineering and tech talent that can develop elegant solutions to delivering real business intelligence to small businesses in a way that's never been imagined.

They'll be competitive on fees, but won't ever position themselves as the cheapest. They'll be the easiest to use, have an exceptional brand, and deliver tons of value in ways that major carriers will only be able to poorly copy 18 months after Square is on to the next innovation.

Wayne-Sutton,"For most startups participating in an accelerator/incubator such as Y Combinator, 500Startups or NewMe Accelerator,  AngelList is a few things:

AngelList is a location to show who's investing, mentoring, etc = show's traction.
AngelList shows how much funds have raised and/or raising.
AngelList can provide introductions and you can track a startup progress

Just finishing wrapping up NewMe Accelerator first class, we provided mentors, speakers, housing, coworking but no funding. Nothing can replace the initial offline interaction/introduction that an incubator/accelerator can provide. Also not all investors are wiling to share information on AngelList.

We still recommended all of our startups to create AngelList profiles and talk with speakers/mentors the accelerator provided.

For Y Combinator and AngelList, they intersect at the stage of the startup where the startup is ready to not only raise capital but is ready to show what they are doing to the world/investors.

AngelList itself is becoming a ""social proof"" presence for startups and founders.

AngelList is also very valuable to a lot of startups that are not selected to participate in Y Combinator and other incubators/accelerators.

Wayne-Sutton,"This was the first year of the  NewMe Accelerator. It started off with a
few conversations between Angela Benton and myself from her working
hosting the NewMe conference and myself wanting to increase exposure to
one of my startups, network, learn and help other founders succeed.  The
 idea at first was to have a startup house, then it lead to launch an
accelerator.

During the startup house phase we asked a few friends who had startups
(kloudco, gokit, pencil you in) about joining us when we started talking
 about renting a house and going to Silicon Valley for the summer. This
is why Angela and myself have startups in the program. Plus being we're
new and not doing investments into the other startups we wanted to learn
 too. Also knowing
that Only 1% of Internet start-ups founders are African-American and we want to... (see post - http://newmeaccelerator.com/abou...)

From there we decided to turn this idea from a startup house to a full on
Accelerator. From that time to deciding to do an Accelerator is somewhere between mid February to late March.

On April 14, 2011 we posted on our blogs  (blackweb20.com and socialwayne.com
(http://www.blackweb20.com/2011/0...
) and other social networking sites an open call for startups to submit their pitches. By that time we decided that it was going to be 7 startup founders in the house ( 2 selected from the pitch) and include local startup
founders as well.

We had around 75 submissions and after the deadline, we announced 3
startups to participated in the  NewMe Accelerator to live in the house plus one being in ""stealth mode"" along with the local startups. We end
up selecting 3 vs two making it 8 startup founders in the house for the
summer and 5 local startups.  Post announcement:

Apps built on the Verizon API of course could reach Verizon users but it would be up to the app or Verizon to create deals/coupons/specials to reward them. Also I would suspect any good location app would be opt-in.

Could you clarify your question a little more too. For example there are beer and wine location-based apps targeted to those niche topics and the rewards are setup/managed by the apps.

With TriOut, we allow businesses to claim their location and from there they have a variety of options such as:
1. First time check-in welcome message coupon/special

Why I am joining Khosla Ventures

I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, joining a bunch of misfits who had some provocative ideas about how the world should work. [1]   Three years later, I started investing to enable other driven people to chase their dreams.  I quickly discovered that the more companies I invested in, the more brilliant and inspirational new people I could encourage.  As a result, for twelve years I harboured dreams of becoming a VC who did this every day for a long time.

Indeed, twice before -- in the middle of 2007 and the summer of 2010-- I nearly converted into a professional investor.  But in both cases, I ran into a world-class entrepreneur with a compelling vision of the future and who asked for my help.  And I said yes. 

But with Khosla Ventures, I recognized a team that shared my belief in funding only entrepreneurs who dream vividly bold dreams. I love their passion, work ethic and obsessive focus on impact.  This is not marketing from a recruitment process:   I have enjoyed Board discussions and debates with a KV partner consistently since May 2007.

Of course, there are other exceptional VCs; some of my favorite colleagues from PayPal and LinkedIn are now extraordinary investors.  But what sets KV apart from other investors is that we are dedicated to a different model of venture assistance where the team and the partners bear the obligation to provide insightful guidance. In fact, I can attest that Square would not be Square today without KV?s help.

In my experience, raising capital is easy.  High caliber mentoring and genuine counsel is rare.  Those qualified to dispense it to a fragile startup are in short-supply.  I am excited to join Khosla Ventures because we recognize that this what the most ambitious entrepreneurs crave.

Noah-Kagan,"Find paying customers before you start your business.

Offer your product to people who you think will want it (i.e. your target customer) and see if they will pay for it in advance.

Almost every business idea is guaranteed not to work out the first try. That?s why you have to Validate, Validate, Validate.

If you cannot find paying customers for your service/product/idea you have a problem, BUT you have also been given the greatest chance to learn why the person is NOT buying and what they WILL buy.

I?ve started a number of my own companies and also worked at a few startups (Facebook, Mint) that have since hit it big. My current business AppSumo was validated and built for $50. Before AppSumo, the #1 problem I found at my last business was getting customers, and it drove me crazy.

The solution? I had to go out and make sure that people actually wanted what I was offering. So I started finding web apps that I knew people were using and then tried to see if I could sell the premium version of that apps to people. The first way I validated was by offering an imgur Pro account at a special price on Reddit to Redditors. (Read How AppSumo was built for $50 for details.)

Keep in mind you do not actually need to have the product in hand or have the service set up...yet. The promise of the product is enough. Recently I started selling taco shirts, but only after my original idea failed. (How You Can Accidentally Start Your Own Company -- It?s a quick story about how to validate without spending $$.)

If potential customers don?t like your idea OR even if they like the idea but won?t pay... you know you have to find out what they will buy.

Before you start your business, and before write up a business plan, and before you start making a website, and before you print business cards, and before you create a logo, AND before you quit your day job.....

VALIDATE.


Most people start a business backwards. They do everything else before they do the most essential thing: Finding paying customers.

Once you know this and internalize it, you will see ?wantreprenuers? everywhere who have ideas, plans, and schemes?but no paying customers.

When we started Monthly1K course (How To Make a $1,000 a Month Business by AppSumo) the entire purpose was to change this problem and help the average person see/take actionable steps towards finding a profitable idea without wasting time and money.

Depending on your business/business idea, there are different ways to find your first customers. One of the best ways to come up with ideas for how to validate is to read how others found their first customers (see How I Got My First 3 Customers). In many cases they did research, found the customers' pain points, or figured out how to offer a better version of an existing service.

Bottom Line: Get paying customers before you do anything else.

Very Basic Examples of Validation:

Starting a Restaurant: Sell what you think will be your top plates at a dinner party. Ask people to send you $20 by PayPal in advance?before you buy the ingredients. Sell 20+ plates in advance.

Starting a Service: Look through Craiglist, forums, or Quora to find people who need what you?re offering. Email them, call them, tweet them and offer your services but make them pay first (discount a little if you have to).

Selling a Product: Send an email to friends and family about the product, what it will do, how it will solve their problems and ask them to PayPal you $15 - $45 in advance. If you are solving a real problem or fulfilling a need, they will pay.
  "
Noah-Kagan,"Every business gets its first clients differently. The challenge for many entrepreneurs is to get their first three customers.

Before diving into my answer, it?s important to get your first clients BEFORE you start your business.

Traditional answers start by telling you to build a website, print business cards, and take out ads. Many of the most successful businesses take an approach that allows them to validate (see whether or not people will pay you) their business, their ideas, and value proposition before jumping in with both feet. When they validate (find their first three paying clients) or fail at validating they either strengthen their original idea OR they are able to find a new business/idea without wasting time, money, social capital.

When we started the website How I Got My First 3 Customers (more than 60 entrepreneurs tell their stories) we found that the way people get their first clients is as different as the founders and businesses themselves. There are too many stories to write up, but here is an overview (check out the full website for all of the stories).

For some bloggers, their first readers were family members and coworkers. Some new business got a lucky break from a local newspaper that decided to cover the business. Although many slugged it out by going door to door to offer free estimates, others spun their 9to5 skills and industry knowledge into a side project leveraging free work for testimonials and referrals.

A few basic ideas on how to get your first clients:
Visited 250 houses in 6 hours. Result: 11 leads and closed 5 clients.
Started visiting forums, going to meet ups, interviewing people. Result: Built an app that addressed customers need and then scaled to grow the business.
Reach out to those really close to you and willing to help. Result: One major client came through a friend of a friend.
Search for people disliking competitor products by looking at people follow or like competitors on Facebook. Result: You have a potential client looking for something better from the start.
Interview potential customers to design the service/product to them. Result: These interviewees often turn into clients.
Some advice from these entrepreneurs:
Don't underestimate forums. We Googled ""kpop forums"" and reached out to fans from there.
Do what you are good at. Go after it. Do it cheap and don't spend money before you make money.
Business starts and thrives on word of mouth, referrals, and product research.
Build relationships with key influencers and potential 'referral partners' who are connected within your target customer's circles, and offer to help them, do great work, even do it for FREE.
Keep trying every method possible then stop and keep doing what works.

As Oliver Emberton wrote earlier, it is one challenge to get your first clients and it is another challenge to get your first paying clients. When you are able to offer some value up front (show them something new, solve a small part of their problem, or introduce them to a new software) and whet their appetite. IF you are able to solve REAL problems for people you will be able to get clients. If you are great at solving real problems (and enjoyable to work with) you will be able to get many more clients! (A lot of people feel guilty charging for their time or service starting out [see How Not to Feel Guilty about Charging For Your Time.] Remember you are helping to make money for your customers and clients.)

I?ve helped hundreds of businesses validate and launch successfully. In the past year, we launched ""How To Make a $1,000 a Month Business."" It?s an interactive (action-focused) course that shows you a ton of real business validations and how their initial ideas, using these same techniques, turned into profitable businesses.

Noah-Kagan,"The best way is not to pitch them which is stupidly simple and obvious. Focus more on building a relationship and educating them. You likely won't but that's what I've found extremely effective.

Here's an example of One of the Best Cold Emails I?ve EVER Received.

I'd suggest to email a current customer who knows them and ask for a referral.

If that person doesn't want to, no sweat. Ask if you can use their name.

Then use the subject line ""Referred by Person's Name.""

Otherwise, 3 options I've seen work quite well:
Relevant and personal. For me, it would be referencing taco deli. The short is that it shows you've spent more than 5 minutes and value the time of the recipient. ""Noah I know you love taco deli....""
Flattery. ""How AppSumo changed my life...""
THEM. Write the email 100% in terms of how it benefits their business and not yours. ""How we can make {company_name} 50% more revenue.""
  "
Noah-Kagan,"Love this question since it applies to so many physical stores.

The key thing is to ensure you have the customers available before you consider opening a physical location.



The easiest way is to use Eventbrite or just Paypal and do what I call the ""home"" technique validation.

Invite over your friends, families, co-workers etc to eat vegetarian food at your house.

CHARGE THEM.

Have them paypal you directly or setup an Eventbrite page with a certain # of tickets for dinner available.

Yes, you can charge your friends / associates. If they aren't willing to give you money, why would randoms?

Let them know the menu ahead of time.

I'd continue repeating this model until you can't handle the # of people available at your house. One option would be to raise your prices at this point.

Then you can consider getting a physical location or a trailer.

One hack I learned recently is there are many vacant buildings you can rent out for free or low cost to use as dining space until you have a loyal following.

A few ways to get customers outside of your immediate circle:

1- Look for people who've checked into vegetarian restaurants on Foursquare

2- Reach out to people on Yelp who've reviewed positively / negatively

3- Go to Vegetarian Meetup groups.

4- Ask your co-workers / friends for

5- Look for Houston food bloggers to come review and eat at your place. Their input can be helpful in improving your menu.

Noah-Kagan,"We built the contest tool in-house.

See example contest here: http://appsumo.com/ultimate-entr...

It was inspired by the contests at Bloomspot, not sure they know that :)
  "
Noah-Kagan,"Yea, that's a big one.

Just to preface, I've had some success with starting 2 businesses (1 7-figure and 1 8-figure) along with spending over $150,000 in cash and 1.5 years of time with businesses that have failed.

Currently I'm helping over 1,000 people start their own businesses with How To Make Your First Dollar.

Okay, now that we have some credibility out of the way, let's get it on.

Let me resolve some common excuses people make about starting a business:

1- You NEED a co-founder. That's an excuse that you don't have the skills yourself, you do. It's 100% more easy to convince someone to join once you get traction.

2- YOU NEED funding. Do you really? If you analyze the core problem you are actually solving you'll realize you can do that in more ghetto ways. I'll show you a few more below. Get out of Silicon Valley!

3- You HAVEN'T thought of the golden idea. This is a huge common thing which allows you to excuse yourself from ever starting. Same with people who have too many ideas but not enough start.

Okay, now that you have excuses out of the way you have to break-through your fear of failure.


                                      Take the hi-5 challenge.

Most people struggle with this or immediate think it's childish. I have been MIND BLOWN the impact facing fear and rejection has for people while they go through our ""Failure Olympics."" Once you go through it, you understand.

So go try and hi-5 one random person on the street. Yea, it's awkward. Yea, it's hard. But once you do it and realize it's not that bad, you get to move on!

Okay to figure out your idea.

The easiest thing is next time you go to a restaurant or business or friend who even has more than $1 (99% of the people you should surround yourself with do).

Ask them this, verbatim:

I'm taking a course about starting a business and they forced me to ask you 2 questions. You cool with that? (they'll say yes and you joke how you just used one of the questions)

Then you ask, what are the top 3 things you are facing today that you'd LOVE someone to solve.

At this point they are going to say some generic and MAYBE something very specific.

Now you have a TON of business ideas. Surprise!

Okay, my PERSONAL preference is for you to really solve something that YOU want to see created in the world. It'll be way more fun than solving things for others. Also, you don't have to do market research since you ALREADY know what sucks.

Example of this could be: dang, there's no X type of restaurant in town, man it's really hard to find a good massage person or where should I eat tonight.

WARNING: DO NOT start coding. YOU don't need any code to get your business going. Limitations will help your creativity.

Now it's time for validation. Do people ACTUALLY want what I'm trying to sell.

Validation is seeing where on the ""totem pole"" of what you're offering is to the customer.

      This is an example totem pole of things I enjoy.

Simply, how important is it for the other person to exchange their time (""money"") for the service / product (""value"") you are offering.

For example, high on my totem pole are quality tacos but low is paying someone to tie my shoe laces.

I'll simplify Validation (really knowing that people want what you are offering) into 2 themes:

1- Pay me. This is NOT vaporware, this is the clearest signal someone wants what you are offering. Say you want to start a SaaS biz that helps people run their Google ads. How can you get 2 confirmed customers ahead of building the product. It'll only get harder to get customers if you can't even find 2.

Note: YOU SHOULD do the work manually instead of trying to code. DON'T fall into that trap.

Also, people will promise anything, ""of course I'd use that."" How about you ask me if I'll give you a $1,000,000? Do it.

Noah says, ""SUREEEEEE.""

Now try to collect that money.

Exactly.


Money is the clearest signal someone wants what you are offering.

2- Free with intent to commit. This can be getting people on a mailing list and seeing if they open. Ie. you want to start a blog / magazine regarding yoga for dudes. See if you can get 10 people within 48 hours to join.

Another validation, say you want to be a marketplace for dog sitting. How can you connect 1 dog owner with a sitter. No domain names, no coding, no biz-partner, just real validation.

Validation is completed IF within 48 hours you can get 3 paying customers or 10 intented people.

If no one wants it, GREAT. You saved TIME and MONEY, now you can find out what's higher on the person's totem pole.

If they want it, then you can proceed to marketing time.

Warning: If marketing and growth is hard it's cause your product is NOT validated.


Marketing time

1. Set a 30 day objective. Imagine driving your car without knowing your final destination. Once you know exactly where you want to go, it's way easier to plan the best route to get there. I highly recommend you using my Quant Based Marketing for Start Ups. It's what helped Mint.com sell for $170 Million.

2. Limit your budget. Advertising is an easy excuse why the business it not working.

3. Do more of what you did during your validation phase.

4. Read this article: Noah Kagan's answer to Marketing: What are key strategies to acquire first 100K users with zero marketing budget?

Kick ass on your business and have fun!


Bonus time

Accountability is huge. With How To Make Your First Dollar, we didn't have it at first but added check-ins and a support group. Shocking the impact people have with that support system when times are tough or good.

Noah-Kagan,"Your product looks interesting.

You have NOT validated if it is that difficult to connect with 'decision makers.'

Validation is proof that at least 3 people WANT what you have to sell. It'll only get harder further along.

Do this. Go MANUALLY aka IN PERSON or on the phone, reach out to 3 people today who WANT what you are offering.

If that is hard, it'll ONLY get harder.

For the people you reach out to, IF they aren't interested in what you have to offer, THEN ask them what their top priorities / challenges are. That's where the real biz / solutions are and validation is a LOT easier to do.

Don't worry about CAC or any other silly acronyms.

Mint's biz plan is what I call the perfect tri-fecta, similar to Google. User gets free product + ways to maximize money, companies get new clients & Mint gets a tiny piece for introducing. No losers.

I haven't been there recently but I've heard that the funnel was rough so getting people to actually do the offers wasn't as lucrative as expected.

Noah-Kagan,"These tips are coming from a recovering let's have coffee person.

Here are my strategies in an effort to block 100% of coffee grabs:
Similar to X, I request clarification or questions via email. Literally, 85% of meetings go to this level and then stop.
If the person persists, I suggest we chat in real-time to talk via Skype. This kills off another 10% of the meetings.
Lastly, I'll push it to a phone call while I'm on the bus or driving.
For the remaining 5%:

a) If the person comes from a friend or respected person (both of these are hard to turn down), I suggest they join me for lunch in my area and let them know ahead of time it's for 30 minutes.

Note: Use http://tungle.me and only allow meeting blocks of 15 or 30 minutes. It's convenient because it can sync with Google Calendar.

b) I have a no-meetings-on-Monday-and-Friday policy that I tell people about.

Update: Recently I've been experimenting with group meetings which work really well. You just group together the people that want to meet, helps reduce awkward conversations, might connect two other people and reduces total # of meetings you have.

Bonus: You can try using an auto-responder tactic to all emails but I find this approach weird.

Once you start rejecting, you feel ownership of your time and people will respect your time before they contact you. Seth Godin will respond to your email generally in the same day. However, since he rejects all meetings and you ""assume"" he's busy, you are more considerate about emailing requests for his time.

Noah-Kagan,"After we grew to 150 people the things Facebook did to convince the top engineers was:

- Give the ratio of users / engineers. 10 million people / per engineer type of thing to show the impact they get for the work they are doing

- Stock options which I'm guessing are not as valuable but still should be worth something over time

- Let them choose what they get to work on.

I do find it weird that most of the people that were there when I worked there are now leaving. I assume this is more regarding more corporate culture and lower ROI on time for their options. Regardless, I think selling the ratio of impact is the biggest thing for new recruits.

I realized I missed the part about identify / find. I can only speak for when I was there about finding people:

- In house ads on the site targeting certain colleges, criteria, etc. Easy to hire people when you target companies and have 500 million now at your finger-tips.

- Friend Referrals. I think they were giving $5,000 at the time. I helped get one person and a lot of people brought people from similar companies. For example, the mass amount of people from Yahoo / Microsoft / Oracle (a few) when the company started

I prefer to come before the Demo Day. I prefer 1-on-1 interaction. I like to get to know the companies, their issues, their struggles, their plans. Demo Day doesn't tell you any of that.

I'm not saying Demo Days have zero value. They teach companies to present their ideas cogently and in front of a crowd. But mostly they produce too much hype, too little value.

I should add then when I do attend events like TechCrunch Disrupt it's normally when I'm invited to speak or (gulp) sit on a panel. And I spend most of my time in the corridors talking with entrepreneurs & investors. My ADD is too strong to sit through a bunch of pitches.

I saw both businesses early. I would love to be an investor in both. But as a VC you can't have FOMO (fear of missing out).

On 500px - I asked a partner to review it. He loved the product but wasn't sure how big their market would be and how tough their competition would be. Those questions still remain so just because a16z invested doesn't mean they're guaranteed to be successful. But for the record, I would much rather have 500px crush it and live with a bit of regret.

I should add then when I do attend events like TechCrunch Disrupt it's normally when I'm invited to speak or (gulp) sit on a panel. And I spend most of my time in the corridors talking with entrepreneurs & investors. My ADD is too strong to sit through a bunch of pitches.

Thanks for asking.

Mark-Suster,"I guess I've been pretty public with the fact that you'd have to be a pretty big baby to complain about being a VC, as per my post: http://www.bothsidesofthetable.c...

Pros
well paid
people come tell you how they want to change the world - it's interesting
spend time on problems / companies you're interested in. don't spend time with ones you're not
no quarterly sales / revenue targets
we get paid to network
we get to go where we want to go / when we want to go*
big t&e accounts (enough said)
you don't have to manage people (the older people get the less they really aspire to do this)

Cons
we're on the sidelines, not in the game. the game is always more fun
individual, not team sport
we say ""no"" all the time. contrary to other answers - this does wear you down
it is a ""get rich slowly"" industry

And as you can see from the balance, you'd have to be a pretty big baby to complain about being a VC [that said, the comments from Anon User above are VERY spot on about how many people in the industry feel, which is why it was so refreshing to read.]

Mark-Suster,"Often VC's tell you ""keep in touch"" as a polite way of saying, ""no."" The reason they do this is that there's very limited incentive to say ""no"" outright because if you do catch a fire they don't want to have shot themselves in the foot.

My recommendation is to stay in touch with VCs whom you respect even after they say ""no"" and you will see the level of engagement they have with you.
- Do they return emails?
- Are they willing to help? (I'm surprised more entrepreneurs don't realize that VCs love to help - even when they haven't invested. Every VC you meet ought to be part of your network since they tend to know many people
- Are they willing to have occasional 15-minute phone calls?
- Will they meet periodically for coffee / updates on the business?

Most VCs WILL say ""no"" the first time. Not because they're jerks but because VC math is simple. In most larger funds each partner will do 2 deals per year. That equals a lot of ""no's.""

I wrote a guide to keeping in touch here: http://www.bothsidesofthetable.c...

Joel-Mackey,"Hands down, the most impressive analysis to do on backlinks is using paid software to go out and crawl every single link a website has. Then you take those links and pull in all of the anchor text data. After that you organize that list by PageRank. While everyone will whine about how PageRank doesn't matter anymore it is absolutely a powerful gauge at a glance as to how powerful a website and backlink is. This will give you a better understanding of your competitors (or yourself) and how strategic, funded and intelligent their backlink / SEO campaigns are. You will also be able to detect ""trends"" inside of their linking strategy. To do all of these operations in one swoop, purchase Market Samurai and use the SEO Competition / Anchor Text analysis tool then obtain pagerank data and sort it. You will be smarter and better than all those people using inferior tools like Site Explorer and Majestic SEO.

I do use Majestic SEO as a first line of defense to see what is gong on with a campaign in terms of visual volume and progression for a website.

The two aspects eliciting tremendous backlash are (1) plain hypersensitivity to an overheard conversation not intended for her, and (2) extreme overreaction involving multiple steps taken, knowingly and intentionally, to inflict public damage on private individuals ? whether as retribution, for her own self-aggrandizement, or other reasons.

In general, we are not entitled to ambush an ordinary person on private property, photograph them up close without their consent, broadcast those photos to thousands of members of the general public while claiming on a pure hearsay basis that the people pictured are guilty of misconduct.  Ironically, Richards used (abused) her own privilege to publicly shame two previously unknown people to make a point about privilege.  A much safer way to report this kind of thing while seeking maximum publicity would be to go to the press, giving them the photos and telling the story.  Decent journalists would research it, look to verify facts and seek comment, etc. before running the story.

Saying off-color things to each other, not intending to be overheard is not harassment. We are all subjected to tastless jokes and other offensive remarks our entire lives.  How many times have you overheard a racist joke?  Believe it or not, plenty of women actually find dick jokes to be funny (at least some of the time).  Like, I dunno, my wife (who's done improv comedy) or pretty much every comedienne alive.  Have you listened to Sarah Silverman?  Watched Sex and the City (TV series & creative franchise)?  How on earth could something involving ""dongles"" be so offensive as to constitute harassment if unintentionally overheard?  In fact, isn't it patronizing to assume in this day and age that all women are such delicate flowers that their tender ears need to be sheltered from profanity or coarse humor?  (Importantly, if there were things like threats of violence involved, mention of rape, etc., I will eagerly eat my words.  I haven't read anything to that effect.)

This is noise to be tuned out, or boorish behavior to be reported to the conference organizers in keeping with event policy.  It would be harassment if it were aimed at her, which by all accounts it was not ? or if these yahoos persisted after Richards made it clear she could overhear and found their remarks unwelcome.  Without those things, it lacks the necessary element of intent.  Clearly nobody intended to hurt, harm, intimidate or harass her.  By contrast, everything about Richards' conduct was deliberate, intended to cause as much harm and/or milk as much publicity as she could from that single event.

Instagram vs. Vine for short video clips ought to be a good showdown. Personally I lean toward Instagram because it's one app that can do two things well (pictures and video) + include Foursquare check-in.
GroupMe for group text messaging has been useful in the past. Nothing new, but it fills the need for real-time updates about parties, wait times, etc.
Evernote for making notes about virtually anything, anytime, anywhere, on any device. The Swiss Army knife of apps, it captures photos, scans documents, business cards, records voice memos.

Antone-Johnson,"I agree with the general sentiment expressed by others:  Probably not if it's a California corporation and most or all investors are based in California; otherwise, it could present a (generally surmountable) challenge to closing a financing round.

California is home to the largest concentration of startups and VCs in the U.S.  It also spawned the odd creature known as the quasi-California corporation.  State law provides that regardless of where a company is incorporated, it will be treated as if it were a California corporation for purposes of certain key governance requirements if the company's center of gravity is in California and a majority of its shares are held by Californians.  For startups based here, that effectively undermines some of the benefits of incorporating in Delaware or other company-friendly jurisdictions.  (Without going down that rathole, recent court decisions have called this law's enforceability into question.)

In VC-sized deals ($1MM+), it will always be worth the expense and hassle to reincorporate in Delaware simply to close the investment.  At the opposite extreme, if an angel offers $20,000 but wants to invest in a Delaware corporation, it may not be worth it.  In that sense, it could make a difference at the margin, which is one reason I generally favor Delaware from inception.

The question asks about investors in general, not limited to Venture Capital or typical Angel Investors.  Anecdotally, I've seen non-traditional investors increasingly involved in financing early stage ventures.  If the lead (or only) investor is located somewhere else, it could be happy with its own home state as the corporation's domicile, as it undoubtedly has legal, accounting and other experts in that state.  (Think of a Texas billionaire investing in a Texas corporation as one example.)  International investors often find it beneficial for tax reasons to invest in a Cayman Islands or other offshore entity.

Antone-Johnson,"No.  Ignoring technical issues (does the data even still exist?) and looking only at the legal side, the analysis depends on who's seeking the posts and in what context.  It can get complicated in a hurry, but the basic rule in the U.S. is that contents of electronic communications (as opposed to metadata like time/date stamps) can only be produced to government agencies with a search warrant, and only to private parties (everyone else) with the consent of the subject.

Posts, like email messages, are considered content.  Government entities can subpoena the most basic user information (email address, etc.) but need a court order for more detailed metadata and a warrant (issued by a judge upon finding probable cause) for access to the contents.  It's analogous to police looking at the outside of an envelope with address and postmark, etc., vs. opening and reading it.  The law in question is the Stored Communications Act, a part of the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA).

Private parties in litigation can subpoena user data / metadata but not content.  ECPA is strict on that point.  If you think about it, this actually makes sense:  If you're litigating a dispute with someone, the court expects you to subpoena the other person to produce copies of messages herself (either by just handing it over or by voluntarily requesting her own records from the service provider and then delivering them) ? or not:  These things are fought over in litigation.

Bottom line:  Even if the data exists, law enforcement needs a warrant, and everyone else can't get from the service provider at all.

Antone-Johnson,"Because the relevant stock exchange rules don't require it.  At the risk of sounding flip, a billion dollars ? in cash and/or stock ? isn't that much money to a truly large corporation.  With Yahoo!'s current Market Capitalization of nearly $30 billion, issuing another $1 billion of stock would only dilute existing stockholders by about 3%.  That's significant but not earth-shattering.

Yahoo! shares are traded on NASDAQ.  The so-called ""Nasdaq 20% rule"" (1) requires shareholder approval of a transaction if the number of shares to be issued is greater than 20% of the shares of stock (or voting power) outstanding before the deal (subject to some exceptions).  Three percent obviously comes nowhere near this 20% threshold.  If Y! were making a $6 billion acquisition it would likely need shareholder approval.

What about the feds, you ask?  You've seen SEC Filings by companies seeking shareholder approval for Mergers & Acquisitions, etc.  Well, yes, but that's primarily about disclosure, not governance.  For the most part, federal securities law regulates sales of securities to the public ('33 Act), ongoing disclosure by companies issuing securities ('34 Act), and securities industry participants such as broker-dealers ('40 Act).  Corporate Governance matters are mostly regulated by state law (Delaware in the case of almost all large U.S. corporations), plus stock exchange listing requirements for the minority that qualify and choose to have their shares listed for trading, as YHOO does on Nasdaq.  That said, Congress did poke its nose into corporate governance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, after enough meltdowns of Enron- and Worldcom-sized proportions prompted public outcry, but the governance piece of SOX didn't exactly set federal standards.  Rather, it instructed the stock exchanges to go forth and regulate, and the SEC then gave its seal of approval to the resulting rules.

If it's not clear, discuss as casually and neutrally as possible at a natural opportunity.

Antone-Johnson,"I've seen this kind of provision in equity incentive plans on several occasions in recent years.  I don't think it's the norm, but I wouldn't call it rare anymore.  (By contrast, I don't recall ever seeing such a thing 10+ years ago.)  To give some context, I mostly work with early stage startups in the Bay Area and Southern California, with option plans prepared by large West Coast law firms.

I agree with David Raynor that this kind of forfeiture is generally limited to a strict definition of ""Cause,"" which includes things like conviction of a felony or defrauding the company or its shareholders.  It shouldn't encompass more common scenarios such as being fired for poor job performance or interpersonal conflicts.

Another variation on this theme is a shorter post-termination exercisability period (pardon my French) when fired for Cause.  In plain English, there's a ""use it or lose it"" period for most stock options after separation from the company.  Most option plans allow 90 days for former employees to exercise vested options after termination (driven by tax code requirements governing Incentive Stock Options if you care).  This can be a big problem with late-stage private companies whose employees have vested options at a relatively high valuation.  Depending on the strike price and fair market value, It can mean having to come up with five or six figures cash to exercise the options (buying and holding the shares), getting slammed with tax on theoretical (""paper"") capital gains from exercising the options (with no public market to sell enough shares to cover the tax), or both.  As a practical matter, shortening the exercise period (say to 30 days instead of 90) can make it significantly harder for the former employee to exercise the options, but unlike forfeiture, it doesn't totally wipe out their value.

Antone-Johnson,"Every suicide is preventable in theory.  Depression is a treatable condition ? although in some cases it can be chronic, severe and treatment-resistant.  If a person seeks help from competent professionals, they will follow all sorts of protocols intended to preserve life.  For example, in California, if a person is found to be in imminent danger of harming himself or others, the law requires certain people to report it and authorizes hospitals to hold the person (even against his or her will) for up to 72 hours for observation.  (For you Van Halen fans, this is called 5150 in California.)  Yet our legal system prizes individual liberty, making it extremely difficult to hold a person involuntarily for any length of time for psychiatric treatment, or force administration of medications, etc.

In practice, I wouldn't presume to speculate whether Swartz was in treatment; such questions are rightly treated as personal and confidential to the family.  What I do know (mostly from my wife, who works a suicide crisis hotline and counsels troubled teens) is that compliance is a major challenge in the mental health field.  The very forces that can knock someone out of whack to begin with can challenge their judgment regarding perceived need or willingness to seek or remain in treatment.  As with substance abuse, intervention by concerned family or close friends can sometimes overcome resistance.  No doubt in every case many people ask themselves in hindsight whether there is anything they could have done differently.  That must be incredibly painful.

Antone-Johnson,"1.  The United States population as a whole is outraged by such an extreme (and rare) incident of mass murder targeting children.  Whether or not that specific incident was truly preventable, the collective impulse to ""do something"" is very strong, not limited to the tech community.  (See for, example, the Hollywood-produced ""Demand A Plan"" short video: https://www.facebook.com/DemandAPlan featuring a large number of Celebrities calling for action.)  In that sense I think the tech community is mirroring a broader consensus.

2.  ""Do something"" is more likely to mean government action in areas where Liberalism predominates, such as major coastal cities where the tech industry is concentrated, where people place more faith in the power of government to solve problems, relative to more conservative and libertarian regions that tend to distrust government and favor private solutions.

3.  Cultural affinity for gun ownership in general is weaker in many of those cities, where Hunting ranks low on the list of favored recreational activities compared to most rural parts of the country.  There is a lingering ""peacenik"" or ""hippie"" ethos dating back to the 1960s and 70s in the San Francisco Bay Area, as I can attest from growing up here, which is at odds with recreational gun ownership.

4.  The Technology Industry in general, and the Bay Area in particular, is highly international, including a large number of educated immigrants from Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  This gives a more global range of voices than those available to the vast majority of Americans, most of whom don't even own passports.  Drawing on their experience in other stable democracies in the developed world, visitors and immigrants from Western Europe and  Commonwealth of Nations countries seem mystified by prevailing U.S. values regarding private gun ownership.  They often point to similar high-profile Mass Shootings in the United Kingdom and Australia that were followed by strict gun control measures; in those countries, even conservatives joined in broadly supporting gun control, suggesting a significant ideological split with American conservatives.

The most remarkable example in my opinion is Rupert Murdoch's tweet (@rupertmurdoch: Terrible news today. When will ...  ) calling for stronger gun control in response to the Newtown School Shooting (Dec 2012).  I say ""remarkable"" because Murdoch, while Australian-born, has been a U.S. citizen since 1985, is controlling shareholder of a global media empire headquartered in New York City that owns Fox News (cable news network), and is a renowned conservative.

Antone-Johnson,"As things stand today, the U.S. Supreme Court can't really do that. The two cases it's agreed to review relate to the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and California Prop 8 (2008 ballot initiative) (meant to overturn the state supreme court's finding that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right). It's not reviewing the laws of all other states that relate to gay marriage one way or another.

I'm not a DOMA expert and have no interest in drilling down on all of the law's specific effects. Broadly, it's a federal law that was intended to supersede laws in more liberal states that might otherwise permit gay marriage. If the Supremes invalidate DOMA, it means the federal government is out of the business of deciding who can marry whom on the basis of their gender. That still leaves the laws of 50 states, each of which has the power and authority to regulate marriage, grant licenses, delegate authority to perform marriage ceremonies, etc.

If the Court invalidates Prop. 8, the law in California will revert to what it was before that initiative took effect: Same-sex marriage will be a right under the California state constitution and state government officials will have to act accordingly.  That's essentially the end of the story.  In all other states, it's not that simple.  Each state will have to evaluate its own laws and court rulings on the subject, compare to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the California initiative, and determine whether its own law(s) are clearly unconstitutional based on the Court's holding.  If it's crystal clear, states would be foolish to resist.  If it's murky ? or apparent that a given state's legal situation is radically different from California's, which could be the case for a multitude of reasons ? that state could hold out and refuse to do anything differently until compelled by court decisions interpreting the Supreme Court's guidance and applying it.

In practice, if politics play a role (shocking!), unless the Supreme Court's holding in Hollingsworth is exceptionally broad and powerfully worded, I'd expect at least some states to drag their feet.  Things will end up back in court at various levels in various states, and although judges won't flatly refuse to follow recent Supreme Court precedent, there will be intense political pressure (in, say, Utah or Mississippi) to distinguish their own laws from California's, try again with more narrowly worded laws or amendments to state constitutions, temporize, obfuscate, you name it.  A good historical guide is school desegregation in the South, which didn't magically occur overnight after the Court's historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education.

Antone-Johnson,"Often a chunk (sometimes a very large chunk) of the capital raised is for secondary sales ? that is, founders selling some portion of their own outstanding shares to investors.  Unlike newly issued shares, secondary sales generate zero cash for the company.  Usually the breakdown between newly issued and secondary shares is kept quiet because it's bad PR for insiders to be selling and VCs like to be seen as adding value with an injection of capital rather than merely placing a financial bet.  But just to make up a hypothetical example, a late-stage startup could close a $140 million venture round of which $100 million was used to buy out founders (and perhaps early employees), and only $40MM was raised for working capital.

From 2004-08, only four S&P 500 companies appointed CEOs under 40.  It's incredibly rare.  It earns her a place in history.  (By contrast, with all due respect, executives other than CEO or Chairman generally vanish into obscurity over time, even at the largest companies.)

Being CEO at this kind of company is an overwhelmingly external-facing role, but played in a different, much bigger league.  Instead of giving interviews or keynotes at tech conferences, we're talking major TV appearances, Congressional hearings, a relentless series of interviews with the most widely read business and tech journalists, etc.  The job is really part Chief PR Officer, Chief IR Officer, Chief Goverment Relations Officer, and more ? while overseeing and leading the company's entire business strategy, operations and financial performance while you're at it.

All of the above is why Google Inc. (company) hired Eric Schmidt way-back-when.  They needed someone who'd been-there, done-that.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"Two different scenarios, but I'd put it down to timing and logistics.  The CEO position is unique:  She is hired and fired by the Board of Directors.  Board members don't come to work at company headquarters like everyone else; they're often in other parts of the country or overseas.  If the Board is going to fire the CEO, I assume it would first meet in a private session to make that decision, then task one of the members (hopefully the one closest to, and with the best relationship with, the CEO) to make the phone call and break the bad news privately.  Then hold a meeting with the whole Board (at least by conference call) at which a resolution is passed thanking her for her service, etc., and approving various administrative and transitional details.

Giving notice by phone strikes me as a bit unusual, but again, depending on logistics, if you need to quit this week and your boss is on a business trip to Europe or Asia, sometimes doing it in person is not an option.

Antone-Johnson,"Lots of good stuff here but I feel compelled to represent:

Eagle Rock - largely unknown unless you attended Occidental College (like Barack Obama before he transferred to Columbia), sandwiched between central Glendale and Pasadena, it's part of the City of Los Angeles, although residents have an independent spirit and resist that identification.  Considered by many to be an up-and-coming hip neighborhood for years now, it's finally come into its own with a string of great places popping up along Colorado Ave.North of Colorado are some beautiful tree-lined streets with historic Craftsman homes, a preview of Pasadena to the east.  When you're done, head east along an unremarkable stretch of Colorado until it becomes Colorado Blvd. in western Pasadena and crosses the (in)famous ""suicide bridge"" over Arroyo Seco.  Beautiful view of the mountains and the bridge itself is an elegant piece of architecture, plus you'll end up in the heart of Old Pasadena.

Studio City - easy to overlook, but there's a little village along Tujunga Ave. with some great shops and restaurants (Aroma Cafe is hugely popular).  Less seedy than NoHo, yet more down-to-earth than the ritzier stretches of Ventura Blvd., it runs just a couple blocks south of Moorpark.  Classic beautiful neighborhoods on adjoining residential streets.  Ventura Blvd. is well known, but in typical LA fashion, attractions are spread out along a couple car-oriented miles.  The stretch just west of Laurel Canyon Blvd. is a dense pedestrian-friendly portion.  When you get sick of cars and traffic, head a few blocks up the hill on Laurel Canyon and go for a hike in Wilacre Park (usually called Fryman Canyon by locals).  The surrounding neighborhood is the choicest part of Studio City with many beautiful (and some estoteric modern) homes.

Toluca Lake - just east of Studio City and southeast of NoHo, this primarily residential area is one of the prettiest in the Valley.  Popularized by Bob Hope decades ago, it's become trendy again as a place for many young Hollywood celebrities to live because of its combination of large, lavish homes on pretty streets and convenient close proximity to many studios.  There are quite a few places worth exploring along the main drag, Riverside Drive, including the historic mid-century Bob's Big Boy.

Burbank Rancho - this one is off practically everyone's radar.  A small piece of southern Burbank east of the Media District has the unique distinction of being zoned for horses.  Beyond the LA Equestrian Center itself, the surrounding blocks are lined with mostly unremarkable suburban homes, but behind many of them are stables instead of pools or garages.  Particularly on a nice sunny weekend day, it's fun to wander around this area and ""share the road"" with people on horseback as well as the usual cars, bikes and motorcycles.  The zoning isn't accidental; there are equestrian trails leading directly into Griffith Park, which has something like 50 miles of trails to ride, stretching up and over Mt. Cahuenga and down to Beachwood and Bronson Canyons on the Hollywood side.

Wow, there is so much more to write about.  Greater LA is both enormous and fascinating.

The data (coming from the site's owner) should be considered totally unreliable unless and until it can be validated with a third-party audience metric service (Quantcast, Compete, Inc., Alexa, Comscore, etc.).

  "
Antone-Johnson,"I would almost always recommend forming a Delaware corporation, doing at least a basic name search, and handling the initial round of formation documents (issuing stock to founders and assigning Intellectual Property ownership to the company) before pitching to Venture Capital Firms.  It's not that this will impress them per se, but rather that getting it out of the way ? and doing it the right way from their point of view (meaning the way that's been the norm for decades), using a lawyer or firm that ""gets it"" ? enables you to cross off an item on their long list of concerns before investing.  It's one less thing for investors to worry about, and it's an indication that you understand ""how the game is played.""
 
Others may tell you it's not important, or that the form of entity doesn't matter, or that the documents are boilerplate and can be done by downloading them from the Internet, etc. They are simply wrong, and as an entrepreneur, it's reckless to place the future of what may turn out to be the greatest achievement of your lifetime at risk because you couldn't or wouldn't scrape together a few thousand dollars to get started on the right foot with a competent startup lawyer.  (David S. Rose is right in his ballpark estimate of fees.)

It's less critical for Solo Founders (although they tend not to stay purely solo for long), but for any business with Co-Founders, failure to create the basic documents covering IP ownership, division of equity and vesting terms is simply insane.  Knowing how hard you work to create value starting with nothing but a vision and your own resourcefulness, imagine toiling to build a business worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars only to have one of your early co-founders walk away with 1/3 or 1/4 ownership after a few months of half-hearted effort.  This isn't the only example, but it's the most dramatic way to convey the point that having the right documentation in place, including IP assignments and stock vesting, is a kind of insurance policy against such unfair outcomes.

When founders ask me when to incorporate, I virtually always recommend ""as early as possible.""  What that typically means in practice is as early as someone is willing and able to engage a startup law firm.  There is virtually zero downside to incorporating early if it's done the right way.  After the initial legal and filing fees, until the corporation starts doing business, in most cases the only expense is annual franchise tax paid to the state of incorporation (usually a few hundred dollars; $800 in California).  Startups go through many twists and turns, but it's generally trivial to do things like renaming the corporation, increasing the number of authorized shares, adding or removing people from the Board, or changing co-founders' titles after incorporation (but before the company takes on a round of institutional funding).

There are other major benefits of forming a business entity, such as limiting personal liability, but this answer is long enough already.  I would also caution that although a Delaware corporation is the industry standard, and should never get you funny looks from VCs, there are legitimate reasons to go with other structures, usually driven by tax considerations.  Any good startup lawyer will advise you of the pros and cons, and also recommend that you consult a good tax advisor, before moving ahead.  (That said, some Startup Incubators and Seed Programs require founders to form a Delaware corporation with a standard structure before starting the program.)

To rebut the inevitable accusation by cynics of a conflict of interest:  This is emphatically not about lawyers making money.  Trust me, generating a stack of documents to form a new startup in exchange for fees that will rarely amount to more than $5K is not something that gets most attorneys salivating.  For corporate lawyers, there are much larger, more lucrative, complex, intellectually challenging, resume-building deals and projects to work on for big corporate clients.  Speaking as a startup lawyer, we do this work because it's the beginning of an exciting journey and hopefully a long-term relationship with entrepreneurs; as their needs grow by leaps and bounds along with the success of the business, ideally our practice grows with them.

Antone-Johnson,"Nobody has mentioned the third branch of government yet, so I'll give it a shot: Given that it's an unprecedented situation rife with confusion, the matter would end up at the Supreme Court. As we learned in Bush v. Gore, the Court, after due consideration, would follow the wishes of its conservative majority and appoint Mitt Romney our next president. the exact twists and turns taken to get there might be interesting but ultimately irrelevant.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"I was asked to answer this question, but Jim Andelman nailed it already and David S. Rose provided the icing on the cake.  I would just add that it can be helpful to compare and contrast the concepts of mathematical vs. economic dilution.

Some people visualize equity only as a matter of percentages ? not a bad idea at inception, but it gives the misleading impression that there's a fixed ""pie"" that can only be sliced up into a finite number of pieces adding up to 100%, ultimately a zero-sum game.  Yet a growth company, by definition, is not a zero-sum enterprise.  As one well-worn saying asks, ""Would you rather own 1% of a billion-dollar company or 100% of a worthless company?""

Dilution can be conceptualized as cutting the pie into more pieces, and cramming in more fractions entails ""squishing"" others' existing slices to make them smaller.  That's the concept of what some call mathematical dilution.  By definition, an equity percentage is a fraction, the denominator of which is the total number of outstanding (or issuable) shares, so adding more shares will always ""dilute"" existing shareholders in that sense.  Yet what matters fundamentally is economic dilution:  Will adding newly issued shares make existing shares less valuable, and if so, how much?

The simplest illustration is the first VC funding round of a new startup.  Before, it might have net assets that are essentially zero.  Suppose it raises $2 million at a $6 million pre-money valuation.  The founders go from owning 100% to 75% of the company ? experiencing pure mathematical dilution ? but they now own 75% of a company that has $2 million in cash sitting in the bank when it had none before.  That is not economic dilution, but rather its opposite (accretion).

If you read the ""Dilution"" section of an IPO prospectus, you'll see that the opposite happens to investors in the new public shares.  Every S-1 contains the same language that reads, roughly, ""Investors will experience immediate and substantial dilution.""  That's because whatever price the public investors are paying for their shares, the founders, employees and earlier investors inevitably paid less.  The economic value of the new shares is immediately diluted by the existing shares, which make up the majority of the company's stock.  The ""dilution table"" quantifies this effect in a way that is supposed to be helpful to investors.

  "
Antone-Johnson,"I don't know any of them, but I'd hazard a guess it's because of high valuation plus liquidity of Twitter (company) stock.  Same deal with Facebook (company) and others.

Think of voluntary attrition like a car with both gas and brake pedals.  Lots of factors can motivate people to want to leave an organization (stepping on the gas), as varied as human nature.  Historically, for most successful startups, the ""golden handcuffs"" of Employee Stock Options operated as the hand brake that almost immobilized people from voluntarily leaving.  The more successful the company, the more valuable the golden handcuffs.  Most options vest over four years, but even if fully vested, they need to be exercised within three months after leaving the company. If you hold options in hugely appreciated stock, and you quit your job, and the stock isn't yet publicly traded, you're in a tough position. You must exercise within the three-month post-employment period, which can involve coming up with a large chunk of cash to buy the stock, or taking a huge tax hit, or both.  That's kept many people around at the  most successful startups until a liquidity event (sale of the company or IPO).

Things changed radically in the last few years with the growth of secondary markets like SecondMarket and SharesPost, as well as secondary investment funds that make money dealing in shares bought from employees at privately held companies.  Facebook made the most headlines in this area, but secondary markets are flourishing in the stock of any high-profile, ""brand-name"" private company such as Twitter.  So, as an arbitrary example, if I had vested Twitter options with a net value of $2 million and wanted to leave the company, but it would cost $500K to exercise the options, there are buyers who would front me the $500K (which goes to the company) and buy the stock immediately for $2MM.  Voila ? no more golden handcuffs.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"I wouldn't call this ""normal"" in the sense of ""standard practice.""  In my experience, taking equity in clients is a peculiarity of the Silicon Valley startup practice; lawyers elsewhere often find it unusual, and possibly even unethical, depending on the facts.

That said, it's common among firms that do a lot of startup work (like mine) to ask for a small equity interest if they (we) represent a new company from inception.  It makes the most sense if the firm is going to function as general outside counsel, providing a wide range of support in a long-term business relationship, and is offering deferral and/or discounted rates as part of the package.

Antone-Johnson,"Highly unlikely, but I wouldn't say ""no"" categorically. This is more of a classic ""it depends"" issue. Key factors in my view include:

How original is the idea really?
How easily can it be copied?
How closely related is the idea to those being pursued by other startups, particularly other portfolio companies?
How much is the ""devil in the details"" of execution?
How strong are you (and others on the founding team) compared to what they could find and fund?

What is far more likely in my opinion is that the same investor has been pitched similar ideas by others (or will be tomorrow) and may in fact have invested, or be about to invest, in one of them.  If that's the case, it's possible they could glean some details about the way you plan to execute the business that are uniquely effective, clever, efficient, etc., and there is some risk that those could find their way to a competitor.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"Lots of great material here, but I think the strongest point still needs to be reinforced:  Because Google is Google, and Quora isn't.

My answer isn't as flip as it might first sound when we examine the two major factors that this entails:  (1) the general public's sense of entitlement to use Google resources without limit, combined with (2) a sense of Google's uniquely monolithic status that makes it the Microsoft of the new decade.  Quora (company) evokes neither of these.

Consider that the largest social network in the world, Facebook (product), is (or was) a startup.  MySpace, the second-largest in the world (and the largest in its prime, with more than 200 million users), also began its life as a startup, as did Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Flickr, Digg, Yelp, Foursquare, Reddit, Delicious (web application), and many others.  Every social network launched by the titans of the consumer Internet during the explosion of the social Web (roughly 2003-07) failed.  Every one.  AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google and the rest proved incapable of making significant headway in social except through acquisitions ? and even then managed to ruin some good businesses.  My point here is that there is no precedent for a large, wealthy, powerful, ubiquitous Internet company founding a social network from scratch that has scaled to truly significant proportions (tens to hundreds of millions of registered users).  If Google+ becomes truly successful, people will rightly become suspicious of the extent to which Google can mine their entire online lives for private information that is used for who-knows-what.  Quora doesn't have anywhere near that visibility into our identities and never will.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"This approach sounds back-asswards to me, to use the technical term.

Most angel investors are successful entrepreneurs who made their fortunes by building companies, creating value, and reaping the benefits in a liquidity event. They are understandably sought after for both advice and investment capital, but advice is the lighter commitment of the two and can be given in many different forms with varying degrees of commitment.  Capital is either invested or not, and most investors have to turn down the vast majority of companies that pitch them.

It makes more sense to approach an angel asking for advice, not money, with the philosophy that you're lucky to benefit from their experience, insights and connections, and offering to compensate him or her for advisory services (usually stock options or shares of founders' stock).  If all goes well, once you've shared your vision for the company and excitement about its prospects, and gotten the advisor's buy-in, the angel is far more likely to want to invest on his or her own initiative.  See my related answer to How do you ask someone to be on your advisory board for a new startup?

Antone-Johnson,"I will have to go with my usual answer, ""It depends."" Divide things up by grade level and by type of homework:

Elementary school, for the most part, should involve little homework. I attended an ""alternative"" private school where we had virtually none until around 7th grade, and that was mostly done to prepare us for the impending drudgery of high school homework assignments. If young children can't learn what they need to during the school day, that calls for tutoring or extra practice outside school hours, but it shouldn't be the norm.
High school is another matter because of the nature of the subjects being taught. I would distinguish here between types of homework:
Reading at home is essential for many subjects. How on earth can you have an intelligent classroom discussion in English class about a novel if the kids haven't read it? Asking them to read a chapter here or there at home and come prepared to discuss it seems totally reasonable. You can read passages aloud in class, but reading an entire 300-page novel would take forever. Similarly, history classes involve a lot of storytelling (if well written) that can be done at home so the teacher can use the limited classroom time to focus on the most interesting lessons learned, big-picture issues, etc.
Problem sets are the thrust of this question in my opinion. Here I do think it's the case that the students who are quick to catch on can find themselves grinding through needless repetition of material they've already absorbed merely to earn credit, whereas more average students probably need more repetition to practice and learn from their own mistakes.
Papers sometimes seem like a tedious waste of time, but the truth is there's no better way to learn to be a good writer than to write, a lot, over the course of years. Given the abysmal state of writing on average these days, if anything I think schools need to focus more on writing, not less. (That said, it doesn't do much good unless teachers give thoughtful, personalized feedback to help every kid improve.)
College is like high school squared. With greater independence comes greater responsibility. I generally believed in college that most homework should be optional, ungraded (or narrative graded), for students' own benefit, allowing everyone to practice as much or as little as they needed to before midterms or final exams. There again I think some students will need more repetition to absorb the material than others.

Antone-Johnson,"""Why?""  Others are giving intelligent policy answers, so I'll give the cynical view as to why (versus describing any principled reasons):

Virtually all of the lawmakers enacting these measures benefit from them directly
The vast majority of campaign donors and fundraisers for these elected officials are also direct beneficiaries
The vast majority of people in legislators' social and professional circles also benefit
What amounts to a regressive countermeasure offsetting progressive income tax rates can be spun to the public as a reduction in the tax burden in support of ""The American Dream""
Historically, new home construction has been a significant engine for economic growth in the US, or at least a major economic indicator, so subsidizing it makes for ""good news"" that helps politicians get reelected.

Tara-Hunt,"It's not about the apps. Content strategy is about knowing your audience, understanding what they want/need/will add value to their already noisy streams + delivering that content. It's a learning process and will evolve over a long period of time. Great content requires 75% listening and 25% talking (roughly).

I usually start with finding out what my audience is interested in. A great tool for this is Facebook Open Graph Search. ""interests liked by people who like ________"" ""pages liked by people who like ________"" (the blank either being your own page, unless you are just starting out or just have your mom liking your page ;) - otherwise insert pages like yours like competitors or similar products). Start reading blogs by people in your audience. Read the sources they would read. See what is most engaging. Find your audience on Twitter, Quora, YouTube, etc. and consume as much content as you can until you really understand what is engaging.

So I guess those are some tools. ;)

When you start creating content, it's not necessarily about text posts, images, videos - it's about the context. I break types of posts into different categories:

1. Product - who, what, when, where, why - these are the posts that promote or talk about you or your product directly. Keep these to a minimum.

2. Brand - how do you make people feel? These can be super engaging if done with storytelling. They are tangentially about your product, but are more about the customer.

3. Lifestyle - these are the posts that have less to do with your product and more to do with paying attention to what's happening in the world around you. Memes, holidays, world events...how can you participate in these?

4. Community - this is when you focus on your customer, your partners, your vendors and everyone else around you.

Of course, many posts span multiple types.

There is lots that goes into the creativity behind the posts - but much of it comes from step 1 - understanding your audience. But a great book to get some framework is Jonah Berger's Contagious. I often refer to his STEPPS (social currency, triggers, emotion, public, practical knowledge + storytelling) for inspiration.

All along the way, you are listening, responding, adjusting and improving. And your audience is responding in kind.

There are lots of tools to help you manage stuff (Hootsuite, Spundge, Pagemodo, etc), but the heart of it comes from what I wrote above. Don't focus on the tools. Focus on your customer.

Tara-Hunt,"I don't know if I agree with your 1, 2 and 3 or really think that is the reason why Swipely hasn't seen huge adoption. Blippy is steadily growing, though, and I think part of it has to do with their pivot in market. They've integrated retailers like Sephora and increased incentives for reviewing purchases, which drives more conversation.

If I was to guess why Swipely hasn't seen mass adoption, I'd say a couple of things (as a user):

1. there isn't a tie-in to other platforms. I can email something I purchased to friends, but they won't let me post it to Facebook. Blippy does. That sharing helps growth.
2. by pulling in every 'swipe', it devalues the ones that count. Something we've found out through research is that people don't want to keep track of every purchase. That coffee you bought on the way to work is unremarkable compared to the awesome deal you got on that Prada Bag. Mixing the two in one stream just ads work to the 'share'.
3. they added badges instead of really thinking out engagement. I started getting all of these notifications that I was the VIP of Paypal. Ugh. Not exactly a goal. Lots of companies unfamiliar with the social space (and Angus' previous company, although successful, wasn't social) make the mistake of seeing things like badges as the incentives. Sure, badges work for Foursquare, but the ENGAGEMENT of Foursquare is in the social aspect: ""I'm mayor, bitches!"" you can joke with your friends. It's highly uninteresting for people who don't use foursquare to see others gettng badges. Really engaging is harder and takes time. And you have to start with the right people...people who like to talk about and share their purchases.

Blippy is starting to figure this out and maybe Swipely will, too. There is huge potential in Affiliate alone. Both companies need to build trust with their users first and foremost (I am kind of a power user on both - with 700+ swipes/blips, but I'm an edge case) and that's going to take time.

2. Practice until you know the pitch so well that you can deliver it naturally. I practiced my pitch for TC Disrupt at least 50x. Everyone told me I seemed natural on stage. I wouldn't have if I hadn't practiced.

3. Don't be afraid to show your passion.

Marc-Bodnick,"Lots of people have never used Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs. I bet Steve Jobs didn't use these products. These products are awesome.

Also I bet Steve Jobs didn't use (native) Google Maps, which is also great.

When I was a professional investor, I was shocked at how good Android was when Google relaunched it in 2009. I think the reason I was so surprised was that I wasn't a user of Gmail or Google Calendar. Now that I use those I really see that Google makes amazing and beautiful software products. But without that experience, I really underestimated Google.

Marc-Bodnick,"I think the short answer is that -- in the U.S. -- various legal / regulatory restrictions on gambling makes it very challenging to build a viable user-to-user personal betting app. When I was a professional investor, I came across this idea a few times and each time I concluded that the legal roadblocks to building something huge and widely used were insurmountable.

This idea (a user-to-user personal wagering app) has been widely discussed among talented entrepreneurs and developers for 10+ years. I feel pretty confident that these legal issues explain why a good product has not emerged.

Marc-Bodnick,"It sure feels like that to me -- that Box will be sold sometime in the next year or so. I don't know much about the company or the situation, but the market chatter about a Box sale resonates with me as likely to be credible.

Here's why:
The company is burning a lot of cash, and I bet that it will be more difficult to raise private capital now vs. a few years ago.
Pressure on cash flow is likely to get worse. Competition and competitive pricing pressures (including from Google) are going to make this market tougher in the next couple of years, with pressure on gross profits and pressure to spend more on sales and marketing.
It looks like there's a good chance that the cloud services business is going to evolve into one where companies offer a combination of software and storage. If Box doesn't have a terrific set of software applications coming down the pike (and they might), they are likely going to face stiff competition from bigger companies who have great software offerings (and deep pockets).
From a distance, it seems like Box would be an awesome strategic acquisition for a major enterprise software company. From both an offensive and defensive standpoint, Box would let such a company offer a better overall set of products.
Plausible acquiror candidates, include: Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, Google (?), HP, EMC. An auction would probably be very successful and reach a high price.


To be clear:
I'm pretty sure that this POV (more or less) is shared by many others in Silicon Valley. It might be totally off -- and Box may stay independent --  but I think it's useful to understand why the speculation is happening.
I know that I could be totally wrong; it's always tough to guess what is going on at a company. Aaron Levie may be actually hellbent on staying independent and the company may have some awesome products in its pipeline.

There isn't much in the media about the strategic logic of this deal, but here's what the New York Times had to say:

(boldface added by me)

As part of a routine effort to identify acquisition targets, Disney last year zeroed in on BuzzFeed, the fast-growing digital media company, but Disney?s interest quickly dissipated when BuzzFeed valued itself at nearly $1 billion, according to a person with direct knowledge of the talks.

This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Disney?s interest was meant to remain private, said the entertainment giant saw in BuzzFeed a potential ?content-dissemination service.?

Marc-Bodnick,"This is a popular question among Harry Potter fans.

I found a good interview that David Yates -- the director of the final film (and several others in the series) -- gave to a fansite called SnitchSeeker. Key part of the interview:

SnitchSeeker: There?s this one unintentionally funny scene in Deathly Hallows...
Yates: Oh, go for it.

SnitchSeeker: The hug between Voldemort and Draco?
Yates: Oh yeah, no you?re right. We were really shocked. In fact, we saw that in the test screening. We were sat there and, yeah, some people found it ? it depends which country you?re in. So it?s culturally specific. Americans found it amusing, though, which kind of freaked us out ?cause it was like, ?Whoa!? It?s that slightly awkward way that Ralph [Fiennes] holds him.

SnitchSeeker: How did that come about?
Yates: That?s Ralph. I went through this notion that Voldemort doesn?t do touchy-feely. He can?t because he?s a prince of all evil (laughs). So that?s his attempt to be touchy-feely. We left it in actually, and we knew that some Americans found it amusing but we were comfortable because that?s where it played. So that?s cool.

SnitchSeeker: Did you laugh?
Yates: No, I didn?t. I just found it intriguing. So we cope with that. It?s fine.

Maverick director QUENTIN TARANTINO has slammed reports he purposely avoided onscreen nudity in his KILL BILL films because of the current political climate in America.

The 41-year-old filmmaker insists he opted against showing naked flesh in the ultra-violent movies because it would have lessened the impact of the strong female characters, played by UMA THURMAN, LUCY LIU and DARYL HANNAH.

Tarantino says, ""I like seeing beautiful girls' skin as well as any other pervert. But that wasn't this movie.

""I didn't want to sexualise the girls to that extent because I wanted them to be empowering to women and not eye candy for guys.""

By the way, get ready to be told by the media and some old school investors that Swatch and Rolex can compete with Apple and other consumer tech device makers. Don't believe that. See how Nike's Fuelband isn't working? Same deal. If you aren't a technology company you can't make good tech products.

Matt-Mastracci,"Moving on from DotSpots was bittersweet. We spent a few years pouring our heart into the product, which we all honestly believed would revolutionize how people consumed news. Unfortunately we underestimated how difficult it would be to get publishers to sign on and missed the window overall for success.

Another thing that's hard for me is having the great GWT-based infrastructure we built to pop up UI overtop of any webpage basically sitting idle. I'd love to open-source that one day, but it's not pressing right now. Perhaps if the right project comes along, we might be able to hand off some of it to them.

We did manage to use *some* of the DotSpots technology to bootstrap our efforts at gri.pe. The core web infrastructure for serving gri.pe pages is basically what we were going to use for serving dotspots.com.

The great part about moving on is that you have a chance to let go of all the future plans that were weighing on your mind. After a few years at a startup, you've got stuff that you've always wanted to do but never had time for. Pivoting to a new idea lets you finally let go of those in your mind.

It's also a great feeling to be working on an application that's seeing significant traction in the market. We blew by the total lifetime number of users of DotSpots within a few months! It makes you feel good seeing numbers that show people are using the application and it's making a positive impact on their lives. I would have loved for DotSpots to have a positive impact too, but it just never caught on.

In the end, it's an awesome move for us. It's still a bit sad though - like moving from a house you've lived in for years and have built memories in.

Matt-Mastracci,"I don't think the intent of the ""Learn More"" phrase is snark. I've seen this phrase used in many places where the context of the text is used as help documentation.

For instance, Google's search help has ""Learn more"" at:

http://www.google.com/support/we...

I believe that you should read the phrase ""Learn more about X"" as ""Click here for more information on X"" rather than ""You should learn more about X"".

Matt-Mastracci,"When I was young, I had the exact same experience: typing in listings from Compute! and Family Computing. I even went out and bought a few compendiums of software for additional programs to type in.

I don't have an exact analogue for Compute! magazine myself, but I think that Make Magazine serves at least some of this role for today: http://makezine.com/, at least for their embedded-development focus articles. Programming for embedded devices has something of the same feel as typing in thousands of lines of BASIC code.

I'd love to find a resource that could reproduce the feeling of typing in a simple game from a magazine, but the internet might have made typing in listings from hardcopy a thing of the past (to the world's loss).
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"Rooting an EVO 4G carries very little risk if you use the Unrevoked tool (http://unrevoked.com). The tool is designed to safely disable the security on the mobile phone and install a custom recovery to make it easier for you to move to new ROMs. I've rooted, unrooted and reflashed my EVO dozens of times without any problems while we developed the tool.

We've seen issues where people have attempted to a root a phone that isn't working properly (ie: is crashing constantly or locking up). As long as your phone is in good working order before you start, you should have no trouble.

There are disadvantages to running custom ROMs of course: the stock ROMs are built by people with access to the confidential hardware specs that open ROMs aren't able to use. The drivers for open ROMs are generally based on reverse engineering. As of today, I believe all of the hardware on the EVO is supported in open ROMs, including the troublesome WiMAX chip.

Overall, the quality of third-party ROMs is very high. You'll want to choose one that is actively maintained and has been around for a while.

Even if you choose not to run a custom ROM, I highly recommend disabling security on your device and rooting the stock ROM. This will let you run a handful of extra applications that require root (tethering apps, screenshot apps) and let you take full control over your device if you need it.

Matt-Mastracci,"In the grand scheme of things if you pick a compa.ny as a domain name it doesn't really matter. Calling ourselves Gri.pe has a few advantages over Gripe: chiefly that there's a slightly smaller chance that people will try to go to gripe.com and that auto-linkifiers will make it into a link in some cases. We've had our URL mixed up in a few bits of press in the past, so we're very careful to explain ""GEE ARR EYE DOT PEE EEE"" to any press that wants to write us up.

As for the second part, we rank #1 for gri.pe and ""very highly"" for gripe (it varies based on your location).

Matt-Mastracci,"No, you can only retweet tweets from other users. Neither the API nor the UI will let you do this.

There does appear to be a number of tweets which were retweeted by their authors. One example is here:

http://twitter.com/#!/aasiain/st...

The likely explanation is that Twitter failed to validate retweets for a short period of time.

I just tried retweeting my own status from the dev console and got this:

{
  ""errors"": ""sharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)\nsharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)\nsharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)\nsharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)""

Matt-Mastracci,"You don't actually have to create a custom build. You can do this using the Chrome Extensions NPAPI functionality and call into the plugin from a background page:

http://niw.at/articles/2010/06/1...

https://code.google.com/chrome/e...

Your extension can then export an API on the window object by using content scripts. The content scripts execute JS in the context of the page to insert a brand new function on the window object. This function can use custom DOM events to send messages back to the content script, which are then passed back to the background page and into the native code.

Matt-Mastracci,"Gri.pe was actually the idea of one of our interns, Arash Danesh. We were working on DotSpots at the time and he approached us with the idea, at the time named ""Twitrants"".

The original product was more of a tweet-mining operation: letting Twitter users use hashtags and keywords to more effectively complain about companies with Twitter accounts. We tossed the idea around for a few months and gradually morphed it into a platform where people with a complaint could visit, sign in with Twitter, find the business (even if it didn't have a Twitter account) and file it quickly.

We added Facebook logins soon after and realized that Twitrants was no longer an appropriate name. A company-wide brainstorming session yielded the lucky discovery that the domain ""gri.pe"" was available - we adopted the name that day and built the rest of the product around it.

Note that we also built Gri.pe on AppEngine and I'd like to think we're at least somewhat successful (getting good press and mentions in mainstream media :)).

Matt-Mastracci,"This question can't be answered definitively because it depends entirely on what you are doing, how you write your code and various other factors.

We ran http://dotspots.com off EC2 and switched over to AppEngine when we moved over to http://gri.pe. At our peak with DotSpots, we were spending many thousands of dollars a month running Hadoop, our custom paragraph search engine, MySQL, MongoDB and the other various support infrastructure. We could scale our traffic up to fairly significant numbers at that levels.

Gri.pe is a much simpler product from a technical standpoint. We pay far, far less to run it than we did for DotSpots, but we don't lose much in the way of scaling.

To give you a point of reference: It costs us about 1 cent to serve my profile page (http://www.gri.pe/user/76001) 1,000 times.

Matt-Mastracci,"The jack can use the measured resistance between the different segments of the plug to determine what has been plugged in.

IDT offers a technology called ""Universal Jack"" that does what you describe:

From http://www.idt.com/products/getd...

The Universal Jack capabilities allow the CODEC to detect when audio devices are connected to the CODEC, sense the type of device (LINE_IN, LINE_OUT, MIC, Headphone) that is inserted, and to allow the CODEC to be reconfigured to support these devices wherever they are plugged into the system. SPDIF input sensing is also supported. The fully parametric IDT SoftEQ can be initiated upon headphone jack insertion and removal for protection of notebook speakers.

Here's a patent assigned to IDT that describes how it can drive the various segments in various ways. This is likely the technology behind the Universal Jack:

http://www.freepatentsonline.com...

""Nonetheless, if the right and left loads LOAD_R and LOAD_L are shorted together, then the right output RP_OUT will also be driven (indirectly) by the left amplifier 202 a . In particular, this left amplifier 202 a will drive the right output RP_OUT with the second AC measurement signal (e.g., ?18 dBv signal at 24-30 kHz). As illustrated by the cross-drive impedance sensing circuit 220 of FIG. 2, the second AC measurement signal causes an alternating current to pass from the right output RP_OUT through the resistors R_ESD_R and R_ESD_KILL and the transmission gates 210 c and 216 (TG_KD). This alternating current causes an alternating voltage to be present on the sense node PAD_SENSE, at the negative input terminal (?) of the comparator 212 and at the output COMP_OUT of the comparator 212 . The presence of an alternating square-wave voltage at the output of the comparator 212 reflects the presence of a short between the output loads and the presence of a fixed voltage (e.g., Vdd) at the output of the comparator 212 reflects a lack of a short between the output loads. The presence of the short may verify that a microphone has been plugged into the CODEC audio jack.""

Plan your schedule carefully ahead of time and expect to rush from one session to another if you think the next one will be popular.

I/O runs on a number of tracks which vary from year-to-year, but are generally aligned with Google's developer technologies: Android, AppEngine, GWT, etc. Sessions in each track run throughout the day, depending on how many sessions they lined up.

There are areas scattered around the concourse for vendors to showcase their stuff built on Google technologies. If you are interested in a particular technology, they are usually developers manning the booth that are more than willing to discuss their experiences.

It actually turns out that the storage device fails to report that the writes failed and Linux continues to show the old information in its page cache.

In this case, neither T-Mobile nor HTC are fighting back any harder than they do on any other device.

As for why manufacturers don't allow root at all, this is a much tougher question. I believe that carriers are used to having total control over the telecom experience and, as such, don't see any benefit to giving users the ability to modify their devices.

One of the checks we use in our system is your real identity. You link your gri.pe account to your real-life Facebook and Twitter accounts to take advantage of the networks you've built organically. Would you blackmail or unfairly harass a small business owner using your real name, in front of all your friends and family?

As an aside: we've been surprised at how many ""cheers"" (the positive equivalent of a gripe) have been filed in our system as well. Our users continue to surprise us by filing an almost even number of positive and negative statements about business they've interacted with, even though our product is clearly aimed at capturing and resolving their complaints.

The second way of looking at the question is a lot more interesting though.  Can the software and community institutions and policies be changed so that Wikipedia gets a lot better, and gets better faster than it would have?

Here, too, I think the answer is yes.  It's going to take investment (by the Foundation, primarily) in software development.  It's going to take investment, too, in community management.  And on the part of the community, it's going to take change - change is hard for a well-established and successful community, but we all know of things that don't work well, and I think we should be bolder in carrying out short term experiments to find new ways of handling things.

I assume that this means that, as in the film Groundhog Day, that at the end of the 24 hours, everything (except perhaps your own memory of it) will be reset to where it was.

But even that would lead to repercussions, since one thing you'd want to spend the day doing (as dull as it might be) is memorizing a bunch of stock prices throughout the day, looking for the greatest gainers and losers per hour, so that the next day you'll be able to invest with foresight and make lots of money.  Since that isn't really what you are getting at, I'll assume that you've got some reason why that wouldn't work.

So the idea is - you wake up one morning and you can do absolutely anything you want for 24 hours and it will simply be rewound.  I'm reminded of the ""Kill Hitler"" time travel trope, i.e. that everyone things if they get a time machine an awesome thing to do would be go back in time and Kill Hitler.  xkcd: Kill Hitler. 

Obviously, that wouldn't work in our scenario, so what I mean by ""I am reminded of"" is that some people might really enjoy spending the day trying to kill some awful tyrant somewhere.  Today, probably Assad of Syria would be popular.  So if you wanted to do that, you'd want to plan by trying a few months before the key day to have already found a way to be in Syria on that day, as well as to have scouted out the possibilities.

Jimmy-Wales,"Indecision is a worse enemy than a bad decision

I think I am quite good at making decisions, which is not completely the same thing as being good at making good decisions.  But in terms of the overall impact in life, these two things are often very highly related.

I think most people have a bigger problem actually making decisions than in knowing how to make better or worse decisions.  Fear may prevent you from just making up your mind about something, even when deep down you know the answer.

When I was younger, I wasn't nearly as good at deciding things.  When faced with a choice between A and B, I would sometimes agonize over the choice so much that I'd end up doing C.  And 'C' would be wasting time and avoiding actually moving forward.

Get comfortable with making mistakes, so that when you think you are right you can make a move without so much fear about making a mistake.

Remember, you'll never make a good decision unless you actually make decisions in the first place.

2. Look for options that fail faster and fail gracefully

Another way to reduce the fear of making decisions is to look for options that fail gracefully.  Another way of saying this is to not burn bridges.  When I first started on my entrepreneurial career, my first investor was my boss at my old job.  Instead of quitting and launching out into the blue, I maintained that relationship and he was supportive of the venture.  If it hadn't worked out, I could have gone back to my old job.

In terms of 'fail faster' I am talking about what is generally known as the 'lean startup' methodology of building the minimum viable product for market testing purposes.  I don't necessarily fully endorse any particular author on this concept, but in general I think it's the right approach - and to more than just startups!

If someone says ""I am thinking of buying a boat"" I say ""Have you rented several boats before?""  Renting a boat is like the ""minimum viable product"" for being a boater.  If you rent it and have a terrible time, you've wasted a few hours and a much smaller amount of money.  If you don't look for that kind of solution, you are likely to be paralyzed for years thinking about buying a boat, fantasizing about it, but never actually doing it.  This option is 'C' - worse than either 'A' (buying a boat) or 'B' (realizing you don't want a boat and moving on to something else).

Ben-Parr,"Trying to compare fund performance year by year can be a silly and futile exercise for a few reasons:
Which fund?: a16z has 2+ funds and Benchmark has 7+ funds. Each fund is a different entity with different returns. Sometimes two funds will overlap or a subfund will be created for special investments (like a16z's Google Glass investment vehicle). So you have to be specific about which fund.
Unrealized returns: Until Instagram was acquired, a16z had made no money off of Instagram. It's these liquidity events that define a fund's performance, and they happen sporadically and can take 5-10 years to achieve.
Valuations =/= returns: Benchmark is in Snapchat -- a great investment by any outside observer -- but that investment could IPO, get acquired or even completely crash down. Digg looked like a great investment at one point...
Stealth companies: It's tough to judge the full strength of a portfolio when there are certain investments that remain undisclosed.
Different Funds / structures: Say I invest $1M in a fund with a 20% carry and 2% management fee structure and a second fund with a 30% carry and 3% management fee structure. While the second fund could theoretically ""make"" more money overall, my return could easily be lower than the first fund, which has more favorable terms for its investors/limited partners.
It's not even the end of the year yet. A lot can happen in 31 days.

Ben-Parr,"It's a game of opportunity cost.

If I have $500,000, and two founders decide they deserve salaries of $200,000 per year, then all that's left after one year is $100,000. Barely enough to pay for an engineer for a year, and that engineer won't stay long if they see that kind of ridiculousness.

On the other hand, if the founders don't pay themselves at all and one is preoccupied with a home foreclosure, then that doesn't work either.

There's a happy middle depending on the situation. Sometimes a founder can survive on little, and can hire more team members. Other times, a founder has obligations to pay off and those need to be managed.

So the answer to your question is, it's ok to pay yourself reasonably if your company has the money, but remember that every dollar is an opportunity cost that could go to another part of the business.

Ben-Parr,"tl;dr: It's important to distinguish between a firm and its funds.

---
The short, short, short (and completely non-comprehensive) version:

A venture capital FIRM is an organization that invests in private companies -- primarily startups, but later-stage companies too, as long as they're private and not public. It makes investment decisions.
A venture capital FUND is a vehicle for actually investing in startups. It raises commitments from other investors -- big companies, individuals, families, private funds, etc. -- and puts that money into the startups the FIRM designates. It's the money.
A FIRM has to raise a new FUND when it wants to make new investments but has allocated its existing funds. That's why you keep hearing about firms like a16z raising new money -- it's a new fund with new investors run by the same firm.
Firms have ""General Partners"" who run it day to day. They source companies, pick investments, make deals and provide value, advice and strategic help to their companies. They are the venture capitalists.
Investors in each fund are known as ""Limited Partners"". They provide the money. It's important to note that when a firm raises a fund, it doesn't just get a billion dollar check. It gets its money over the life of the fund through ""capital calls"". When a firm decides to make an investment, the LPs wire money to the fund to actually make the investment. They're legally obligated to send the money or forfeit all their returns, so you almost never see an LP back out once it's signed the paperwork.
Each firm has a different internal structure, but for the most part the General Partners together decide on investments. Some partners have more say than others, and some firms give their partners more autonomy. There's also support staff and, in recent years, support staff for the startups -- help for HR, PR, recruiting, etc.

Ben-Parr,"I don't know what kind of structure you have here, because it absolutely isn't typical. No angel investor should own 50% unless he/she is a founder. No angel investor should invest without putting all the money in up-front. And you shouldn't have agreed to such a terrible-sounding deal.

My advice: CALL AN EXPERIENCED STARTUP LAWYER. NOW.

Ben-Parr,"Facebook has built the next generation of communication network, but it doesn't tire in its quest to expand that platform to every man, woman and child on the planet. It truly believes in its mission to make our lives more connected.

Twitter stands up for its users. Even when the government demands private information, Twitter fights back.

Google is willing to make giant bets on the most futuristic and incredible technologies. Self-driving cars. Wi-fi Balloons. Google Glass. Life extension. Robotics.

Google is the winner, in my eyes, just for their sheer boldness to push the boundaries of human understanding.

Ben-Parr,"Equity is worth jack shit at the pre-seed stage.  Blood, sweat, tears, friendship and code are all that matter.

Cohesion of the team matters more than who gets how much equity. If two founders start resenting another, guess what? That founder's going to be kicked out and you're going to make FAR less than that 65k in equity you demanded. 

Your previous salary should have NO BEARING on the equity split you have with your co-founders. Finding a fair split that recognizes what contributions everyone is going to bring and, more importantly, a fair split that all founders will be happy with, matters more.

Founder equity split is an art, not a science. That's why I usually suggest equal equity splits when it's appropriate.

You're at a startup. Whatever you made at your last job doesn't matter.
  "
Ben-Parr,"Lots of factors to consider here.
How is your startup markedly different than the competitor?
How high profile is the competitor? How high profile is your startup?
Which founders are objectively more suited to the task of building a company in this space?
How hot is the market? Is there room for more than one victor?
Why were they first to market and not yet?
Where are you located? Where is the other company located?

These are just a few to consider. A Silicon Valley-based startup first to market with top-tier founders from Google/Apple/YC and lots of press is... well... that sucks for you. You're going to have a real difficult time raising capital from top tier investors.

Notice what I said there. If you're in a hot market, you're still likely to raise money, but perhaps not from the top tier, but what I like to call the market followers. They see a market heat up and try to get any skin in the game in that market, no matter what company. 

I find the strategy to be short-sighted and absolutely idiotic, but that's a different story.

It's markedly different if you're the Silicon Valley-based company and your competitor is not. It's different if you're the more qualified founders with years of experience under top-tier companies, managers (or, better, have successful exits).

But yes, it will affect your seed fundraise. The investors who are already in the other company won't participate in your round due to conflict of interest. Other top tier investors will have to have a VERY good reason to back you over your ""shinier"" competitor. Stronger tech. Stronger founders. Stronger track record.

My guess is that you're not as high-profile as your competitor, otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question here anonymously on Quora.

If you want the top tier of investors, you're going to have to show something is SO MUCH STRONGER about you and your startup than the competitor that it'd be insane not to back you. Otherwise you'll be stuck with third-tier investors who end up adding no value, when you're gonna need it if you want to compete.

Ben-Parr,"It's nearly impossible to tell what Microsoft's value will be until we know its direction. We won't know that until we get a new CEO and hear his or her plan for the company.

Microsoft is far undervalued if you compare it to, say, Google or Facebook. It's P/E ratio is 14.2. Compare that to Fb (98!) or Google (30).

BUT the better comparison is to Apple, a company that's been around longer. It's P/E ratio currently is SLIGHTLY LESS than MSFT at about ~14.  AAPL used to be much higher, but investors believe its high-growth days are behind it... at least until we see a crazy new product.

Same thing with MSFT... there's no high-growth business to be found, and most of its big businesses -- Windows, Office -- are slowly eroding. Very slowly, to be sure, but eroding. And Windows Phone and Bing aren't winning much market share, and Xbox isn't big enough of a business to make a dent to the bottom line.

So is MSFT an undervalued company? Probably not. But all of this will have to be reevaluated in the next 6-12 months with a new CEO at the helm.

Ben-Parr,"Structures vary company to company, but a few things you can expect form most media companies -- whether it's a blog or Reuters.

An Editor-in-Chief or Co-Editors who lead the editorial team, assign stories, and represent the editorial team in important and controversial matters. They have the most experience and usually write less because more of their time is spent managing the team. There may also be other senior editors that help the Editor-in-Chief carry out his or her duties.
Writers: The core of any great media company, a strong pool of full-time writers and reporters who report on news and provide opinion and commentary. At blogs, there isn't usually a difference between a writer who writes news stories and who writes opinion -- you're going to do it all
Junior editors: Copy editors and assistant editors that help keep the news room running, help grammatically edit stories and generally do administrative tasks for the EIC or Co-Editors. Not often writing these people are.
Sometimes there's an executive editor and/or a managing editor. These are high-level positions on par with Editor-in-Chief. In some organizations, they are the same rank. In others, they are lower or higher ranked. These positions often bridge the gap between editorial and business because...
You can expect the business side of the company to be separate from the editorial side of the company in most cases. Pete Cashmore is CEO of Mashable, but he is not Editor in Chief. Same with Jonah Peretti of Buzzfeed. The only case where the CEO is the EIC I can think of off the top of my head is Sarah Lacy at PandoDaily. The reason for this is so that editorial isn't influenced by business decisions or deals -- you don't want a big ad buy by Nokia to change your publication's coverage of Nokia and potentially damage its reputation irreversibly.
On the business side, the CEO runs the show (or sometimes a General Manager, like at AllThingsD). Development and design, ad sales, marketing, PR, HR, event and conference teams, etc. all fall within this group. The CEO doesn't usually try to influence editorial's coverage -- it's still taboo to break the invisible barrier between the two.
However, I think you'll see these lines blur a bit in the next few years. At smaller companies, it's tough to hire both a CEO and an Editor-in-Chief. But at larger orgs, you can expect the two titles to be separate.

At digital pubs, there aren't usually a massive network of local bureaus that you'll see at NYT or WSJ. However, they will have multiple offices and some will be ""West Coast Editor"" or ""San Francisco Editor"" to emphasize role and responsibility.

Hope this helps.
  "
Ben-Parr,"This is like asking what it's like to be a painter, or a writer, or a CEO -- the experience varies so wildly from firm to firm and partner to partner.

A few things to consider:
There are many ""levels"" of partners, especially at large firms. Founders or long-time partners have way more say over a firm's decisions than brand new partners, and they get the lion's share of the returns, if there are any.
At a smaller firm, there's more responsibilities but more autonomy. At a larger firm, there are more resources and possibly a larger paycheck but more internal politics and you have less control over the firm's decisions
Early-stage VC is very different from late-stage VC. The speed, considerations and amount invested per deal are drastically different. Early-stage VCs move faster and typically make smaller (but more) bets. Later-stage VCs do a lot more due diligence to mitigate risk, but write larger checks and are more involved in their portfolio companies (many early-stage VCs, especially those who don't lead rounds, typically don't take board seats; late stage ones do.)

With that said, a few things I've noticed about the VC lifestyle that I've heard is mostly true for other VCs, regardless of status or firm:
Solitary: Unlike a startup, where you're interacting with a team on a daily basis, you're more on your own as a VC. You meet with companies, you run numbers, and you typically see your fellow partners at the weekly meeting or at social events. You don't work with them dawn to dusk like you would your teammates at Google.
Travel: There is a ton of travel in VC. Higher-level VCs and firms with more autonomy have more control over their schedules, but you have board meetings and conferences to attend.
Politics: You either have to deal with the internal politics of your firm, the outside politics of other investors, or most likely both. You can't avoid it sometimes.
Egos: Some VCs have egos that can't seem to delate. The best VCs realize that the entrepreneurs are the stars, and that they are merely coaches on the sidelines....
Coaching: A lot of a VC's time is spent coaching his or her companies.  Bad VCs get overinvolved in the affairs of their portfolio companies. Great VCs provide mentorship and advice when asked and help guide their entrepreneurs with insight and wisdom.

There's a lot more to be said about being a partner at a VC firm, but to summarize: every partner is different, every firm is different, and VC isn't for everybody.

Ben-Parr,"Trying to compare fund performance year by year can be a silly and futile exercise for a few reasons:
Which fund?: a16z has 2+ funds and Benchmark has 7+ funds. Each fund is a different entity with different returns. Sometimes two funds will overlap or a subfund will be created for special investments (like a16z's Google Glass investment vehicle). So you have to be specific about which fund.
Unrealized returns: Until Instagram was acquired, a16z had made no money off of Instagram. It's these liquidity events that define a fund's performance, and they happen sporadically and can take 5-10 years to achieve.
Valuations =/= returns: Benchmark is in Snapchat -- a great investment by any outside observer -- but that investment could IPO, get acquired or even completely crash down. Digg looked like a great investment at one point...
Stealth companies: It's tough to judge the full strength of a portfolio when there are certain investments that remain undisclosed.
Different Funds / structures: Say I invest $1M in a fund with a 20% carry and 2% management fee structure and a second fund with a 30% carry and 3% management fee structure. While the second fund could theoretically ""make"" more money overall, my return could easily be lower than the first fund, which has more favorable terms for its investors/limited partners.
It's not even the end of the year yet. A lot can happen in 31 days.

With all that said, I'd say the investors in both Benchmark and a16z are pretty damn happy right now. You have to be more specific about your criteria when you want to compare performance, though.

Ben-Parr,"If a VC is treating you like an employee, then you picked the wrong VC.

VCs are advisors. They are partners. Every once in a while, they can be your enemy, when they have to represent the shareholders instead of you, as is their fiduciary duty. But VCs should never be bosses.

Think of it like picking a co-founder. Be deliberate and look for warning signs of an overly-controlling VC that wants to join your board and give orders.
  "
Ben-Parr,"I wish more startups founders would do this.

Marc Bodnick is right that building a product is the best way to answer this question. VCs are just people with opinions, we are easily wrong. But we love startups for a reason and I get excited looking at super early prototypes. We can provide you advice on markets, on past products we've seen, and companies in the market to look at.

So the short answer is: if your VC contacts are your actual FRIENDS, then absolutely. Friends help friends. If they're just contacts, then it's hit or miss.
  "
Ben-Parr,"There are some good suggestions in this thread, but allow me lay a few scenarios on the table:

You can take money from just a single angel
You can possibly convince a big time VC to invest in you
You can take money from an angle and convince a big time VC to invest
You can go bust and have both withdraw

The first thing to remember is that, especially in seed rounds, you are EXPECTED to have more than one investor. The best rounds have a combination of top angels and a few top early-stage VCs.  There's nothing wrong with taking investment from both Jack Dorsey AND Khosla Ventures.

Second, a five minute meeting isn't where a decision will get made. It'll take several with a VC. So don't get too excited -- we VCs take those meetings all the time and they usually end up being nothing.

With that said, you're asking about how to use your angel's commitment to your advantage.  I see one of two scenarios here:
VC knows the angel personally, gets excited, calls the angel to ask why he or she invested
VC knows the angel by reputation, gets excited or says ""meh""
VC doesn't know the angel, says ""meh""

As an investor, this is how I usually go about things. If I know the angel, I call him or her and ask why he or she invested. If I don't know the angel, it's not a big deal to me. If you walk in with Eric Schmidt, Oprah Winfrey and Paige Craig as investors, I'm going to pay extra attention even though I'll claim that I'm not swayed by who else is investing in the round.  Seriously, who am I kidding?

Here's my advice to you:
Don't count your chickens before you hatch.
Talk to your angel and make sure he's fine with you bringing other investors on board. If not, then he's a VC and he better be bringing enough money and value to the table to matter.
Tell your VC who the angel is if the angel is ok with it, regardless. Do check if the VC knows who the angel is and bring that up if there's a connection.
Don't worry too much about how to leverage one investor against another, especially in early rounds. Put together the best TEAM of investors you can.
Don't count your chickens before you hatch.

  "
Ben-Parr,"Depends on the VC firm. At DominateFund, we have five specific areas where we try to add value: press, marketing, customer and user acquisition, viral products and strategic celebrity partnerships. Others add value through recruiting, business advice, technology insight, introductions, etc.

Put together a team that adds the full spectrum of value that you need. Some firms, like a16z and First Round, do a great job at providing a huge range of value adds to match needs.
  "
Ben-Parr,"If you trust your gut, take advice from experts who've done it before, and just focus on building something great, you'll be better off. If you worry too much about whether your VC's advice is positive or negative in value... well you're wasting your time. 

I would say this, though -- before adding an investor to your team, look at what they've actually accomplished and whether that matches your needs.
  "
Ben-Parr,"Yes, but it doesn't cover up flaws in the business.

Being profitable doesn't mean your business will be successful or, more importantly, that your business will scale. You can create another Kickstarter, but unless you can get to $20 billion in transactions yearly, you won't be able to make $1B in revenue and become a Twitter or Facebook-sized company.

Profits do mean that a startup has more leverage, more time and a better understanding of its business model. So being profitable is important to investors but it's only one of a group of factors.

Ben-Parr,"Venture capital is all about relationships. You can have almost any background and be a good VC -- I explain more in this answer on Quora: Venture Capital: What is the best way to secure a career opportunity within a Venture Capital firm, when you do not have a MBA/JD?

But in the end, the people who become associates and partners at firms are the ones who took the time to build relationships with those VCs. So go meet them, get to know them, learn what they do on a daily basis, and take more time to interact with more startups.

Ben-Parr,"The quality of ""outside"" deal flow (cold pitches and emails) is almost always lower than ""inside"" deal flow (personal references, VC introductions, etc.).

It may be that they want to be open to possibilities that they wouldn't see otherwise -- expanding their deal flow. Or maybe they want to look more ""open"" as a firm. But still, very few of these gain investment.

That doesn't mean cold submissions don't work. Fred Wilson answers unsolicited emails randomly. Whether it's led to great deals, he doesn't say, but it could:

I want to remain open to randomness. I believe there are great ideas and people out there who have no better way to get my attention than to spam me. So I open that kind of email and reply to it. But there is a seemingly endless supply of it out there and I can't and won't ever be able to reply to all of it.

In my experience, I've had a few unsolicited emails catch my attention for various reasons. So keeping open to the possibility is never a bad thing.

ND-Sisoev,"Like Edmond Lau describes it,

first comes the disbelieve;  It doesn't happen to me (and that was the only point that matches Edmond's description)
second is the emptiness in my mind; there is nothing there as a thought. It happens like a quick switch which empties my mind in an attempt to erase the situation.
then no fear but calmness starts to fill up the emptiness, analyzing the situation to the computer perfection
and the acting comes with a perfect solution


It happened to me twice.

First time I was in my friend's car, alone, and I stopped right in front of two robbers who were busy hijacking a woman. (Johannesburg, South Africa)
One of them left the woman and came in front of my car. My friend is policeman and the car had a police sticker on the windscreen.
Obviously the robber though I am a policeman who has a gun, puled out his pistol gun and pointed it at me in an attempt to shot.
My head went empty, everything became still and silent around me.
I knew that he cannot shoot at me.
...And the magazine of his pistol dropped out.
The robber was right in front of the car and I could drive over him and kill him.
He knew that. I could see the fear in his eyes.
If there was a bullet in the barrel he was afraid to waste it, and in the same time, he couldn't bend to take his magazine.
I decided to revers back, give him chance to take his magazine and run away.
And that was what happened; the robber took the magazine, jumped in their car with his accomplice and drove away.

I believe that that was the best I could do in that situation.

Second time it happened in my house.
I was watching a movie with my wife when two robbers run in the room through the opened door of our patio.
One of them was with a pistol gun in his hand and the other, quite big guy, was holding a BIG pluming wrench.

And again, my mind went empty (like exploding empty).
I could feel myself abandoning my body. Fast. Like a high pressure through an open valve.
I could feel the robbers uncertainty and fear and I knew that if I act in self defense they'll be confused and scared.
So I did.
When the big guy with the plumbing wrench came close to me I attacked him and went in close fight with him, thus not allowing him to use the wrench with big force, and not allowing the other guy to shoot, because I was too close and all the time behind his friend.
But he shot twice.
The first time he shot during our fight when his friend managed to move a step away from me.
The bullet hit the plumbing wrench. (later we found pieces of it)
The second shot was after I managed to push both of them out of the room.
(During the fight, the guy with the gun had to move toward the door, because I was pushing his friend toward him and I could put them both in the room corner.)

So after the big guy was pushed out of the room I faced the one with the gun, staying outside the door.
He stretched his arm and shot at me, aiming at my head.
I felt the smell of the burned gun powder, but that was all.
Then the shooter looked at me in a horror and they both run out and disappeared in the dark.
Later I found out that the bullet hit me in my forehead, and it may sound unbelievable and crazy as idea, but the bullet ricochet  from my head and hit the window burglar  bar, leaving a sign of a strong impact.

All this I posted in My Bulgarian weblog (???? ?? ???????? ?????? ? ????-2), and if you are interested in more details and photos, try to translate it with Google and read it. (Normally Google doesn't do good translations from Bulgarian language)

ND-Sisoev,"Religious leaders like all other leaders, have to strongly unite their communities around an idea or believe.
The easiest way to keep strongly united society is by creating a hype  around the believe, by opposing it to other believes, theories or ideas.
The community MUST have something to prove and a fight to win.
It is simple human psychology which works for everybody and for all societies and communities.

Religious and atheist leaders are human too and are leading another humans.
In order to exist as a strong communities they have to be opposed to each other.
They have to have fight to win and truth to prove.

They'll call each other with names and they'll blame each other for deeds, failures and lack of intelligence.

And now the straight answer to the question.
The atheists do not hate God (because they don't believe God exists), but they hate the idea to have a supreme power over them.
To hate the idea about God's existence is the same like to hate God.

Humans are prone to laws and rules which includes accepting authorities and supremacy.
However, if the supremacy is not forced by law or rules, it won't be accepted, unless it is insert in the humans with the upbringing and the education.

Your believe is not yours.
It is the believe of your parents, of your friends, of your close community, of your teachers and mentors.
Religious people are not different than the atheists who are trying to destroy your believe.
As long as they show lack of love and respect the religious leaders and followers are just humans capable of hate.

Sangeeta-Narayan,"Every company recruits differently and has a different recruiting bar. This is not a one size fits all approach to resume screening, but might help you get at least one perspective. Here are a few things I go through, in that order...

Intern Roles:
1. Calibre of school and GPA along with transcripts
    NOTE: I see if you did Computer Science or EECS, a BA or a BS, Computer Engineering or Information Systems (not CS per se, so then I have to look at transcripts to see if you did the CS foundational course work)
2. High School accomplishments if you are a rising freshman or rising sophomore
    E.g. Were you the robotic team's lead programmer or perhaps you participated in math competitions, were a top coder or you won the Intel STS etc
2. Companies you have intern'ed for
    Note: I look for the role you took on and projects you worked on. I also try to see if you got an offer to come back as an intern
4. Your projects, accomplishments, activities (do you head up the ACM chapter of your school? etc)

Full Time roles:
Similar stuff as above
Entrepreneurial spirit - did you work for a startup in the past etc.? perhaps founded one? (yes, even when I worked at Google)
Reasons for career changes and length of stay
Career progression at one company

Some of this screening process reveals drive, persistence, passion, initiative and leadership skills, technical depth and personality, i.e. the culture fit.

The most intangible part of this process is the gut feeling and only when I look at the resume, I can know if this will be a candidacy I want to invest an engineer's time in. I am quick to get a second opinion from the hiring manager as a few seconds of their time is better than 45 minutes of an engineer's time to screen!

Helpful?

Sangeeta-Narayan,"I don't understand the question very well. But taking a stab at an answer. As college students, they are likely going to focus on the company culture and the impact they can have. The equity is usually standard for each startup for entry level hires so I am not sure if negotiating is a good way of spending their time. Cash comp is usually what they might negotiate if they have other competing offers.

If a startup make a low ball offer and a college (under) graduate accepts it at face value but later discovers the salary given was too low, they are going to consider leaving or re-negotiating. They will definitely leave if they are getting lower relative to their peers in the same company.

I am sure some fresh grads negotiate based on competing offers (maybe very few handful who negotiate because they may feel there is room to negotiate) but usually a startup will not allow negotiation at entry level because it will upset their comp framework and create inequalities within the employee base leading to a bigger problem. By same measure, they will protect all existing employees' comp as new employees come in.

Sangeeta-Narayan,"Future of recruiting is to go backward in the recruiting strategies. The best way to recruit talent is still through networking and cold calling.

I recruited before Linkedin existed, Internet was barely populated, then became one of the fist 25 recruiters at Google to use LinkedIn, so I have recruited through evolving technology timeline.

TALENT DISCOVERY: When there was no or little internet, the way to recruit was to network like crazy, map out company org charts by cold calling and talking with people etc. Oh, and pay several hundred dollars (sometimes in thousands) to get hard copy org charts! It was HARD but internet, especially LinkedIn makes it very easy to discover talent. Google boolean used to work well when LinkedIn membership was still nascent.

TALENT ACQUISITION: Technology has made us recruiters lazy. We send 100+ emails through LinkedIn. It used to work but now it is just spam from a passive candidate's perspective. Its a great way to get the active to almost-active people interested in talking with you and/or to expand your network slowly. But if you want to fill your search now, start talking to people.

Sangeeta-Narayan,"Nope. This response was validated when recently my son interviewed with valley startups, a few started by ex-Google, ex-Facebook engineers. He is a freshman at CMU studying CS (what else? :-)

Anyhow, he told me that the questions were easy and in most cases he had come across them as homework or class problems during his second semester there. He did really well on the interviewed and secured several job offers. I met with one of the founders today for different reasons and he mentioned that while they had a lot of more qualified candidates who were juniors and seniors, what really helped them make a decision to hire my son as their only engineering intern was the culture fit, his attitude, drive and energy he would bring to the company at this early stage. They liked the fat he was attending a lot of hack-a-thons and was selected as a TA to a CS professor in his first semester etc.

It was an eye opener to hear that interviewers ask technical questions which are better suited for students in college or recently out of college, but not suited for most engineers with experience. Look for things like open source contribution, founded a startup (failed or otherwise), ability to work in a chaotic fast paced environment etc. For more experienced engineers ask them what their most significant accomplishment was and why. What was their contribution (""was part of"" v/s ""implemented""). Talk to people who know the engineer's work. Are they big company lifers and want to join a startup for equity upside or are they truly entrepreneurial and driven by the business vision? Etc.

Look for strong startup culture fit over just technical questions to make the final decision. Not all engineers who are great hires for Google will be optimal for a startup, especially at seed or early stage. A lot less who get hired at Microsoft I suspect.

However, it is a meaningful advantage, not a disadvantage. Generally speaking, a woman who spends time on appearance often has an advantage over a woman who does not spend time on it for a lot of things like job interviews, getting a date etc. Women have more options when trying to look nicer or feel more confident. They also have more ways to express their personality, moods etc. compared to their male counterparts. (NOTE: this is a generalization but is not true in all cases. There are lots of women, very successful women, who do not focus on appearances and/or do the minimal needed and are very happy with their natural appearance.)

However, what really puts women at a disadvantage is all the other stuff where men and women are competing on the same platform - the boys club, lower salaries compared to male counter parts, not being encouraged to follow their dreams because ultimately they need to have kids etc.

In case you do not plan to hire for this role at all but were creating a role for this candidate, you could let them know that this was an opportunistic hire for you and while right now it does not make sense you might reconsider this role later.

If you are actively recruiting for this role, and truly want to reject the candidacy, it's ok to mention that the match was not strong enough to move forward. Usually the decision is not as black and white, so not being specific is ok. If the reason to reject is because of lack of technical success in the interview, and/or they just need more experience, it's ok to mention areas they could work on and or simply get more experience and reapply. Most companies I know reconsider candidates if they reapy after a year or after some significant change in their experience. If you are rejecting on culture fit, then it is harder to be specific and it does not leave room for a revisit later. But often company culture changes as they move through the lifecycle and I see the same candidates getting hired.

Bottom line, focus on the long term connection. Part on good terms. Candidates prefer to hear that they did not make it through than not hear at all. It is ok if you cannot or are not comfortable sharing the specifics. Depends on the rapport you built with them during the process.

Sangeeta-Narayan,"The safest thing to do here is give users explicit filters for everything, not just minority. Companies want to recruit fast and recruit well while trying to comply with the laws to support diversity. This will allow them to filter on various combinations, not just women and under represented.

Legal or not, it's already happening. But there is no way to explicitly filter on gender etc, so your tool would definitely  trend if done right.

You should consult with legal on everything you do from a product release perspective instead of solely relying on Quora responses from non-layer audience like me. But I suspect you will stay compliant if you simply add filters for everything. Users can choose to search on certain filters at any given time. If there truly is a need for what you really want to design the system for, you might sees spike on those filters.

Sangeeta-Narayan,"In 2013 I started an Exec Search practice Catapulse Partners after doing exec work for almost a decade while building startups. We do not deserve a spot here (yet :-) but I want to provide input based on my research and what I know.

Robin Reed was a legend during 90's and early 20's - small boutique firm - heard she is not doing it but I could be wrong. Parker Remick may be focused on big companies  as I heard of them a lot when I was doing exec recruiting at Google in 2006. Both worth checking in with. There is Korn Ferry, Howard Fischer, Spencer Stuart, H&S etc which used to be leading firms but perhaps for startups they do not have the edge.

For startups, I have come across Daversa and Kindred over the years, heard good things about them, so definitely look into them. I like their websites too. Riviera Partners deserves a mention here just because of the sheer volume of searches they are doing. There are a few others but if you do a google on exec search firm, there are a few more for sales or legal etc.

""Leading"" could be a misleading when thinking about hiring exec search firms. Find the right fit, look for the right Partner within these firms to work with. Ask your board for referrals if they have worked with a firm in the past.

  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"Every company recruits differently and has a different recruiting bar. This is not a one size fits all approach to resume screening, but might help you get at least one perspective. Here are a few things I go through, in that order...

Intern Roles:
1. Calibre of school and GPA along with transcripts
    NOTE: I see if you did Computer Science or EECS, a BA or a BS, Computer Engineering or Information Systems (not CS per se, so then I have to look at transcripts to see if you did the CS foundational course work)
2. High School accomplishments if you are a rising freshman or rising sophomore
    E.g. Were you the robotic team's lead programmer or perhaps you participated in math competitions, were a top coder or you won the Intel STS etc
2. Companies you have intern'ed for
    Note: I look for the role you took on and projects you worked on. I also try to see if you got an offer to come back as an intern
4. Your projects, accomplishments, activities (do you head up the ACM chapter of your school? etc)

Full Time roles:
Similar stuff as above
Entrepreneurial spirit - did you work for a startup in the past etc.? perhaps founded one? (yes, even when I worked at Google)
Reasons for career changes and length of stay
Career progression at one company

Some of this screening process reveals drive, persistence, passion, initiative and leadership skills, technical depth and personality, i.e. the culture fit.

The most intangible part of this process is the gut feeling and only when I look at the resume, I can know if this will be a candidacy I want to invest an engineer's time in. I am quick to get a second opinion from the hiring manager as a few seconds of their time is better than 45 minutes of an engineer's time to screen!

Helpful?
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"NOTE: I love Coursera, worked there for over a year, ran the first Intern Program at Coursera and worked closely with KPCB to roll in their program. I am currently conducting a General Counsel search for their CEOs. But I will try to give you an unbiased perspective - really.

Michael Wolfe's advice is the right way to look at your two opportunities and think long term while making your decision. Three things that may help you pick your next role are: people, product and impact. For internship less important, but it is important to click with your future manager and have their trust.

Getting 20% more during a summer internship is not a good enough justification to take Amazon over Coursera, unless ""all else is equal"". While you could certainly consider joining the same company after internship, don't rule out the possibility of joining a different company. Diverse internship experience will enrich your FTE experience and will allow you to add a different perspective to your team and work. If you just cannot get enough of the company during your internship period, you should  join them FTE just like Bryan Kane and others did after their internship at Coursera.

Amazon hires amazing talent and engineers from there are much sought after, so either choice is a good one. However, joining a fast growing startup provides you a different platform to learn and play on. This is useful if you are interested in doing your own startup in future and/or as Michael mentioned, learning about the business. If all else is equal, and that 20% cash differential is not a deal breaker, I would always advise candidates to intern at a marque growing valley startup because you have the potential to cram years of learning in a 3 month period! There is zero downside to joining a stellar startup, if you are equally excited about them.

At the end of the day, go with your gut and do what ""feels"" right to you. Only you know the details of your search the best!

Hope this is helpful. I am reachable at sangeeta@catapulsepartners.com if you want to have a private conversation about this. Wish you the very best!
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"You need to determine your own rates for the startup as depending on the brand, you may end up having to pay more than the market rate. So loosing a candidate over cash is not a good idea if you can afford them.

If people at same level are making less in cash because of this request and your subsequent offer, you can make adjustments to equity to keep the overall framework consistent. i.e give them less equity relative to the employees who are making less cash than this new employee, especially if they came much earlier than this hire. 3-6 months down the road - or on their one year anniversary, you would need to consider a performance based cash comp increase to level with the newer hires.

Another creative way of giving someone what they want is to offer them sign on bonus and that will give them what the want and after one year you can give them and rest of the company performance based raises.

To stay ahead and competitive, you should plan to get to 90th percentile of salaries. If you are at anything lower than 75th percentile, it is too low. Market rates have a big range and are not fixed numbers - you need to decide what is right for your company to keep you competitive - not only to hire new folks but to retain the ones you have.
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"(JFYI: I was a software engineer, then a product manager and now a recruiter)

Women like to do stuff outside of work too and not just work 24x7. I have lost enough women engineers for startups to the bigger companies who offer work-life balance that it is safe to say that if you have a 24x7 work culture, and do everything together, then it may not be as female-friendly inherently. Women will need to take more time off to prep for their wedding or might need slight more work-life balance but also need to know the whole team is not work 100 hour weeks otherwise they tend to feel guilty if they are not side by side with their male counterparts.

If you truly want a female to succeed at your startup, hire them because you think they are ""equally"" smart and not because you must hire them and hence lowered your hiring bar. This will bring about respect for their technical work and you will also learn from your female colleague. If you could do one thing right to make the company ""female friendly"" this would be it! Always do the airplane test.

If you are catching women engineers and designers very early in their career then they may have more crazy work tolerance than those later in their careers, especially with kids and families.

The two I highlighted above are the most critical.
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"By using your network. In its absence, try to get seed funded by well known and networked individual investors. You can engage with a recruiter early on if they are open to an equity heavy deal with deferred cash, but you need to find the right recruiter (recruiters are like doctors - hire them if you trust them).

This is a scrappy answer, but it will work.
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"Depends on your own career level. If you were at a Director elsewhere with the potential to grow into the VPE role, you can ask for it, if you were a VPE elsewhere you can assume the CTO/VPE role as you join. It will be automatically under discussion. Some founders prefer to keep organizations flat and may choose not to have any titles initially. Discuss the various career paths but regardless of the title, make sure you get comp'ed correctly w.r.t. equity coming in.

If you are entry level and are made a Director or VP, if the company grows to a point where you are reaching your limit and are not experienced enough to scale, be prepared to step down or aside to allow for more experienced leadership to come in. I have seen too often that very junior or inexperienced engineers are put in leadership roles and prohibit the company from scaling fast enough.

Do what is the right thing for the company. Ultimately, your equity is worth nothing if the company is not successful.
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"Depends on the size of the company. It can be one person to 2 or 3 separate roles. In a larger organization, a CTO might focus on future technologies and set technical direction for the company, whereas a VP Engineering is execution focused. Each can report to the CEO or depending on the seniority of the CTO, a VPE may report to the CTO. Director of Engineering will report to a VP Engineering in a larger company and typically they will own a smaller chuck of company wide engineering.

I have also seen one individual play the CTO and VPE role but will manage one or more Director and/or Managers.
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"Its hard to answer this question without knowing what the search is for. But in general, you should bring this up in discussions with the recruiter and find out what the rates for a similar search are. There is some standardization of rates and then there are variations depending on the firm you are talking to. If you need more specific info, happy to chat and help out with your thinking process.

  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"What are you waiting for? Just do it!

You are early in your career and can take risks. If you do not have an apetite for risk, then going to startups is out. You could switch to safe internet companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and get to work with young talent, people you don't have things in common with, enjoy the micro kitchens, free food and happy hours - and EVERYTHING you listed in PROS.

You need to put yourself out there to find out what you ""really"" want to do. Asking questions on Quora will not really help you make that decision. Unless you talk to a few companies, get a couple of offers, you will never know if you really are ready to make the jump or are more comfortable with your flexible hours and good pay.

FWIW, I was in the application space as a Product Manager/Software Engineer, but started my recruiting career in the same industry you are in (systems, wireless, storage etc. - don't even ask me why!). So when Google came around and made me an offer, do you think I hesitated or ever looked back? :-)
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"Quora is intellectually stimulating while Facebook is socially stimulating.

It takes time to respond to questions because you know your responses will be consumed by a lot of unknown people, you want to contribute meaningful content. One has to think and spend time writing stuff here.

Where as, more often than not, one just needs to upload a bunch of pictures, browse through their feed and click on a few ""likes"" and you are done! Not much time is needed on Facebook to stay connected.

I have observed that Facebook is often used to promote oneself or one's life, to communicate how great their life is. Not sure if this is interesting enough to hold me on.

Either way, I cannot do without Facebook at all on a daily basis (atleast 15 minuts a day to quickly scane my feed), but I can go without Quora for days, but my cumulative time spent on Quora is probably far more than on FB.

I need to throw in Twitter here too as it does serve its own purpose which Quora is not targeting and Facebook does not have enough content - its like a news feed for me. No one cares what one says unless one is a celebrity (VCs, actors etc) - I rarely tweet.

Ok, now that I have spent a couple of hours past midnight writing and reading on Quora, I need to sleep :-)
  "
Sangeeta-Narayan,"DISCLAIMER: My response assumes the candidate is being interviewed for a startup. For a big consumer company, the focus is similar but the scale is magnified and some questions may need rethinking in context of the big company (navigating politics, culture etc).

Focus Area 1: Product scale?

I would want to know about the biggest web consumer product the candidate helped launch from inception and specifically, I would ask how many registered users did it have, how many page view, retention rate, traffic/volume and site uptime, user retention, monetization etc. Essentially, want to know the scale of the site through these metrics to determine the complexity of the product launched.

you can ask the questions around the following focus areas:

Focus Area 2: Interest in your company?

Ask them the ""Day 1"" question - what would they do day 1? Their vision for your product, what direction would they want to take your company's existing product. Let them tell you what they think of the product and how they would improve etc.

Focus Area 3: VP level experience?

Strategic v/s tactical. How do they define their role? What have they done in past. For smaller startups, it is important for the candidate to be fairly scrappy, see the 10,000 ft as clearly as the 50,000 ft view. Have they built and managed teams from scratch, mentoring, people management skills and so on.

Focus Area 4: Culture Fit

Have individual contributors interview the candidate (not just the direct reports). Do the cocktail test - do you want to hang out with them after work? 

Culture fit also relates to the working style among other things - need work life balance or can burn the midnight oil that earlier stage startups need (yes, it is a necessity). If the candidate comes from a big company background, without any startup experience, this becomes an important question.

Also important to figure out if the candidate will stick it out with you as the company goes through its ups and downs, as is common with startup life cycle. Do they believe in your vision and will they be able to internalize it?

Focus Area 5: Compensation & Other expectations

Last but not the least. I know, its hard to talk about this, but its good to flag this early in the process if you are a startup. Big companies, no so much. If the candidate comes from a big company background, feeling out if they will be ok taking a pay cut for unforeseeable future.

Benefits seem to be of importance, so communicate this early.

Well, this is what comes to mind right away.....

Create and complete your profiles on sites where most of the eyes and ears are. A few of the top ones are Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, iTunes, and MySpace. Integrate the sites together so you don?t have to do extra work. For example, when you post a new YouTube video, have it automatically post to your Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace

Be Discovered
How are people going to discover you? One approach is creating covers on popular songs and putting them on YouTube. YouTube is the #2 search engine behind Google. People are going to search for their favorite songs and if you happen to cover one or more of them, you have a likelihood of appearing in the search results. This has been done by Just Bieber, Kina Grannis, and one of my favorite artists Mari? Digby

Long story short, you are nothing without your  fans. Engage with those who interact with you. Sooner or later they will have a name for themselves to create a sense of belonging and connection with you. Mari? Digby has ?Digbyholics?, Kina Grannis has ?kinerds?, and Justin Bieber has ?beliebers?. Thank them for watching your videos, listening to your music, and being your fan. Make it easy for them to subscribe to you and share you with their connections. While social media sites make it easy for people to do so, it?s okay to ask, but don?t be too aggressive.
Build Ambassadors
They will sprout among your fans and they are going to be your top fans. They are passionate about you and will be more than happy o help you in their own special  ways such as creating videos, fan sites, and interviews with you. Make it easy for them to help you. Ask them what they need.
Build Street Teams

Usability studies have shown that while the DVORAK layout is faster and can make more sense to the brain, when learned and utilized, most people are born and raised as QWERTY users through and through. Realistically speaking, I don't see a big shift away from QWERTY as long as traditional keyboards are still a central part of the computing experience outside of the smartphone/tablet.

The big movements I see, with the exception of other Swype like services (which in some ways, really kind of recall the old Palm OS stylus language, which if pressed, I could probably use today without any issues), is in predictive text entry. The predictive text engines are getting better and better all the time. This is an area that lots of companies are investing heavily in, because with the right sort of engine, and especially with systems that can ""learn"" usage, word choices and have a better sense of context and grammar, this can do much to speed up data entry and output.

In each instance, not only has Apple survived, they've thrived.

That's fairly remarkable when you think about it. Each time, pundits have more or less said it was the end of Apple, and each time Apple ended up ahead of where they were when Jobs left. It was trial by fire, and Cook passed with flying colors. That's why it shouldn't have been surprising at all that he was next in line to be CEO.

The longer answer as to why Cook was chosen in the first place to fill-in during the medical leaves is more complicated to answer without personally knowing Cook. But I would imagine that out of all of Apple's execs, Cook is probably the most CEO-like. He commands respect because he has turned Apple's operations into the envy of everyone in the industry. No one could compete with the iPod because of Tim Cook. No one can compete with the iPad because of Tim Cook.

Jonathan Ive and Scott Forstall, both longtime execs, are also undoubtedly strong leaders. But at least up until this point, their roles have been more focused. I would guess that Forstall would be ahead of Ive in that line since Ive is known to be very singularly focused on industrial design.

What will be really interesting to watch is who takes over the more creative reins of Apple going forward. Is that done by Ive and Forstall in tandem? Does Phil Schiller weigh in? Maybe Cook is more involved in this than anyone outside the company realizes?

The reason is simple: the Air is the best computer they make, and the most recent update makes it more than powerful enough for many to buy one instead of buying a Pro (or replacing their Pro with one, as I did). When you consider that some people would like a bigger screen size, and some would like even more battery, again, I think a 15-inch thin machine is inevitable.

But again, perhaps it will or won't technically be an ""Air"". The clear movement across Apple's entire line is to forsake optical media. When Apple cuts the optical drive out of the 15-inch MacBook Pro (and I do mean ""when""), they can make it significantly smaller. Then they just need to trade the glass screen for the plastic one, and it will be much lighter. Boom - 15-inch Air-like machine right there.

MG-Siegler,"We're not just talking any old politician here, like a local city board member, we're talking the President of the United States. And plenty of other world leaders have used Twitter to varying degrees as well.

The post in question came about as I stood there in the White House watching the President take questions from people all around the country exclusively on Twitter. Then I thought about what the many people in 2006/2007/2008 who trashed the service as being pointless and something no one would ever use, would be thinking now.

The fact of the matter is that Twitter has become an extremely important service in the modern age. You can debate the degrees to which it has helped facilitate revolutionary actions, but there's no question that it has played an important role. And now it's fostering important political dialogue. What struck me most about the Twitter/White House event was the quality of the questions that came in.

That doesn't mean that Twitter has fully succeeded, of course. They do still need to figure out a viable business model that can sustain what they've built. But it would now be impossible to make the same arguments about the service that many were just a few years ago ? that it would never amount to anything. It already has.

And that's an important lesson for every startup that gets bashed for being something ""stupid"" that ""no one will use"". Sometimes it's those startups that have a chance to truly make a difference. By not fitting a mold, they can break others.

MG-Siegler,"TechCrunch traffic always dips on weekends. The overall numbers are constantly changing (rising), and there are exceptions, but generally I would say that most Saturdays see traffic that is roughly half of a normal weekday.

But it's important to note that there are two key factors here. There are less readers, it seems. But there are also less stories we post on weekend days. Still, I would bet that if we did post a full weekdays worth of posts (30-40) on a Saturday, traffic would still be down.

Sundays are typically better traffic-wise than Saturdays because people seem to start reading tech news again on Sunday night. Perhaps this is to get ready for the week or maybe it's because many companies like to time stories for this slot.

Friday afternoons, for what it's worth, are perhaps even more dead than weekends.

MG-Siegler,"To be honest, we're just trying it out. I can tell you firsthand that no deep Facebook partnership thinking went into this. We tend to do these kind of rollouts a lot with new technology when we're approached by companies and it sounds interesting.

In my view (one I know that a number of people at TechCrunch share), the core issue with comments on the web remains that the majority of people who leave them are either anonymous trolls or idiots looking to leverage your platform to draw attention to themselves.

Obviously, the level of absolutely ridiculous noise goes down quite a bit when the ability to comment anonymously is turned off. But even with something like Disqus, people can just create fake accounts. With Facebook, that's harder to do.

There are downsides, of course. We would have really liked for Twitter and Google to be a part of this ? but the sides apparently couldn't agree. So now Facebook and Yahoo are the only options. That's not ideal when people are at work and Facebook is banned, for example.

But we'll see. Is the troll trade-off worth losing those would-be commenters? Maybe, maybe not. Also, people can still easily create fake Twitter accounts, and we may have had the same issues.

But again, the core problem that no one has solved up until now is the complete and utter uselessness of comments as a site grows in size. People read Quora because it's useful. I can't remember the last time that the TechCrunch comment section was useful. But I'm sure it has been a long, long time.

But shouldn't it be useful? There's a great group of people reading everyday with a ton of knowledge. Why can't the comment section on TC be more like Quora?

I'm not saying Facebook has nailed this. And who knows, maybe we won't use it for very long. But something needs to change, and someone needs to step up with a better solution.

MG-Siegler,"I know some people think it's crazy due to the low margins, but I'm still betting on an actual TV. As in, a giant screen designed from the ground up by Apple. Obviously marked up to make it worth their time and effort.

Apple has so many ins now with component manufacturers -- including display manufacturers, that I think it's not only doable, but inevitable.

Steve Jobs has talked about how no one wants another set top box in their living room. While Apple was able to shrink the latest Apple TV so it's less of a box, it's still another separate device you have to control. I envision Apple creating an all-in-one system that simplifies the entire living room media situation.

Another reason I believe they'll do this is that consumers are willing to spend a lot of money in their living rooms. And just look at the options we have now. In terms of UI and UX, it's one giant across-the-board nightmare.

There are obviously some potential holdups here -- and they're big. The cable companies, first of all. They clearly would not want Apple anywhere near the TV set space. Why? Because it will mean the beginning of the end of their control with their awful cable boxes and over-priced content.

It could take some time. But I imagine this will come.

MG-Siegler,"It's absolutely fair. Everyone is all in a tizzy about "".X"" vs. ""X."" but Google and Apple simply (and obviously) don't view them the same way.

Does Apple roll out statues onto their lawn for each .X update? No. They don't say anything, with the exception of 4.2 because that unified the iPad with the iPhone.

Google uses their .X releases to pack in new features, new UI elements, and a ton of new APIs. Apple waits to do those until X. releases. Instead, their .X updates are mainly bug fixes.

As Adam Kazwell notes in this thread, I did point out that the only reason it perhaps was a little unfair was because 2.3 is very new. So perhaps 2.2 ? which has been around longer than iOS 4.0 ? is a better comparison then. But even that has a paltry 51.8%.

That's awful. And imagine how long it's going to take 2.3 to get there. At least 6 months. Probably more. Potentially a lot more given the current growth rate.

Obviously, most of this is not Google's fault. It's the damn carriers and OEMs. And that, in a nutshell, is the main problem I have with Android.

Long answer short, X. vs. .X is a meaningless argument. Just look at how Apple and Google treat their updates.

MG-Siegler,"Yeah, the situation is pretty gray at the moment. On one hand, you'd have to believe that Verizon/Apple wouldn't rope everyone into buying one expensive product, then turn around and launch an upgrade a few months later. Oh wait, that happens all the time :)

But really, this seems too high profile of a situation for the two companies to screw customers here. I would hope that if the iPhone 5 comes to Verizon in the Summer, there would be a heavily discounted version for customers who bought the iPhone 4 on the network.

Perhaps not the full subsidy, but maybe $100 more? Pure speculation there.

The other possibility, of course, is that the iPhone 5 will be AT&T-only at first. Though this would also be sort of a slap in the face to Verizon iPhone customers. And the latest rumors suggest the iPhone 5 could be a CDMA/GSM hybrid.

It is interesting that Apple would launch this version in February, and not just wait a few more months until the Summer (after years of waiting overall). But perhaps it's because they want to have the iPhone 4 as a cheaper alternative ($99) at that point on Verizon as well and keep things in line. Again, pure speculation there.

No matter the reasoning, I've had more than enough of AT&T and will happily jump over to Verizon the second I can.

First, understand your community. Ask them where they hang out online. Then it's a matter of employing creative strategy that can benefit your business's bottom line while also catering to the communities where they are visiting.

A generic question like this unfortunately doesn't have a ""one size fits all"" question, but there are many ways other ways to do this. Some general ideas include:

Creative content creation around the product
Blogger outreach, especially with free products for review
Customer evangelism programs, using current customers to be brand ambassadors for your product
Engagement with customers for marketing and customer service through the channels your audience and prospects are frequently visiting.

Hopefully this can give you some more direction on the types of things you can do to build awareness about your product.

A social business is an organization designed consciously around sociality and social tools, as a response to a changed world and the emergence of the social web, including social media, social networks, and a long list of other advances.

Enterprise 2.0 is generally used to represent the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies -- like cloud computing, social media, wikis, and the like -- and is, as such, principally a technology adoption issue, and not a reconceptualization of business operations.

  "
Stowe-Boyd,"Let's start by agreeing that the 2.0 meme has been played out.

I suggest we refer to these modern collaboration tools as work media: social tools designed for the enterprise but based on the patterns of interaction, influence, and communication from social networks of the open web.  Work media  tools  share a number of characteristics, most  centrally the streaming  metaphor  of Twitter and Facebook, with short updates from a variety of followed sources cascade into each user's dashboard, from which each can derive a networked gestalt of the world. Work media is altering the DNA of business.

The transition to liquid media -- where content is contextualized within streaming apps like Twitter, Flipboard, and News.me, instead of on web pages -- is not a fad. It is the next cycle of a fundamental transition into social media, and one that is moving past the superficial, earlier adoption and into a deeply socialized experience of information flow, based on social networks, not just alternative, low-cost publishing solutions.

And yes, this is a movement away from business processes as the primary metaphor of business operations in hierarchically organized companies, over to social network-based work and social network-organized companies. This is much more than a shift in scale, and very pragmatically, it is a shift to a way of work that is very well fitted to the time we are living in.

The adoption of work media in business will be profoundly transformative, and not just because of the shiny toys -- like tablets, and truly smart phones -- that are arriving at exactly the same time.

There are strong cognitive reasons that people naturally are adopting a stream/networked model of work communities. There are numerous studies (Meade, and many more recently) that demonstrate that people are happier and more productive, for example, when they share their immediate tasks and receive acknowledgment of progress made. In such settings, we perceive time moving faster, and the effort involved in work seems less. (See my writing on 'social cognition' for more on this.)

To the extent that we are capable of getting to a flow state in our work, it seems clear that the best tools are those structured according to the patterns of human interaction present when teams 'flow': helping us to keep relevant information in close context, to coordinate with team members, and for all to know what needs to be accomplished by who, for example. This requires tools in which we, those doing the work, are the principal sources of information, the principal sources of meaning: not the information we are exchanging, or even the company on whose behalf we are exchanging it.

Today, companies need solutions that foster trust in an increasingly free agent world, and especially the 'swift trust' that is necessary for short-term teams to come together quickly, accomplish a shared task, and then move on.

We need liquid media to deal with an increasingly slippery, uncertain world, and to -- paradoxically -- help ground us by keeping our heads above the churning surface exactly where the flow is at its fastest.

Ten years from now, we will have a strange sensation when we think about how work was accomplished 'in the old days.' We will look back on the work environment of the '00s and earlier, and wonder: how did we ever get anything done when our tools got in the way and divided us from ourselves?

Stowe-Boyd,"Meade and other researchers have shown that setting goals and noting progress made, people were happier, sensed time passing faster, and were more productive. As Robert Levin said in A Geography Of Time, ""Psychologists and planners have sometimes used the ?time flies? phenomenon to their advantage. In one project, for example, psychologist Robert Meade was able to improve workers? morale by speeding up the psychological clock. Meade took advantage of the fact that that time is experienced as shorter when people believe that they are making progress toward a goal. The sense of progress, he found, can be enhanced through simple procedures such as establishing a definite end point to the task and providing incentives to reach those goals.""

Socializing these activities through the use of streaming collaboration tools is an obvious approach (see Surrender To The Stream And Be Happy http://d.pr/cMSU ).

Stowe-Boyd,"Google needs to think about the next stage of the social revolution, not the last one (the one they sat out).

The next stage is the rise of the social operating system, where social connection is managed intrinsically, like today's operating environment's handle files, programs, and network connections.

What we have learned from the open social web is that it's all about people: people following each other; communicating; sending pictures, invitations, and love notes. We invented the web to happen to ourselves, not to create content.

So Google should push ahead with Android (and drop Chrome OS), building in the primitives that implement sociality. Then, they and other application developers can build on top of a social platform that is distributed, open, and not under the control of a single company. Our social metadata would reside on our hard drives (and cached in the cloud), controlled by us, not in the data farms owned by Facebook.

Yes, Twitter would be a great acquisition for Google in this regard, although they would have to rearchitect it to be a distributed, open solution, although with a very similar user experience to today's.

Instead of scrambling to build social apps, Google could be the first to lay a foundation for the social world.

I expect that Twitter's ambitions in making its own client software suggests they will -- sooner or later -- take a run at the social magazine niche, once the potential is really obvious. Perhaps an acquisition of Flipboard? Facebook could also build a tablet format social magazine, and drowning in cash, why wouldn't they?

Google should wade in immediately, since meaning is the new search: we will rely on our social connections to deliver meaningful insights to us instead of relying on search engines' indexing to find clues. But Google's social deafness has hampered them for years, so they will likely dither until the metaphor of social magazine has been well-established, and then they will build a sketchy knock-off using three people's 20% time, wait a few months and shut it down, and then acquire two social magazine start-ups for $50M, wait two years and then shut them down.

Stowe-Boyd,"I never warmed to Friendfeed, primarily because it seemed dominated by outsized personalities and their acolytes. As I wrote in Jan 2009 in Bottom Feeding Off Friendfeed (http://www.stoweboyd.com/post/82...
It may also be that the benefits of Friendfeed only accrue to very popular people ? like Gray and Scoble ? who have dozens or hundreds of acolytes who respond to their every post with a barrage of commentary. I will also suggest that those who are very active followers of those two and their ilk may also get a secondary, real and significant benefit as well. But the average schmoe, wandering around in Friendfeedland, having not perfected either massive social popularity or the followership model will try the service out and quickly leave never to return because there is no ?it? to get for them. There is no there there, as Gertrude Stein famously said of Oakland.

The difference with Quora seems to be the thematic approach. Instead of personalities dominating, in Quora issues dominate. This has the direct effect of drawing deeply knowledgeable people to jump into Quora discussions -- like having the founder of a startup answer questions about the company -- which reminds me of the Woody Allen bit from Annie Hall, when he's drawn into a discussion with a bombastic idiot at a cocktail party about Marshall McLuhan, and Allen pulls McLuhan out of thin air to refute the blowhard.
The dominant motif in Quora is the spirit of inquiry, a direct rejection of being a fan boy of highly popular media personalities. Quora is less like talk radio, where Howard Stern holds court on a dozen topics each show, and much more like reading -- and participating with -- the New Yorker or the Atlantic, where a diverse set of leading thinkers address the issues of the day.

LinkedIn often works, but remember to follow the rules above.

If you don't hear back, be persistent. Make sure to follow up, but don't be annoying - try to keep it at a ping once per week or so, and don't take it personally if the person doesn't respond at first.

Twitter often works too - mention the user in your tweet, and you may find yourself starting a conversation.

Twitter is one good way to do this but is too fleeting and doesn't allow folks to read more in depth information about this. They have a staff tumblr but obviously you wouldn't be able to reach that in the event of downtime.

I've been forced to use Postling to do a good deal of my blogging at Tumblr because of the limitations that the Tumblr dashboard currently has:

I can't import multiple RSS feeds, Twitter feeds, Facebook feeds, Flickr feeds etc into my dashboard to use for the basis of posts.
I can't manage multiple Tumblr account logins from a single dashboard unless they are sub-Tumblrs of the one I currently am logged into.

It's a validation that the New York Times wants to enter a space 2 years after we created it.

The ""follow,"" the ability to stay on top of a story over a long period of time without having to re-read the previous updates. Circa is actually writing stories, while NYTNow is aggregating bullet points with no conception of prior events and sending you to the long form you don't want to read on a phone.

We built a platform that makes it dead simple for anyone to get involved and passively send content to the place they live in the process of their own blogging. This makes it simple, low-friction and conducive to getting the people in the area involved without a ton of effort.

The old newspaper model that Patch is trying to re-build is expensive and unsustainable. The algorithm method that outsidein and others try to use doesn't provide a human voice and often pulls in the wrong neighborhoods. It's also mostly data, and people want stories. They want real content, not transcripts of city council meetings.

In the event of breaking news, it is much quicker and easier to update Tumblr than it is to get something to broadcast or to the main website, that has much stricter editorial processes and workflow.

Many major news outlets now have their own tumblrs, such as ABC News, MSNBC, and online outposts like Politico. Look for them on the Tumblr directory.

Twitter is limited to 140 characters, Tumblr allows for more rich media and additional room to describe breaking events. When something is happening, you'll often see many people covering it in real-time on Tumblr. Twitter is a good alerting system and jumping off point for getting small bits of information about the breaking events, I suggest looking at Rodrigo's advice, he's the best I know at covering and reporting breaking news on Twitter, as he co-founded the original @breakingnews account before it was sold to MSNBC.

Jennifer-Van-Grove,"Ben did a great job of answering that question, so here are my additional thoughts on the subject matter.

If you don't have the connections, your best bet is to send an email pitch to the right reporter (see Ben's point on knowing who to pitch).

The number of cold email pitches I receive far outnumbers the vetted-through-trusted-contacts ones. I don't treat each equally, but I will read each and every one (at least partially).

Here are some dos and don'ts on email pitches:

Your first few paragraphs should not be used to tell me how much you enjoy reading my work, that we may have crossed paths two years ago, that you're like X popular startup but for X industry, or that you think this is a great story idea for Mashable. Get to the point within the first few sentences.
Tell me what type of coverage you're looking for (launch, funding, new feature release etc) and for when (also good to put this in the subject line). Is there an embargo? Is this an exclusive? etc.
It's okay to pitch your startup when there isn't any specific news -- say for instance you launched six months ago and Mashable has yet to cover you. I will likely point you to our Bizspark series for profiling new startups and you can submit an application for consideration. I usually look through these 2 - 3 times a week, but emailing me directly to let me know you've submitted an application may help you cut the line.
Asking me to give you feedback on a site as a roundabout way to get my interest doesn't work. The average news day is a whirlwind affair of email, phone calls, demos and, of course, writing. I don't have time to look at your site and give you feedback (unless we're friends).
If I think your startup is worth a story, I'll either star it/label it and come back to it, tell you to submit to the Bizspark series, forward it to a colleague more suited for the story or pick it up immediately and follow up with you via phone or email for more on the backstory.
I will write up startups that have been picked up by other outlets, but linking to your New York Times or TechCrunch writeup when you're pitching me doesn't win you any bonus points. I want an original story, not an also-ran.
I have different expectations around pitches from PR people and ones from founders. I don't expect a founder to have a polished pitch and that's okay. I do expect tangible passion for their product and vision. I expect a more formulaic/seasoned pitch from a PR person.
You could break all the ""rules,"" but if you have a killer product, I will pick up the story.

Babak-Nivi,"Raise less if you want to keep your valuation down and keep the option open for an early exit where everyone (investors, employees and founders) makes money.

Raise more if you're here for the long term and you want to protect your company from poor funding environments or hiccups in your growth. Just try to maintain control, monitor your liquidation preference, and monitor your dilution. Also understand that, if your valuation is high in this round, you will have to make a lot of progress for the next round to be an up round.

In summary, raise too little money and you may go out of business when you run into trouble. Raise too much money and you may make less dough when you exit. Take your pick: disaster vs. dilution.

In either case, try to act like you don't have a lot of money. The conventional wisdom is that when you have a lot of money, it's hard not to slow down because you start spending it (which takes time in and of itself) and you start thinking that you have a lot of time left before you die, so what's the hurry?

Okay, so exactly how much money should you raise? 12-24 months of runway is a common answer. It gives you enough time to justify a valuation bump in the next round, make a lot of mistakes, and run a few radically different experiments.

But the answer is going to change if you're pre- or post- initial product/market fit. Pre-fit, it's impossibly hard to predict when you're going to be more valuable or what you need to do to be more valuable. After fit, it's merely insanely hard.

The answer is also going to change based on your team's skill at predicting things and leading the company to hit those predictions. Most of us are probably much worse at that than we think we are. So this argues for raising more.

Babak-Nivi,"Trending is based on indications of interest from candidates and investors. In other words, when a lot of highly-ranked candidates and investors say they want to meet your startup, in a short period of time, you trend.

The rank of the person that is indicating interest matters. Rank is measured by track record: the valuation of the startups a person has invested in, founded, worked at, etc.

Trending was previously based on receiving a large number of high-quality followers in a short period of time. It has been revised to reflect more useful signals.

Trending will probably become less important once the new General Solicitation rules allow us to show featured startups to non-investors.

The AngelList community helps you raise money on market terms, from the most value-add investors, fast. In short, AngelList is efficient.

Or, in other words, AngelList gets you answers to three questions:

How do I know what my shares are worth?
How do I know the girl/guy I'm marrying is the best one?
When is the deal closing?

Before I get into how the community answers these questions, let me say that, one, AngelList is free and, two, you can control exactly which investors in the community see your startup (http://venturehacks.com/articles...).

1. Market terms

How do I know what my shares are worth?

When you sell your car, do you go to Craigslist, or do you go knocking on doors? When you sell your action figures, do you use eBay, or do you throw a garage sale and offer your toys to one person at a time, over a timespan of 'whenever'?

You can't clear the market in series, you can only clear it in parallel. And the only way to clear the market is to go to the market. The best companies on AngelList end up raising money on better terms than they expected. It's impossible to get that outcome if you're meeting investors one-at-a-time.

""More than doubled the round size and significantly increased the pre-money."" ? Bertram Meyer, Taulia

""[AngelList helped] us close the existing deal more quickly and on better terms than we would have without the considerable additional investor interest generated by AngelList."" ? Sean Harper, FeeFighters

""We were over-subscribed not once but twice."" ? Gagan Biyani, Udemy

All quotes are from http://angel.co/reviews

2. Most value-add investors

How do I know the girl/guy I'm marrying is the best one?

Terms aren't everything. You also want investors who can add the most value. All the investors you know are probably on AngelList?but there's also a thousand other investors on AngelList that you don't know. It's highly likely that some of them have massive domain expertise in your market and you will want them involved in your company.

""[AngelList] adds people to the mix that would not be part of the offline deal sharing networks that already exist."" ? Fred Wilson, Union Square Ventures

""Not only did we receive high quality responses, they were from investors that had significant experience and insight into our specific vertical. These were angels that understood the market and quickly dove into the core strengths and weaknesses of the business and understood what needed to happen to get to the next level. Nowhere else will you be able to get a collective response from industry experts willing to help not only in terms of capital but from an operational and hands-on perspective as well."" ? Nikhil Sethi, Adaptly

""Your network only goes so far. As a NYC-based company, our ""reach"" into SF / SV investors was fairly limited. AngelList changed that. We have had dozens of investors contact us via AngelList."" ? Dave Lifson, Postling

""Most startups know about the ""famous"" investors ? those who have great public reputations or are name brands. But there are an amazing number of high quality angels, who fly below the radar, that AngelList gives you exposure to."" ? Anonymous

3. Fast

When is the deal closing?

On AngelList, you show your startup to all the investors that you want to meet at the same time. The investors know that, so they move fast. Even the investors you're already talking to know that, so they move fast. People sitting on the fence know the time for sitting on the fence is over. The best startups on AngelList start closing in days, not weeks.

""Within hours of posting, we had dozens of qualified, top-shelf investors and by the end of the day we were 100% oversubscribed."" ? Mark Risher, Impermium

""Investors I've been chasing around for months finally emailed me back. We got $50K committed in the first 10 minutes."" ? Anonymous

""By the weekend I had multiple term sheets and by Monday we had closed our round with exceptional investors that I could only dream about. There is simply no other way to raise a round so quickly."" ? Shafqat Islam, NewsCred

Bonus: Advice

Fundraising advice from the dudes who do Venture Hacks. We didn't think this was a big deal and we definitely don't want to toot our own horn too much, but this consistently comes up in customer development with gratified users (see http://angel.co/reviews).

""Nivi and Naval were both available to give me advice as we went around raising our ""party round"". For example, I remember having an idiosyncratic issue that I couldn't figure out, and Naval took a 20 minute call with me where he basically solved what two professors couldn't quite help me with (background: I was finishing up school while raising my round). The non-obvious value that AngelList has is that Nivi and Naval are like sherpas helping you scale the Mt. Everest that is fundraising."" ? Rafael Corrales, Learnboost

Summary

It's the difference between going door-to-door to sell vacuum cleaners and placing an ad on Google. One approach is a pain in the ass. The other is fast, easy, efficient.

Or think of it like this: you do everything else online, why wouldn't you raise your money online? You put your code on GitHub. You put your servers on Amazon. You buy customers on Google. You market on Twitter. And you can raise your money on AngelList.

If you have any questions about AngelList, send us an email at team-at-angel-co.

Frankly, the less you need AngelList, the more the community can do for you. That sounds surprising but it's not. The stronger you are, the better your terms will be, the better your investors will be, and the faster you'll close.

This is called effectiveness. Most of the answers on this thread are focused on efficiency. Peter Drucker: ?Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.?

Get great partners because you're not going to get much more efficient than you already are. Paul Graham: ?Get good cofounders. You can't change who you are, at least not in a short time.?

And realize that you're either working on the most important thing you should be doing right now or you're goofing off. They're both fine activities.

In short, don't worry too much about being more efficient. Do things where your poor efficiency won't get in the way of being awesome and get partners who will make you more productive. Also follow Andreessen's suggestions above.

Babak-Nivi,"I've been working with Jeff Fagnan at Atlas Venture since I dropped out of school in 2000. I wanted to get a job in VC (God knows why) and Jeff was crazy enough to hire me. Since then, I've worked with him as an Analyst and EIR. He also invested in 2 of my companies, 2 of my friend's companies, and my brother's company. And he supported me as an EIR while we started Venture Hacks. So I know him pretty well and I still work with him closely. He has been one of the great mentors of my life.

Here's what I tell every entrepreneur who asks me for a reference: ?You should take his money. Always take his money. It's an easy decision. He is entrepreneur friendly to a fault. And he works hard for the companies he invests in ? again, to a fault.?

I've also spent a little bit of time with Fred Destin at Atlas who is great. Read his blog to get a feel for his personality: http://www.freddestin.com

I've also had great experiences with Spark Capital (Alex Finkelstein is a friend) and great but limited experience with Hemant Taneja and Joel Cutler at General Catalyst.

There are a lot of great investors in Boston, Silicon Valley and the rest of the world. Get to know them before you raise money and pick the one that's right for you. Keep in mind that you're unlikely to make a good decision if you haven't done this before or you don't have great advisors. Don't make your decision based on brand or reputation alone.
  "
Babak-Nivi,"Raise less if you want to keep your valuation down and keep the option open for an early exit where everyone (investors, employees and founders) makes money.

Raise more if you're here for the long term and you want to protect your company from poor funding environments or hiccups in your growth. Just try to maintain control, monitor your liquidation preference, and monitor your dilution. Also understand that, if your valuation is high in this round, you will have to make a lot of progress for the next round to be an up round.

In summary, raise too little money and you may go out of business when you run into trouble. Raise too much money and you may make less dough when you exit. Take your pick: disaster vs. dilution.

In either case, try to act like you don't have a lot of money. The conventional wisdom is that when you have a lot of money, it's hard not to slow down because you start spending it (which takes time in and of itself) and you start thinking that you have a lot of time left before you die, so what's the hurry?

Okay, so exactly how much money should you raise? 12-24 months of runway is a common answer. It gives you enough time to justify a valuation bump in the next round, make a lot of mistakes, and run a few radically different experiments.

But the answer is going to change if you're pre- or post- initial product/market fit. Pre-fit, it's impossibly hard to predict when you're going to be more valuable or what you need to do to be more valuable. After fit, it's merely insanely hard.

The answer is also going to change based on your team's skill at predicting things and leading the company to hit those predictions. Most of us are probably much worse at that than we think we are. So this argues for raising more.

We also figured out how to set up Skype for free and easy telepresence. So someone can call our Mac and put their ugly face on the screen with absolutely no operator intervention on our end.

These instructions are for Skype for Mac 2.8. In the Preferences, turn on these settings:

""Auto-answer calls"" under Calls.
""Start my video automatically"" under Video.
""Keep call windows in front"" under Advanced (so you can see the video even if Skype wasn't the front-most window).
Set Energy Saver on the Mac to keep the display on for 3 hours (or indefinitely) ? Skype doesn't tell the Mac to turn on the display when it receives a call.
It's also not obvious how the caller can initiate a video call without making a voice call first. Here's how you do it: In the Chat window (Command-2 to bring it up), select a name from the drawer and click Video in the Toolbar at the top of the Chat window.

Some additional settings you should consider modifying:
Adjust the ""who can call me"" settings under Privacy and Video.
Turn on ""Start my video automatically"" under Video.
Turn off the screen saver entirely. When the screensaver is on, the caller can only initiate an audio call, he can't initiate a video call.
These instructions might seem complicated but you only have to set this up once.

Babak-Nivi,"Investors fall into two camps. Some think ""it's never been done before"" is a ding. Others think it's a compliment.

I'm not an investor, but I think it's a compliment. So market proof is irrelevant to me. But traction is paramount.
  "
Babak-Nivi,"Social proof is when you do something because other people are doing it. If you're walking down the street and everyone is looking up at the sky, you look up at the sky.

In this context, social proof is looking at what other investors, entrepreneurs, and advisors are doing. Customers don't count.

I'll disagree with Naval Ravikant on ""An investor is choosing not to invest in your company and is making the introduction for you"". I don't think this is as bad as he makes it out to be.

The primitive part of your brain will probably recoil when a peer sends you their rejects. But the logical part of your brain will ask why the investor is passing. And there's often a good reason: wrong market, wrong stage, wrong geography, bad chemistry with entrepreneur, some known risks that the investor doesn't want to take, etc.

Rejecting a deal just because a peer rejected it is mathematically unsound. Here's the proof. Every deal you ever invested in was probably rejected by a peer at around the same time you made the investment. So, if your criterion is that you will reject deals that peers reject, you will never make any investments.

Steve-Case-1,"A lot! I don't remember the total spending but do recall in the early 1990s our target was to spend 10% of lifetime revenue to get a new subscriber. At that time I believe the average subscriber life was about 25 months and revenue was about $350 so we spent about $35 to acquire subscribers. As we were able to lower the cost of disks/trial/etc we were able to ramp up marketing. (Plus, we knew Microsoft was coming and it was never going to be easier or cheaper to get market share.) When we went public in 1992 we had less than 200,000 subscribers; a decade later the number was in the 25 million range. That helped drive our market capitalization up from $70 million at the time of the IPO to $150 billion when we decided to combine with Time Warner to accelerate our transition to broadband and diversify our revenue mix.
  "
Steve-Case-1,"I am pleased that my Quora answers have been helpful to you and apparently to others as well. 

I am happy to contribute.  I signed up for Quora last Fall because I had heard about it and was intrigued.  I was initially reluctant to post answers, as I wasn't sure I wanted to add yet another social media responsibility to my repertoire.   But I jumped in the water a couple months ago and started answering some of the questions that had been posed to me.   I found it didn't take that much time, and my answers helped clarify some things (especially related to the early days of the Internet).   So I am now happy to check in every week or so, and will post when I think I can add something to the dialogue.

I have always enjoyed building and participating in the community aspects of the online medium.  Indeed, I started writing monthly ""letters from Steve"" to members of our online community 20+ years ago, and regularly posted on AOL message boards, especially in the early years.  I backed away as things got crazy, but reengaged via Twitter a couple years ago.   I run into a lot of people who I don't even know who say they get value from my tweets, and I hope the same is true with answers on Quora.  

I share the view that to whom much is given, much is expected. The Internet has been good to me (to say the least), and I am happy to give back.  My hope is that some of my perspectives might be useful to others (and in particular helpful to entrepreneurs building companies, as I want to be a champion of their efforts).  Plus, I am a sponge for knowledge, and I recognize I too can learn from participating.

Thanks for asking.

Steve-Case-1,"A good place to start is to learn from Teddy Roosevelt, who said this a century ago:

""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""
  "
Steve-Case-1,"The move to unlimited, all-you-can-eat pricing was a decision that was almost a year in the making - but the final decision came together over a weekend.  

We had done a lot of testing and research in late 1994 and early 1995 and it was clear that as more consumers embraced the Internet, and as we were able to build lower cost communications networks to drive down our costs, and as new revenue streams like advertising started to show promise, and as dozens of local ISPs (Internet Service Providers) emerged with flat rate prices, that we needed to shift to unlimited pricing.    The question was when, and how.   

It was a big, wrenching change that had lots of implications, so there was a lot of internal anxiety, as well as external concern among investors, partners, etc.   It came to a head over a weekend as Microsoft announced they were offering MSN on a flat rate basis, and it was clear they were planning to steal a lot of market share from AOL.   So I decided within hours of their announcement that we had to match them, and the company worked throughout a weekend so we could make an announcement.  

When we announced the shift (to $19.95 for unlimited use), a lot of investors bailed and the stock was under a lot of pressure, and as usage soared our customers became irate about busy signals - so some of the internal fears came to pass - but despite the difficult  transition, we knew it was the right thing to do, and we never looked back.  

That pricing decision, coupled with a series of acquisitions and products to position AOL as ""the Internet and a whole lot more"" (in other words, we provided full access to the Internet plus a wide range of services that were exclusive to AOL members) led to unprecedented growth for AOL in the late 1990s.
  "
Steve-Case-1,"AOL was very successful in the 1990s in building a significant brand, audience, and market capitalization.   Indeed, a decade ago it was the most valuable Internet company and one of the most valuable companies in the world.   That enabled us to merge with Time Warner in a deal that gave AOL shareholders 55% ownership of a company that had nearly $40 billion in revenue and almost $10 billion in EBITDA.    The problem was not AOL having a large number of users - that was clearly a big advantage and asset (much as it is today for Google, Facebook, etc) - it was that the management of the combined AOL Time Warner was unable to capitalize on the opportunities that existed to innovate and build more value.   As Marlon Brando said in On The Waterfront, it could've been a contender!   But as Thomas Edison noted a century ago, vision without execution is hallucination.  That, sadly, is the AOL/Time Warner merger in a nutshell.

Christine-Lu,"The short answer is:

How the China promo video is generally viewed in America depends on who is viewing the China promo video in America.

If we're talking Americans, then it'll be interesting to hear the diverse points of view on this answer. Some will see it as a tourist promo video. Others may see it as China being in our face about being a rising power. And many will have a bunch of stuff in between.

The not so short answer is:

I personally don't think this promo video was made for an American point of view to begin with. Who aside from Yao Ming do most Americans recognize in that clip? If it was made for Americans, they would have included a lot more cliches to make us feel warm and fuzzy about visiting China. Panda bears, the Great Wall of China, smiling Chinese kids saying hello on camera and telling us to visit. You know, stuff like that. But this wasn't that kind of promo video.

When you factor in the timing and place of where the promo video debuted, I would say influencing Americans to visit China or think more positively of China came second to projecting China's ""soft power"" in America and giving the Chinese a lot of international ""face"" in the process.

The promo video debuted the same week that Hu Jintao was in the U.S. for an official state visit. Even though New York wasn't one Hu's stops, it is where the mainstream media is headquartered. Given the amount of attention that was already focused on China that week, this promo video in Times Square was another opportunity for media to talk about China's ""rising influence on the international stage"" during Hu's visit -- giving the Chinese lots of international face.

The promo video was covered in Chinese media during the week of Hu's visit also. This includes segments by Chinese media at Times Square interviewing Americans and international tourists about what they thought about the promo video. Being the polite westerners we are, when a Chinese film crew asks us what we think about a Chinese promo video, we're going to say nice things about China (even if most of us don't know who the heck any of those people are besides Yao Ming) and those nice things we say about China are going to end up being aired in Chinese media -- giving the Chinese lots of international face.

This last point is one that the mainstream media overlooked. The promo clip is set to play 300 times a day straight through Valentine's Day. Which also means it's going to play straight through the Chinese New Year. Since New York City is a popular destination for mainland Chinese tourists during Chinese New Year, get ready for groups of Chinese tourists taking pictures and videos in Times Square the next few weeks with that promo clip of China in the background. This is an excellent way for China to project China's image in front of Chinese citizens visiting the U.S. --  giving the Chinese lots of international face.

Christine-Lu,"My family and extended family in Taiwan goes back 400+ years. Based on my observation of their point of view, I don't see this happening peacefully. As Jacques Thesing points out, Taiwan may continue to grow closer to mainland China economically but that doesn't seem to translate to any increasing openness to give up their democratic freedom. Here in Los Angeles, the Taiwanese news channels and newspapers seem obsessed with covering Taiwanese domestic politics and the dialog and tone can get quite heated in relation to mainland China.

Even as I answer, just read that Taiwan tested missiles with President Ma Ying-jeou present. This on the eve of Hu's meeting with Obama. Granted, they're saying it's a coincidence because the date was set for the missile test before the date of Hu's visit to the U.S. was scheduled, but I still think going forward with the missile test shows that Taiwan feels politically confident in being able to exercise its right to do so.

Christine-Lu,"I think a good way to get more women involved in technology is to agree that we've debated enough about the fact that there are not enough women in technology and get realistic about the fact that funding a few more here and there or giving a few more board seats at companies with geeky names won't really have much of an impact beyond giving us all something to blog about and retweet.

So moving right along to how I think more women can get involved:

For women already in tech, I say drown out the noise of the debate and keep getting sh*t done. Your hustle and the results it produces is already an example in and of itself without having to get distracted by the recurring conversation, panel discussions and traffic generating blog posts. Some people might give thought to the fact that you're a woman. Some people might not. Those that do may be inspired. Those that don't really notice may just see you as another person who hustles and gets things done. It really shouldn't matter to you because you'll be too busy getting sh*t done.

For those covering tech, stop perpetuating the same tired debate and be part of the solution. I think we're beyond these recurring epiphanies that usually starts with a well meaning blogger, influencer or voice of reason having a ""Jerry Maguire moment"" and pointing out that there are no women in tech and then dragging the community into a ball of flames debate on who's to blame and why. Rather than write about why there are no women in tech, why not start profiling some awesome women already in tech? It might be harder to generate a linkbait headline out of that, but stories about people getting sh*t done can go a long way in inspiring others and contribute to actually making an impact.

For the community as a whole. I know this sounds a bit cynical, but I give up on trying to get more women of this current generation in tech. It's a waste of time to me if all it does is culminate into a train wreck of a panel at some TechCrunch event where a bunch of women are on stage yelling at each other and even getting b*tched at by the moderator while people in the audience and watching the live stream shake their heads. True story. Remember that? Sad to watch. A waste of time. Instead, I think our time is better served getting young girls in middle school, junior high and high school interested in technology. There are non-profit orgs out there such as Girls Inc. They've been around since 1864 trying to empower young girls and I'm sure they could use help and expertise from the tech community in creating new programs within their org that can help inspire more girls to get interested in technology. http://www.girlsinc.org

The guy is crazy busy. But then again, what sought after investor in Silicon Valley do you know who isn't? I think he's just more visible as in addition to investing he's known for his widely read blog posts, speaking, connecting and co-organizing events. But as you can see from the testimonials of those who have attended GOAP and the impact it's made, things get done and it's not by accident or a lack of time or involvement on his part.

A benefit I hear from other startup entrepreneurs of having Dave involved in your company -- aside from the funding, valuable insight and zero bullshit feedback -- is the access to a network of really amazing entrepreneurs, advisors and other
investors that he will generously connect you with who understand his
kind of crazy. Let's say for example, you go to him asking for something
 China related (my background and experience) when that email from Dave
hits my inbox and asks for my help in providing you -- a stranger to me --
with some of my time or an intro to a key contact in my network over

It's not going to happen and he's probably not the right kind of investor for you.

Christine-Lu,"With the assumption that we all know that China business is very relationship based, face to face, in-person meetings go a long way in showing you care about the relationship. In what ways?

Time. You took the time out of your schedule to make the initiative to meet with someone in person. Doesn't matter if you flew in from half way around the world or another part of town. The time taken shows that the person/company you are meeting is important.

Connection. You can't hand someone a business card. Share a meal. Have a casual exchange of ""getting to know you better"" type convo or feel as present and in the moment with someone via phone or video conference. To the extent that the meeting is important to your business, the results from being able to connect with key people in person will be much more effective in moving things forward in that business relationship.

Long Term. Meeting someone in person is a gesture that re-enforces to the person/company that the relationship is important to you and your company and you are serious about establishing a long term relationship as opposed to a short, transaction based one.

Limiting Lost In Translation. If you're a foreign company involved in business with the Chinese, it actually just seems more efficient to ensure important meetings among key people on both sides are done in person. Why? So that nothing gets lost in translation and turns into a big mess later. There are nuances that can be picked up between two parties in person that can't be conveyed via phone, email. This is important in developing trust.

Overall, this is a giving face issue and showing that you are keen on doing business in China with the Chinese on China's cultural terms. All of the above goes a long way in building trust.

In the U.S. we are so transaction based and focused on the deal. We are so used to being results driven that short, to the point conference calls or email threads with the whole world cc'd on it seems like a very efficient way of moving things forward.

In China quite frankly, they don't care about the deal or about you if they think you're an asshole who's only in it for the short term gain of cutting that one deal -- big or small. You can be as nice as you want on the phone and ask the about the weather but if you approach your business relationship in a way that involves a disregard for taking the time and initiative to meet in person, then it will definitely reflect on the results and how far you get in your business dealings in China.

Christine-Lu,"Lack of early adoption.
I tried to use it. I really did. But like other social apps, it's dependent on other people you want to use it with ...well, actually using it. After several weeks and as the buzz subsided (yes, I know Ashton Kutcher is an angel. so what) I found that none of my friends were signing up. If they did, they only posted one picture. That's not enough to keep me engaged.

ADD.
I have social app sharing fatigue. There's only so many places I want to regularly go to tell people what i'm doing. Show people what i'm doing. Or comment on what other people are doing. Instagram does much the same as Path. Sure one is open and other is private. But all Instagram has to do is add a feature that allows you to create private list and share certain pics with those people. They have the user base and traction to pull it off.

http://www.theatlantic.com/polit...

But a friend in Beijing writes to say that there may be a hidden logic
or silver lining to the rumor -- on Huntsman's side, if not on
Newsweek's. This friend is neither American nor Chinese, but he knows
Huntsman, and he deals every day with Chinese officialdom. In the haiku
eloquence of a tweet he writes:

>>That interview is going to raise JH's effectiveness as ambassador
exponentially with the Chinese.  The way they like to hedge....<<

Ie, there is nothing that will get the attention of the Zhongnanhai
leadership like the idea that the mere ambassador they are humoring
today might be back another day as a mighty American President. That
vague future possibility is already built in with Huntsman, but this
story, which Chinese officials won't be sure they can dismiss, should concentrate their minds.

Ryan-Sarver,"On the Twitter Platform team, we think of this in a few ways:

It's the joining of two, totally complementary platforms. One is a vertically integrated mobile OS, the other a horizontal social platform. There are around 200M iOS devices sold and Twitter has around 200M users, so there are huge opportunities for developers when combining the two user bases.

Lots of value for developers with very little code. Apple abstracts away the difficult parts, like doing OAuth signing and managing permissions/identity. We think developers will find the most value in:
Instant Personalization - One-click, instantly personalized experiences for users. Identity, single sign-on and social graph can be combined to create a really powerful, personalized and deeply social experience with little code.
Distribution / User Acquisition - Twitter is a great distribution channel. Tons of apps like Foursquare, Instagram and Quora have benefited from its effects and we think more iOS apps will learn to use it for that. Quora recently said they see, on average, 30 clicks back for every tweet a user sends from their thread pages. That's incredible traffic and leads to lots of new users and page views. This will translate to app downloads on iOS. We think it has the potential to be the second largest driver of app downloads next to the App Store.
  "
Ryan-Sarver,"As Zac says, it's more about the contract we have with the user. They entrust us with their content and we need to be good shepherds of that.

In order to do that, we need to have a direct relationship with developers and partners who are consuming Twitter content via the API to make sure they are playing by the rules -- and if they aren't, we need the ability to shut them off.

Obviously I'm not objective about this, but I'll make the argument anyway, because I've heard this question a few times, and while it's great for my ego, the conclusion that Lifehacker was good because I was there is just flawed.

Lifehacker's posts today are more thorough, more quickly published, include better art and more detailed screencasts and video segments than they ever did during my time there (from 2005-2009). They have a bigger staff and cover more beats than my staff did back in the day, too. See their very detailed coverage of all platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, the cloud. They're right on top of interesting and obscure nerd projects like running Android on an iPhone (or Hackintosh'ing OS X on a PC) as well as the new webapp du jour for doing something useful, day in and day out.

The difference between now and then is back then, the idea of ""life hacks"" was novel, geek productivity was a hot topic, and besides Merlin Mann's 43 Folders, Lifehacker was a whole new slant on tech. These days, GTD is no longer a revelation. The life hacks meme has cooled and seen dozens and dozens of blogs and books spring up around it. To grow its readership, Lifehacker has to target a more mainstream audience as well as geeks, and that can be a tough fence to straddle. It's really easy to lose a less tech-savvy person with one super-technical post, and lose passionate geeks with one oversimplification.

Lifehacker's main themes--productivity and approaches to it--haven't changed over the years, but the tools to achieve them have. So, for a long-time reader, it can feel like new posts are rehashes of old stuff. It's a challenge to write a site that caters to both new visitors and remains fresh and new to loyal visitors, and while it's not always perfect, the current editorial staff is doing a bang-up job-- better than I did in its first four years.

Gina-Trapani-1,"Not really, no.

The Nexus 7 is WiFi only. Google Maps works offline, if you download the area you're going to be in first. Walking and driving navigation are built in. But, turn-by-turn directions don't work well without a data connection. You'd have to manually progress from one step to the next by tapping the screen yourself. The device doesn't know where you are in the process.

Also worth noting, Maps are portrait-only on the Nexus 7, so even if you got a holder for it in your car, it would be more awkward than if it supported landscape.

Update: The Nexus 7 does have GPS, but turn by turn doesn't work well without a data connection, and maps are NOT portrait-only, I had my screen orientation lock on. Apologies.

But, just because you wrote in doesn't mean you'll get a writeup, or even a response. Lifehacker gets snowed in with tons of email every day, and they have to decide what to cover based on a variety of criteria at a lightning-fast speed. To get an idea of what our inbox looks like, a screenshot from 2008:


When I was at Lifehacker I was actively parsing hundreds of email messages a day. We would get so much email from people who pitch their thing as a life hack, but the editors don't necessarily agree. Just because something got written up on ""all the famous tech blogs out there"" doesn't mean LH will bite. They don't publish their criteria for choosing what to publish, but one guideline: they tend to focus on free apps. If there's a steep/required fee, that lessens your chances.

Andy-Carvin,"I'm not sure of its historical origin, but I wouldn't be surprised it's from the educational radio of the 50s and 60s. Either way, it's certainly passed down over the years within the culture of NPR and public radio in general. We've always prided ourselves on a delivery that's thoughtful, deliberate and clear, while not being rushed, or academic for that matter. You also won't hear us using a lot of fancy, multi-syllable words that are more common in newspapers and magazines; we really try to write our scripts so they come across as spoken English, not written English. A lot of people who work here grew up listening to NPR, and they've worked very hard to get their own pacing just right

We also offer training to on-air staff so they can work on their delivery. There's even a book called Sound Reporting, by longtime NPR producer Jonathan Kern, that talks about on-air delivery, including how reporters and hosts make notations on paper copies of their scripts to specify when they want to emphasize a word or syllable, pause for a beat, etc.

One of the biggest goals is intimacy. On many occasions I've heard my on-air NPR colleagues say they always try to speak as if they're talking to one person who's in the room with them, rather than to an audience of millions. And that intimacy comes through in their delivery.

Trust me, it's not easy. I've been on air many times to be interviewed, and I'm always comfortable with that, but the couple of times I've taken a crack at reading a script, I failed miserably. And I'm always in awe of the hosts when I'm in the studio with them, in terms of how they can take a script and read it so naturally.

Not because the phrase social media bothers me per se, but because I see the work I do as helping NPR achieve its mission of creating a more informed public through public engagement. And I think it's equally important for us to be engaging people offline as well as online, because our mission isn't limited to those people with broadband. Do we use a lot of social media tools in our work? Sure. But social media is just a means to a particular end, and only one part of that equation of achieving that end.

So does that make me a ""social media expert""? Who knows. I'd rather be known as a community organizer, both online and offline, and as a public advocate, empowering our supporters' ability to interact and collaborate with NPR, by whatever means they choose.

Andy-Carvin,"Tap water can be a concern, so try to stick with bottled water, including brushing your teeth. Anything that's uncooked can be a risk, or food that's been sitting out for a while. For example, if you order rice and it's not steaming hot, send it back. Raw fruits and veggies can be a problem, unless it's something you peel (like a banana) or you can wash it yourself. Eat a lot of yogurt, too; that'll help keep your stomach happy. I generally try to avoid salads and ice cubes, but I've strayed from that on occasion depending on the place I'm eating.

Even if you do this, you still may get sick; I've gotten sick once out of the four times I've been to India, and it wasn't fun. Try to bring along some rehydration packets to mix with water, so you don't get too dehydrated.

Andy-Carvin,"NPR produces some video content, but not enough to fill a 24/7 TV channel or stream. The capital costs of doing so would probably be prohibitively expensive.

Andy-Carvin,"I'm not sure of its historical origin, but I wouldn't be surprised it's from the educational radio of the 50s and 60s. Either way, it's certainly passed down over the years within the culture of NPR and public radio in general. We've always prided ourselves on a delivery that's thoughtful, deliberate and clear, while not being rushed, or academic for that matter. You also won't hear us using a lot of fancy, multi-syllable words that are more common in newspapers and magazines; we really try to write our scripts so they come across as spoken English, not written English. A lot of people who work here grew up listening to NPR, and they've worked very hard to get their own pacing just right

We also offer training to on-air staff so they can work on their delivery. There's even a book called Sound Reporting, by longtime NPR producer Jonathan Kern, that talks about on-air delivery, including how reporters and hosts make notations on paper copies of their scripts to specify when they want to emphasize a word or syllable, pause for a beat, etc.

One of the biggest goals is intimacy. On many occasions I've heard my on-air NPR colleagues say they always try to speak as if they're talking to one person who's in the room with them, rather than to an audience of millions. And that intimacy comes through in their delivery.

Trust me, it's not easy. I've been on air many times to be interviewed, and I'm always comfortable with that, but the couple of times I've taken a crack at reading a script, I failed miserably. And I'm always in awe of the hosts when I'm in the studio with them, in terms of how they can take a script and read it so naturally.

Going back over a hundred years to the research of Dewey and Vygotsky, there's a long line of pedagogy that stresses the importance of students being actively engaged in their learning - and asking questions is a fundamental building block. Sitting back passively and memorizing things by rote does little to help you understand concepts and build new knowledge out of them. To ask a question, you have to formulate it first, and that formulation is an integral part of the process of gaining a better understanding of a given subject.

C.C.. and I wrote this book as a field guide for those who understand that they need to be creating content as a cornerstone of their marketing, but then ask... ""Umm... but HOW?"" We interviewed and researched companies of all sizes and stripes, from the giant (Boeing) to the minuscule (the Cool Beans Group) to give ideas that any company could steal (which is how we frame it in the book!)

I know that sounds like a marketing pitch. But it's not: We've heard from all sorts of organizations -- from churches, rock bands, writers, and companies that sell anything from shovels to software -- who say as much. And by the way, we've also heard from folks who are seasoned content creators (who we NEVER thought would get much out of the book). And gues what? They do.

Edward-Boches,"I get asked a lot how it is that Mullen transformed itself over the last couple of years, evolving from a ?traditional? ad agency into a firm that blends digital, social, media, creative, mobile and DR in a way that actually works, albeit with a bit of occasional tension and pain.

Here are what I believe has worked for us:

A philosophy summed up in a single word:  Unbound

It was at an offsite a few years ago when our management team challenged itself to re-invent the company for a future filled with all kinds of changes ? technology, social media, consumer behavior.  We came up with the word Unbound to declare that we would not be restricted by our past, by the conventions of advertising,  or even by our current skill set.  Instead we would embrace ? even more aggressively than we already had ? the idea that the answer to how we build a client?s business wasn?t necessarily advertising. It might be a new product, or the way we gather a community, or how we construct new tools, apps and platforms.

An obvious emphasis on talent

We made an aggressive investment in new talent and got out of their
way. We brought in a new ECD, now CCO.  We hired a new leader for our
account group. We added experience in our analytics group. We also
created bigger opportunities for our existing stars. One of our key criteria was how hungry they were. Those of us who?d built the company from a small regional boutique into a national agency knew how far determination and passion can take a company. We wanted the same qualities in the next generation of leaders.

A relentless focus on the work

It should go without saying, but the fact is that everything from deadlines to approvals to expediency can get in the way of a relentless focus on great work. But Mark Wenneker, the agency?s creative leader, has taken the work up more than a few notches and more importantly gotten the entire company aligned with the mission.  We?re not where we ideally want to be, but anyone who?s any good never is.  The fact that creativity, in all of its manifestations, has the organization?s collective attention is likely to yield even better work in the coming year.

A willingness to push responsibility down

Mullen has always prided itself on a culture of ?collective entrepreneurialism,? an oxymoron I coined years ago to describe our culture. When you?re a small company it?s a lot easier to recruit people who share the same mindset.  The best way to find out of folks still have that quality is to give them rights and responsibility then hold them to it.  The best people want that, even demand it, and the benefits to both clients and the agency are quickly apparent.

An environment that forces collisions

I can?t put enough emphasis on this. When we moved to Boston we  intentionally designed an open environment that forced people to crash into each other. More importantly, despite three floors and multiple  departments, we embedded a broad range of capabilities in the creative group, including social, connection planning, mobile, tech, UX, digital design and production.  It helped foster a new kind of team, more diverse working sessions and an increased respect and understanding for every discipline.

A openness to experimentation

Finally, we made a commitment to trying more things for ourselves, in anticipation of client needs. John Moore, our media chief, built an emerging media lab and filled it with every new gadget, technology and platform. We created projects and reasons for everyone in the company to embrace social media, conceiving Brand Bowl (originally Trash Talk from the Twitter Section, which introduced much of the advertising industry to Twitter), turning our own site into a blog open to all employees, and experimenting with crowdsourcing.

Edward-Boches,"I think you need a combination of tools.  Radian6 and or Techrigy for conversation and sentiment if you value any of  the automated services.  Google for sure.  Postrank and webtrends are useful for tracking.  Visible measures and Quantcast for analytics.  And, of course, Facebook can give you lots of stuff on engagement and even churn, should your conversation strategy drive people away. But you really need custom metrics and dashboards so that you can track and measure what matters most to you.
  "
Edward-Boches,"Simpler answer.
Strategist (objectives, conversation strategy, tools, integration)
Content (writer and videographers and bloggers who generate content and interact with community)
Community manager (if you are maintaining a community for crowdsourcing, interaction, mobliization, participation, they need to be loved, rewarded, connected, etc.)
Tech/developer (if you accept the fact that social is connected to everything on the web you need people who know how to build things, do light weight development and use all the APIs)
Analytics (preferably someone good who can customize models)
Mobile (there's no social anymore that isn't mobile, so have someone who knows the tech, apps and LBS)


But the real answer is that everyone in a marketing or creative department everyone needs to be social in some way or another.  T-shaped people.  Yes there are specific skills and roles, but social is a culture and a brand behavior not a function.
  "
Edward-Boches,"Great lists but in some ways a narrow view of social media. I would agree with Shirky, add Jaron Lanier, Douglas Rushkoff, Iain Tait, Bob Garfield, Tim Brown, Faris Yakob, Sheena Matheiken, Lisa Gansky,  and others from the fringe who use it to actually do something *other* than social media. The people on this list above (Jason, Chris, DM, et al) are all great but there are many other voices who are saying (and demonstrating) interesting ideas/accomplishments.
  "
Edward-Boches,"Social strategy. Digital strategy. Connection strategy. Mobile strategy. User strategy. They are all just words. Eventually there will just be marketing strategy.  Or even just strategy. People will still need to know the tools, but more importantly they will need to understand human behavior and people's relationships to content, media, technology and each other, and then determine if the best way to connect and influence is via message or engagement,  contextual experiences, platforms that become essential to people's daily lives because they offer genuine utility, gaming dynamics or simply ways that invite a consumer's participation and partnership. All of that -- the insight that drives it, the behavior, the content, the idea, the creative execution -- is all social by definition, but it's bigger than that, too.  Right now SoMe strat is useful, as others have suggested, when it's necessary to distinguish between old ways of doing things and newer ways. But eventually the labels will change again.  We'll have Quora strategists, perhaps, advising clients on how to provide answers that will generate brand preference and loyalty.
  "
Edward-Boches,"Re tweets are only valuable if they are re-tweeted by people with many followers who actually pay attention to them.  Otherwise no value at all.  Also depends on whether you are looking to A. make yourself look good on Klout or Twitter Grader, or B. spread content for a blog post and or a cause/client/product you want to support.

As for @replies, they are totally different.  They not only give you answers, but again, depending on the person who @'s you, it may call attention to you, your content and also reveal who pays attention to you.

All depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Not sure I would spend time attempting to achieve either.  Just be authentic and engage.
  "
Edward-Boches,"I think the key finding lies in the industry's. Tech is high in trust. Finance and banking low.  No surprise given recent events, but they have always been low.  Why?  NO transparency.  Little value add.  The way they treat customers.  Clearly trust is not only more and more important as a brand attribute, but there is far more opportunity for both individual consumers to determine worthiness but also for companies to generate greater good will through engagement, honesty, sharing and inviting real participation, not superficial.  It is the end of us and them.  The barriers have come down. Learn to live with it and embrace the new rules or run the risks of missed opportunity to connect with customers and prospects.
  "
Edward-Boches,"First of all, if you are using your personal influence for a client you must always reveal that.  Even in a tweet.  I usually just add (client) in parenthesis. Secondly, whatever reputation you have is likely to be diminished (I won't name names but it happens frequently among those of us able to recognize who's tweeting for cash) if you do do it.  Third, there's a right and wrong way.  If you have a client that gets accolades for an achievement, it's OK to call it out.  If you notice someone on Twitter with a problem for which a client product can offer a solution, why not share the suggestion?  With the proper disclaimer, of course.  And finally, you should take advantage of the influence, which ideally you have earned for all the value you add to the community, and apply it. That is, after all, no different than your contacts in the press,  your relationship with film directors, your access to creative talent.  It's your currency and value. So use it, but protect it, too.
  "
Edward-Boches,"In some cases it may be from people who engage with you on other networks but you don't realize it. Or it might be people who actually want to connect with you.  The problem is that Twitter isn't the same as Foursquare and Gowalla.  You may want to answer or be asked on the former, but not necessarily tracked down or identified in the latter.
  "
Edward-Boches,"Not at all. Sharing is a new business model.  It's not about the idiocy of telling you what I had for breakfast. But look at what's happening on the business front.  Best Buy has an entire business philosophy of sharing everything they know. They are building a business that way.  OK Cupid shares the techniques, tactics, profiles and photos that work most effectively, thereby adding real value to its users.  So, brands are finding value in sharing.  Two, Patients Like Me are creating social good and possibly enabling patients to help doctors serve them better by willingly sharing their disease progress.  Was once a pretty private thing, but there is huge value in the collective knowledge.  Online we share our knowledge, links, content and ideas.  It connects us to others with whom we can debate, from whom we can learn, with whom we can grow.  Not to mention it adds to one's own reputation and credibility, leading, perhaps, to new business.  If you're questioning the idea of sharing too much, you may be limiting your interpretation of the word. Sharing is the future.
  "
Edward-Boches,"No. So far they are two very different platforms.  The utility of Twitter far exceeds that of Quora because of how users can take advantage of it, customize it and use the many tools developed for it.  Also, Quora is quite time consuming and Twitter is more instant and accessible. Quora also needs some real UX help.  Klugy interface.
  "
Edward-Boches,"There are three fundamental measures:  Awareness and engagement; Sentiment; Traffic and Transactions.  There are numerous off the shelf tools to measure the first two, but you need a custom analytics team to put together the third.  More importantly is that you should not be thinking like a traditional marketer,.  Too many people measure reach only, followers only, re-tweets only.  None of that matters. What really matters is did you learn from listening?  Were you welcomed by a community that you can activate on your behalf?  Did you find a more efficient way to deliver service?  Are you mobilizing (through utility and content) more people to tell your story for you? Remember that anything worth doing is worth measuring.  And that a goal without a plan is just a wish.
  "
Edward-Boches,"Old Spice was brilliant, but a short-term, one-time campaign. Better examples are Best Buy Twelpforce; Zappos and Tony Hsieh for engagement; Jet Blue service.  Or other angles such as MadMen avatars. Then again, there's always our own BrandBowl, the first Twitter Superbowl Party. Coming again this February 6.
  "
Edward-Boches,"There is no one answer to this.  What matters more is less the function or department but the kind of person.  Needs to understand the company and its business model; be tuned in to customers and their use of social, tech and media; have a basic knowledge of community management; and, of course, the confidence of the company leaders to speak for the organization in realtime.  Now, that being said, we're talking more about ongoing engagement. Depending on whether you're an airline, an online retailer, a new model ""mesh"" company, an educational institution, you'll have to factor in a number of other considerations including: what are you trying to do; with whom do you want to engage; what kind of utility and content can you bring to bear; what are you trying to learn; etc.

Social media is not a single practice or tactic. It is a mindset that can be applied to any and every type of business.
  "
Edward-Boches,"It's not Twitter's problem. It's yours. The beauty of Twitter is the network effect.   Users do the work and create the content.  Brilliant model and also good for you.  So learn the tools (list management, Tweetdeck, etc.) Go to oneforty.com for more ideas on tools then begin discovering.  Follow people followed by those you admire and slowly build your own filters.  They will be far more valuable than if Twitter does for you.

Dharmesh-Shah,"Disclosure: Drew's a long-time friend.  He's an advisor to my company HubSpot, and I'm an investor in Dropbox.

My short answer: No.

Longer answer:

1. The marginal value of the money he'd receive from a sale diminishes quickly.  (The first $5-$10M an entrepreneur makes has a big impact, but starts to decline quickly after that).  In other words, he doesn't need the money.

2. In the event he has early investors that need to exit, he can swap them out with later-stage investors.  I dont' think Dropbox has any trouble with access to capital.

3. Even if he had another great idea like Dropbox, it will likely take 5-10 years to get to this kind of scale again.  Those early years are fun and educational the first time, but entrepreneurs often don't have the patience for that the second time around.  It's quite fun playing the higher stakes game, and it's hard to go back to smaller stakes again.

4. He's actually a great CEO. One of the best I've met. So, he doesn't *need* to exit.  (This is not true of all CEOs of successful startups -- some just hit a wall and are better off selling).

5. Markets change -- quickly.  I think it's short-sighted to think of Dropbox as ""just"" a cloud storage company.  Just like it was short-sighted to think of Apple back in the day as ""just"" a computer company.  Competition increases -- but so does future opportunity. 

And, most importantly:

6. Best I can tell, he's having fun is still intellectually challenged and learning new things. Few get to where Drew has gotten -- even fewer get to where he can still go.  You don't get many chances like that in life.  Regardless of how things turn out, I doubt he would regret having taken the chance and betting on himself.

So, if you sell a $1,000/month product, and a rep sells 10 new customers a month, on average, your productivity per rep is $10k / MRR
  "
Dharmesh-Shah,"As Jason M. Lemkin said, it depends.

Here are some of the things it depends on:

1. Access to capital:  If you go after SMB, it's going to consume some cash -- so you're more likely to need venture capital to fund the growth (revenues come in over time).

2. Industry:  Some industries are harder than others to build an SMB business in.  For example, creating an analytics company in SMB is relatively hard.

3. Competition:  If an incumbent  has access to an enterprise sales team (often the case when going after Fortune 100), it's harder to break-in.  SMB is often easier to crack into.

Dharmesh-Shah,"HubSpot was started because the founders (I am one of them) observed that a big shift had occurred in how humans lived, worked and shopped. The traditional marketing methods were no longer as effective.

We built HubSpot to help organizations take a new approach to marketing -- one that was centered around people.  We called this new approach inbound marketing.

Some milestones:

1. The Inbound Marketing Book (Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media, and Blogs) was published in 2009 and was a runaway hit.  Has been translated into many languages and continues to help thousands.

2. In summer, 2013, the INBOUND event, hosted by HubSpot and held in Boston had over 5,500 people register.

Dharmesh-Shah,"I love Jason M. Lemkin's response, but will provide some arguments for keeping your low-end plan:

1. As you grow, if you're in an attractive market, you're going to attract some disrupters.  Almost always, these will come in through the bottom.  So, keeping your low-end tier, to some degree, provides defense.  Makes it harder for someone to attack you from below.  Not impossible, but harder.  For an example of this low-end defense, check out CRM and Cloud Computing To Grow Your Business - Salesforce.com.

2. If you end up looking at potential technology partnerships (i.e. people build on your API), the customer count matters.  Even though *you* may not derive much economic value from these lower-tier customers, your partners may find them attractive.  Will certainly get your more attention.

3. You may find that having that lower-tier and customer count helps you attract and retain better development talent.  Many people would rather work on a product that has 100,000 users than 10,000 users (even though revenue may be the same).  It's just more gratifying.

4. If you're in the game long enough, you may find that the actual *people* that are in your lower-tier segments end up changing jobs and becoming customers again at their new company.  And, that new company may be a much higher value customer.

Dharmesh-Shah,"I'm biased (I'm co-founder/CTO of HubSpot), but I'm also a developer/hacker type myself.

A few quick points:

1. One of the common reasons for startup failure is an ability to get customers.  On of the leading reasons for failing to get customers is to discount marketing under the hope that ""if we just build a great product, we don't need marketing"".  Though that is true in some cases, it's very, very rare.

2. More important than buying HubSpot (or buying any marketing software) is believing in inbound marketing -- i.e. creating value and focusing on the humans.  Too many venture-backed startups take the ""easy"" way and spend their dollars on advertising and buying lists of ""qualified prospects"" and emailing them. This is sub-optimal.

3. He needs to talk to folks he knows/trusts and get honest advice.  This could be the new investors -- or folks like Dave McClure who know a thing or two about startups -- and the importance of marketing.

Best wishes.
  "
Dharmesh-Shah,"Here are some of the bigger ones:

1. The startup doesn't have a product that's ready to sell yet.

2. The sales person cares too much about themselves and not enough about the customer.

I'm not going to answer specifically on my behalf (that would be immodest), so instead, I'll answer based on some of the great software entrepreneurs I've spent time with -- like Drew Houston, from Dropbox.

What makes folks like Drew so successful is that they are great technologists (have a passion for creating software) but also an intellectual curiosity about business and markets.  They like the abstract things like algorithms and data structures -- but also like concrete things like how to recruit people, build a brand, etc.

Dharmesh-Shah,"When HubSpot was started (while my co-founder and I were still in grad school at MIT), the idea was to create an ""Oracle for small business"" (integrating various applications like project management, time and billing, marketing and CRM).

Relatively early in our history, we shifted the focus to marketing for a couple of reasons:  1) We had very strong interest in that part of the application 2) We recognized that there was a big problem in the marketing software industry.  The big problem was that though there were many great individual ""point products"" that solved a piece of the problem, there was nobody that was building an integrated platform for marketing.  We decided to build that platform.

1. My co-founder and I are passionate about growing the Boston tech scene and have been for a while.

2. HubSpotters are pretty plugged in to the local tech community.  Hard to find an event where someone from HubSpot is not present.

3. We've raised a bunch of venture capital ($60 million+).  That always gets people talking.

Or, it could just be that we're really good at marketing and this is all just one great big super-successful branding campaign.  :)

Dharmesh-Shah,"I don't know what the answer is, but the number is trending smaller and smaller.  The center of gravity for the tech scene is moving to Boston/Cambridge.
  "
Dharmesh-Shah,"I don't think it's purely a function of price.  I think the answer is likely a function of price, product complexity and maturity of the market.  More complex products (even those at a relatively low price) might require human sales assistance.  Immature markets, where customers have to be educated, likely require humans more often too.

Having said that, if I were to make an educated guess, I'd say that somewhere around $100/month initial price likely requires *some* selling.  The way many SaaS companies overcome this (that have humanless sales) is to make the pricing ""variable"".  So, the starting price might be relatively low, but goes up based on value/consumption.  That way, you can ""ease"" into higher price points while still keeping humans to a minimum.

Then I scanned the list and thought ""Hey, those are a lot of the same people who have always been writing quality answers on Quora... I've followed them for a couple of years now.""

Then I started thinking ""I'm so not going through 500+ people to figure out who someone else thinks I should be reading when I don't even know what the criteria used was... Hmm. I should hunt down the criteria.""

Then after it settled in, I thought, 'oh honestly, it's like the damned Twitter checkmark - who cares? Either I write something useful to someone, or I don't. Doesn't make a difference whether I have a t-shirt or a plume-thingy.'

  "
Lucretia-M-Pruitt,"My gut response to this was ""cue running away and ending up a teenage mother whose abusive boyfriend regularly reminds her of her Dad in 5... 4... 3... 2...""

1) Firstly, if the guy is in IT as he claims? He's seriously ignorant of how the digital world currently works. He shot her computer so she might not see it until she's paid him for the computer and bought her own? Umm... No. She'll see it within the first 5 mins she's around a friend with a smart phone, or at the school where they have public computers in the library, or at study hall on the laptop of a friend. In fact, she probably saw it within minutes of his posting it.

2) This was a Dad's very public temper tantrum. Look at the methodology and see what was done versus stated goals.
He wanted her to quit posting what he considered disrespectful, angry posts about her parents on FB. He attempted to achieve that by posting an even angrier, discompassionate, retaliatory video on FB.
He wanted her to value the things her parents had given her (laptop and he mentions phone & digital camera) and the effort and time they put into helping her (1/2 day upgrading laptop, installing $130 software.) He tried to impart that by  devaluing the efforts she complained were unappreciated (chores, help around clinic) by saying they were far less than she said and nothing compared to what he did at her age. Then he destroyed (by shooting) one of the items she was supposed to appreciate, the laptop - thereby showing his own lack of appreciation for it.
He wanted her friends to quit supporting her on her FB page when she wrote things that were so negative about her parents - he gave them every reason to believe that her picture of him as a lazy, unappreciative, irrational parent was accurate.

3) The gun is violent, and particularly so if you have ever been female and subjected to a sociopath with a gun.  Just taking it out sends the message loud and clear about not getting out of line. ""Oh seriously!"" says the rational person ""Surely she didn't think he wanted to use the gun on her - it was just a dramatic way of denying her the laptop!"" Yes. Seriously. The point of bringing it out is to leave in her mind the image ""this could be you... If you step out of line too far..."" and it works.  If it were just the object? Why mention the cell phone and camera that are being confiscated? Why not shoot them too? Because, as years of ""loan shark muscle"" could tell you, the hint of violence usually generates enough fear to get compliance.

The sad part is that I honestly believe he'd like for the outcome of this to be the exact opposite of what it was.  But he doesn't have the tools to fix it himself and unfortunately, the Internet masses have spoken and applauded his grand dramatic scene.

If he wanted the things he says he wanted?
Print the letter out. Delete it from her timeline and change the password to her account. (Please tell me IT guy knows the importance of having her password.)
Sit down with her and anyone else that needs to be at the table and say ""Wow. This is a very angry letter and clearly you think there are issues we need to address here. But first, why did you post it to FB and try to block us from seeing it? Why write a letter called 'To My Parents' but then show it to everyone but hem?""
Discuss her concerns point by point -- 'she's a cleaning lady, not some sort of subservient maid of yours' and 'we don't ask you to make all of the beds, just yours and occasionally the guest bed' and 'but you are paid, it's just not in cash... You receive rent & board that would cost someone outside the family considerably more than he could make doing what you do. You receive things like laptops and phones and airtime that he'd also have to pay for on his own.  Money is a symbol of what it can get for you. Here, you get way more ""payment"" than you could if you were an outsider.""
Tell her that the way to effectively resolve familial conflicts is to discuss them inside the family. Explain that the Facebook post was inappropriate and had been taken down and her account password changed until she truly understood why that was the wrong approach which would be the requirement to earn it back.
Outline what will happen if it occurs again, if she tries to ircumvent the punishment by setting up a fake account and gets caught, or if she continues to project the attitude that none of this is her fault.


Hannah had some good possible teaching points there. He did not just shoot the laptop, ?he shot and destroyed her trust.  That mess will take years. *sigh*

Lucretia-M-Pruitt,"I'll add a couple of my must sees:

The Ring (1927) - one of Hitchcock's silent films, predates his jump over the pond to work in Hollywood - this one is all British. Which fortunately leaves us with a few less awkward cue cards and quite a bit more visual interpretation. Hitch's use of visual symbolism pops up through out the whole film. It foreshadows his future use of symbolism and shadow/light imagery that make his films such a feast for the eye.  The title might refer to the boxing ring, the wedding ring, or the bracelet of rings given to the woman in this love triangle - but either way, the camera moves, perspective and symbolism are pure Hitch and worth sitting through the silent film with a simple story. You can see the future Hitch we all know and love and see how he developed that style.



Metropolis (1927)

Fritz Lang's brilliant masterpiece is so integral to how we view the evolution of film - but most people don't realize that this was a German film.  In the middle of the post-WWI Weimar Republic, with it's extremism from communism, socialism, imperialism, and very little agreement on the right & left except when it came to feeling like the treaty of Versailles had put them forever under the thumb of its neighbors - this is a stunning exploration of the class struggle and social strife.
Whether or not the story is interesting (the symbolism of workers living below the city in the dark and the privileged elite living in the utopia is just a touch heavy-handed) the stunning Art Deco futurism is enough to keep you entranced. This is the movie that leads to the SciFi and dystopian classics like Bladerunner. It's a visual tour de force.



The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989) - with a caveat that there's some instances and imagery that are not for the faint of heart (cannibalism, violence, etc) it's still the movie that made me fall in love with Helen Mirren and 22 years later I'm still amazed at the visual masterpiece Peter Greenaway managed to create. His use of color was as stunning as Hitchcock's use of light & shadow.

Obviously I'm rather fond of visual masterpieces.  I'd add more, but I think the other answers here have already done such an excellent job that it's unneeded.  These were just the 3 films that came to mind.

Lucretia-M-Pruitt,"I don't have any stats (yet) either. But from my own anecdotal experiences, I'd say that G+ may have drawn some users away from Quora.  While the early adopters surge from new-thing to new-thing, the core users of a site are those who find a particular 'new-thing' compelling.

At the time Quora hit its open-to-any-user wave of people following the early adopters to yet another 'new-thing', the primary alternatives were things like Twitter & Facebook (short-form media), Wikipedia (historically accurate v. requiring insight or opinion), and blogging (requires the writer to find the audience and get them back to his/her site vs. coming to a built-in community of others with specific interests.)

If Quora has a weak point, it's that the concept of editing or having your own words edited for clarity and usability is not inherently friendly.  It's the red ink pen your high school teacher used that you thought you'd never see again.

However, that weak point is also one of its strong points - so it's not going to go anywhere.  If you can't edit something, you can't improve it.  If you can't moderate an environment, you can't make it useful for those who will willingly subject their writing to critique.

Google+ allows the longer form writing that appeals to Quorites, has the built-community (with simple network expansion), doesn't have the editing, and has no perceived moderation. (Although the real-name issue clearly shows that there are rules and enforcers - they're just well camouflaged.)

I would say that Quora has lost a number of casual users to Google+ but there may be some backlash down the road when the 'general public' discovers the issues with massive, open-walled, seemingly limitless opportunity for conversation.  Some will end up here because they value the higher level of engagement on the subject matter rather than on the person discussing it.
  "
Lucretia-M-Pruitt,"Simply put? No.

The phrase becomes ""a whole other"" the article changes based on pronunciation. You have the phrase ""an other"" which already mutated into the word ""another"" (yes, I see the irony of using already in this sentence.) if you wish to split the words into a phrase and insert a modifier? The article either stays ""an"" or becomes ""a"" depending on the pronunciation of the adjective you use. The word ""whole"" requires the change to ""a"" but the word following that is ""other"" not ""nother"" despite evidence of colloquial use. 

Just as words like ""ain't"" and ""orientate"" have gotten into the dictionaries due to linguistic surrender? The word ""nother"" may have. But if you cannot find usage of the word ""nother"" outside of this particular abuse? It's not ""correct English."" Try replacing ""other"" with ""nother"" in a different phrase and you'll find yourself using either ""another"" or ""other.""

Adam-DAngelo,"While I was in college I made a prototype of a chat website. I wrote the long polling server in Erlang because it seemed like the ideal language for the task and also as a chance to have fun learning a new language.

I then worked on the initial Facebook chat prototype as part of a hackathon project in early 2007, along with Anonymous and Ari Steinberg. I reused some of the Erlang code from my personal project. When we decided to make it an official project and productionalize the server code, the team decided to stick with Erlang and took over the code from there.

The rationale was something like:
We already have a working prototype to start from.
Erlang is good at holding a ton of open connections, which is the hardest part of a chat service.
Erlang is easy to learn, even though very few engineers already know it.

The last point, lack of expertise, is a real weakness of the language, but it was outweighed by other factors at the time. Ultimately it contributed to Facebook's decision to move the service to C++, though even with the knowledge that it would eventually be rewritten, I think it was the right choice for the initial version because of the limited resources we had at the time. It was probably also the right choice for WhatsApp for the same reason.

See Ben Maurer's answer to When did Facebook switch away from using Erlang for Facebook Chat? for more details about why Facebook later switched.

Robin-Wauters,"I would suggest you start writing on your own blog first. In fact, I would urge you to write at least one really awesome post per day to get started.

If you've already done that or can showcase your writing skills exhaustively another way, it's a good idea to build relationships with key people at your target publication (writers and editors).

Pitch them your story idea, or better yet, pitch them the story when you think timing is right, and after you've checked if a similar post hasn't already appeared at the publication or elsewhere.

Contributors generally need to bring something unique to the table: expert thoughts or opinion, an angle about whatever topic that hasn't been talked about (much), data only you have, research only you've made, etc.

Editing is done by writers or editors, it can take a few hours to a few days, depending on the topic's timeliness and whatnot.

Contributors also generally don't get paid, but that's rarely the goal anyway, or else you'd be asking 'how to become a staff writer at a tech blog?'.

Oftentimes, writers will add a company, product, person and whatnot when they write about them, in case there isn't a profile yet. Not always, but most of the time.

The fact that CrunchBase is crowd-sourced also means that there are a LOT of companies and products in CrunchBase that none of the writers have ever written or even heard about. I hope this answers your more specific second question.

Either way, we recommend companies to create and edit profiles themselves as much as possible, to ensure the highest level of accuracy.

Thus, it's not a question of 'sucking at proofreading', but more about speed of execution, which I think sets us apart. We are mindful of getting things right, though, so we read each others' posts and fix typos when we, or our readers for that matter, spot them.

Ari-Shahdadi,"Speaking as an individual and not as (1) a lawyer or (2) someone with any connection to Quora - yes and no.

The language in the TOS regarding ownership is misleading when it comes to content in ""common spaces,"" particularly questions.

First, it's totally unclear whether a question is copyrightable (and thereby ownable) - I'd argue in the vast majority of cases questions are not copyrightable, so the concept of ownership of questions is meaningless.

Second, if you assume questions are copyrightble/ownable, then yes, you ""own"" the original question, but the TOS (and note that it HAS to do this for the site to work) grants Quora a broad license that allows content to be modified, and also sublicensed to users. This means that, while you may ""own"" the original question, Quora can allow users to freely edit it, prevent you from deleting it, etc. This goes for all content in common spaces on the site. When another user edits your content in common spaces, a derivative work is spawned (and so forth as more edits take place), so ownership becomes extremely murky - after 10 edits, who ""owns"" what part of a question (or answer summary, or question details, or...)? This rathole is another reason why I think asserting copyright over most content in common spaces is dubious.

I wouldn't have written the TOS to emphasize ownership for the above reasons, as conceptually it's not a good way to frame how common space content works on the site.

Ari-Shahdadi,"Yannick's answer has several good ones; I'll add the following that I listen to frequently (or did in the past):

Thrice - Their first three albums are amazing; Artist In The Ambulance is a classic of post-hardcore/emo. Their more recent stuff is folky (which coincides with them becoming parents and more religious, FWIW).
Thursday - Grandfathers of post-hardcore, still killing it. Their newest album is very much an evolution of their sound and is a little jarring for longtime fans, but they're amazing; any rock music fan should check out all of their albums.
Poison The Well - Historically more hardcore than ""post"" but these guys pioneered a very grindy/straight-ahead rock sound. Their last album before they broke up, The Tropic Rot, is amazing.
Chiodos - Not as well-known as the others, but Bone Palace Ballet is probably my favorite post-hardcore album ever (string sections!) and their newest album, with a new singer, is also excellent.
Pierce The Veil - Very ""Hot Topic""-ish but their latest album is really quite good, I'm just a bit embarrassed I like it so much.
The Fall Of Troy - They broke up recently, but they were basically a vehicle for Thomas Erak's genius-level guitar tricks. Their live shows were 30-45 minutes of expert guitar masturbation, as a friend of mine put it.
Alesana - They seem to be popular in Latin America; their newest album is a bunch of songs that are good but all sound the same.
Funeral For A Friend - They recently got back together; their older albums are quite good, I haven't heard the new one yet.
Deftones - Deftones are a metal band, but Diamond Eyes is everything a good post-hardcore album should be.
The Bled - They're grindy and somewhat challenging to get into, with weird time changes and odder lyrics, but worth exploring.
Eyes Set To Kill - Their (female) lead singer has an excellent voice, one of the few post-hardcore bands fronted by a woman.
Glassjaw - People may quibble with this, but Glassjaw was a seminal post-hardcore band, and laid the groundwork for a lot of other bands down the road.

Ari-Shahdadi,"A few reasons (you hit on one):

Admins and reviewers are pressed for time and some questions require too much editing to be worth fixing at the moment. Questions that are particularly mangled may require so much work that it's not time-efficient, at that moment, for someone to fix it.
Relatedly, there could be no way at all to fix the question. This is often the case with Survey Questions, and when we don't delete them, we leave them up but tagged so they don't get distributed beyond the people following that topic.
The tags flag for the original asker that he/she should fix the question in a specific manner, hopefully so he/she doesn't make the same mistake. This is a pedagogical function, to point out an error for a user and ask/hope that they fix it and won't make it next time. Note, though, that my own view is that seeing a good example (i.e., someone fixing it) is just as instructive.
The question is ambiguous in a way that only the original asker can resolve or clarify. The Needs to Be Clearer tag is often used in this case.

Ari-Shahdadi,"Neither admins nor reviewers can see anything about who has downvoted an answer. As far as downvotes are concerned, admins and reviewers have as much information as anyone else.
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"""Pending Review"" status applies to users below a certain threshold of...something. As Achilleas said, all users are treated equally, new or old.

All new users have their answers put into the answer review queue (i.e., ""Pending Review"" status) until notifications have been sent on their answers enough times to give the system confidence that they know the basic protocols around using the site.

Users who are out of ""Pending Review"" status can be put back in it if their answers are collapsed enough times. I also suspect that downvotes and question deletions are involved in the determination, but we (the moderators) don't know the algorithm, nor do we know the thresholds involved.

All of this is done automatically by the site on the back-end and moderators have zero transparency as to movements in and out of ""Pending Review"" status, nor do they have any way to ""flip the switch"" on someone in either direction.

Any conspiracy theories about people critical of the site or moderation being put into ""Pending Review"" status are completely false and seem to me to be distractions from why not-new users are put into this status (consistently posting poor content).

There is also no ""whitelist"" of people who can avoid the algorithm; everyone is in the same boat here.

The best way to get out of ""Pending Review"" status is to write good content, and keep writing it, basically.
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"The current review problem has four variables:
The amount of content requiring review, editing or moderation - answers, questions, topic changes, names, etc to be reviewed.
The power of the tools available to a single reviewer - how much a reviewer can process per unit of time given the review tools.
The speed/power of an individual reviewer - how much a reviewer can process per unit of time, period.
The number of reviewers.

One could also imagine a variable (3.5), the amount of time a single review takes, which depends on how much editing a single review action requires - for example, if most of the questions under review require heavy edits, there is a baked in upper limit on how fast reviewing can happen.

(1) and (2) are product issues that the company will address going forward, with product changes to force or incentivize good content and other product changes to give reviewers better tools. To be perfectly clear, I think engineering, product design and automation are where the vast majority of the gains and scaling will come in the review process as Quora gets bigger.

(4) is a problem for the moderation team and the company, to figure out good ways to add reviewers to the pool without sacrificing quality.

(3) is what your question seems to be addressing, which is only a small part of the problem. Because (4) is limited by how good the reviewers are, I'd say the reviewer pool will always be at least ""pretty good"" in terms of raw talent in reviewing, with some outliers on the ""can process stuff like a robot on speed"" end.

The ways to improve (3), given that, are education/training (another thing for the moderation team and company to work on) and experience reviewing, which comes with time. But, note that (3) and (2) are symbiotic in the sense that education, training and experience are also tied to the current tools.

Given that our reviewers are all quite good and we won't recruit reviewers who don't meet that high standard, I don't think we can replace them with better people unless somehow we recruit cyborgs from outside of Quora, build them ourselves, or grow genetically engineered super reviewers in vats, none of which are feasible currently.
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"In terms of ""positive evaluation,"" i.e., checking for good work:

This is a lot more squishy and has to do with how active reviewers are in the community, how well they explain edits, how involved they are in discussing issues, etc. Because all of the admins are fairly active, we develop a decent feel for this, but we definitely need more reliable processes for positive evaluation going forward, which I'll give some thought to (e.g., one can imagine some objective metrics to shoot for, like unreverted edits or edits without complaints).

In terms of ""negative evaluation,"" i.e., auditing for errors:

It's mostly informal right now, although we're working on ways to actively audit admin and reviewer actions in a systematic manner.

Admins can check a log of all special (i.e., not available to all users) actions taken by admins and reviewers for anomalies. We can also review edit logs for reviewers, although this happens infrequently.

The primary way we ""audit"" reviewers is complaints. Issues can be raised with moderation (generally by e-mail to moderation@quora.com) and if anything weird pops up, we look into it. People can also just PM one of the admins if they run into something they are concerned about (I'm happy to field issues privately, for example).

On the whole, I think we've done a good job selecting reviewers, so we've hardly had any problems. To the extent we have had issues, they have been due more to lack of good communication (mostly a breakdown of communication from admins to reviewers) than with anything any individual did ""wrong."" The weak channels of communication is also something that we're also working on improving going forward.

  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"One issue at the moment is that Quora is moderated (questions and answers are reviewed, spelling/grammar on questions is corrected, etc), and there is currently no human infrastructure for setting up non-English moderation teams. The current set of moderation tools are also not internationalized - they're centered around review and editing of English content.

Given Quora's mission of keeping content quality high, which I'm sure applies in all languages, solving the moderation problem is probably one significant issue holding back internationalization.

I'm sure there are other basic technical reasons as well, such as internationalizing all of the components of the site, making UI/UX tweaks appropriate to each international ""market,"" and solving the very significant speed/scaling issues that would come with attracting large groups of users from many different countries.

I can't speak for the company's current prioritization, but it would generally seem to make sense to get the product ""right"" and properly scaled in its original language before solving the significant issues appurtenant to launching internationally.

Ari-Shahdadi,"I think British English is fine.

However, because almost all of the admins and reviewers currently are American, our edits will tend to ""Americanize"" everything that we work on. For example, when using ""e.g."", we will put a comma after, whereas in British English one wouldn't.

Admins and reviewers almost never ""correct"" British English spelling, as far as I've seen, nor is it suggested that they do.

Ari-Shahdadi,"You may want to see the following, Food Tech Startups: Why have no ""Etsy for food"" startups taken off?, which mentions http://www.foodzie.com as an ""Etsy for food.""
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"Probably a few reasons:

Piracy - Fully digital copies are easier to pirate, I imagine, if only because you've now packaged the game up nicely for digital distribution once the encryption is cracked. I otherwise see no reason why you couldn't use the same security scheme as physical copies and have it work just as well.
Size - PS3 games are absolutely massive sometimes, e.g., FFXIII is two Blu-Ray discs worth of stuff. The demand for downloading games that big over comparatively thin pipes just isn't there. You also have a lot of PS3s out there with small hard drives that can't store a lot of all-digital games (early versions were 40GB-60GB, newer ones are 120GB, and games are often 4GB+ - most users aren't handy enough to swap their smaller drives out for a cheap 500GB drive).
Profit - Console gamers are less sophisticated than PC gamers still prefer to have physical fulfillment for ""real""/""big"" games; Sony's failed experiment with the PSP Go proves this out. Assuming that all-digital console game sales would work like Steam has worked for Valve is folly, as consoles tend to lag PCs in terms of adoption of new technologies and distribution mechanisms. Ergo, digital sales of major titles would probably suck and not be worth the hassle for the vast majority of games except pre-ordained blockbusters.
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"Kristen's observations about price are spot on.

After a few Four Loko experiences, here are some observations about effect:
The alcohol to volume-of-liquid ratio is very good; one full can of Four Loko is equal to about five beers.
The calorie-to-beer-equivalent ratio is also quite good; one full can of Four Loko is about 660 calories. For comparison, most light beers are about 100 calories, so on a per-drink basis, you're coming out ahead, roughly.
The amount of caffeine is quite high; one full can of Four Loko is equal to about 2.5 cups of coffee when you factor in the effects of the supplements in it (taurine, etc).
The taste is generally OK, although some flavors (anything lemonade) are ghastly.
The feeling you get is unique, to say the least. Once it kicks in, you feel both intoxicated and energized - unlike Red Bull, this stuff really does give you wings. Basically, the world becomes a little more awesome while you're riding the Four Loko wave.
You also get drunk faster; two cans and most people are good to go. This is actually the main reason why inexperienced drinkers are ill-advised to drink it - they can easily consume way more than they can handle in a short period of time, and the caffeine/alcohol combo can be deadly in that concentration.
Assuming they consume limited quantities, anecdotally it seems Four Loko allows some people to avoid a bad hangover. My friends think this is because of the supplements included.

The main negative of Four Loko is that some people crash ridiculously hard within a few hours of having it. I think this is because you're combining three crashes (alcohol, caffeine, refined sugar) into one, which just destroys you once they all hit.

It's a shame they're banning the stuff, it's an interesting drinking experience, like a jacked up version of Sparks, if anyone recalls that.

*I found these stats on a website somewhere and promptly forgot the source, as the company doesn't release the data. If anyone wants to suggest edits with sourcing, please feel free.
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"Expanding on Mircea's answer a little bit, attractiveness is subjective, so the only way you can know is by gauging how lots of different people react to your appearance in different contexts. This could be anything from counting how many people hit on you, and how often, to what they say to you about how you look, to what they say to others about how you look. If a broad spectrum of people in different situations seem to think you're physically attractive and treat you as such, you probably are; as for how attractive, you can judge the magnitude of each reaction to your appearance. Crudely, I suppose, you could also take Jane's advice and see how much you get away with because of your looks, which is probably a fairly good indicator of attractiveness all things considered.

Trying to figure this out entirely on your own and in isolation is a recipe for trouble, if only because most people have a skewed self-image in one direction or another, which will color their internal mental model of their attractiveness.

The main negative of relying on external indicia to judge your own attractiveness is that those indicia will be skewed by the context. For example, to overgeneralize, in my experience others will tend to find you more attractive when you're an outgoing, positive person, and less when you're not. The best way to solve for the context variable is to get feedback in a variety of contexts, including both in-person and, e.g., on photo, keeping in mind that some people just look better in person or in photos and visa-versa.

Ari-Shahdadi,"I'm not sure if this is the most, but TikTok finished at $941,718: http://www.kickstarter.com/proje...

It seems like the projects that do well have some of the following characteristics:
Built-in viral distribution for the Kickstarter link (e.g., there was a book made by Tumblr people, and the project got a ton of distribution on Tumblr because of that).
They kick back something really cool to the people who fund the project (e.g., a TikTok kit).
They are advancing some kind of cause (e.g., Diaspora).
They are advancing a popular cultural agenda among Kickstarter users (e.g., a movie about punk bands).
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"Because it's easier and more comforting to think in line with a social group than it is to form independent opinions on a wide variety of issues, opinions that may alienate an individual from his/her social group.

I think this phenomenon is basically another example of groupthink - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro... :

Individual creativity, uniqueness, and independent thinking are lost in the pursuit of group cohesiveness, as are the advantages of reasonable balance in choice and thought that might normally be obtained by making decisions as a group. During groupthink, members of the group avoid promoting viewpoints outside the comfort zone of consensus thinking. A variety of motives for this may exist such as a desire to avoid being seen as foolish, or a desire to avoid embarrassing or angering other members of the group. Groupthink may cause groups to make hasty, irrational decisions, where individual doubts are set aside, for fear of upsetting the group?s balance. The term is frequently used pejoratively, in hindsight. Additionally, it is difficult to assess the quality of decision making in terms of outcomes all the time, but one can almost always evaluate the quality of the decision-making process.

There is also the higher cognitive load of keeping up with and forming distinct opinions on lots of different issues; it's just easier to sign up to one party line that you mostly agree with. Cognitive dissonance will tend to take care of the rest when it comes to issues on which one disagrees with the party.

Edit: Another thing to point out is that many people who vote are single-issue, or maybe handful-of-issue voters, who focus on a small subset of issues to the exclusion of all/most others. These kinds of voters stick with the party to advance a particular agenda, sometimes to their own detriment - if you assume (maybe incorrectly), for example, that Democratic economic policy is good for the poor, there are many poor people who vote Republican because of the perception that Republican social policies are more in-line with their religious beliefs. In this sense, people are partisan because partisanship accomplishes a small set of policy goals that they feel are important enough to sacrifice all or most others.
  "
Ari-Shahdadi,"I think so, yes.

At minimum, mechanically, counsel sits in to make sure that minutes are kept and that all board actions are properly recorded and signed-off on (like granting stock options, which the board has to approve of). This corporate ""sanitation"" function becomes important during diligence, which happens during a financing or major transaction, because proper recordation of board action is important for things like establishing the true capitalization of the company.

I suppose one could have a non-lawyer perform this function, but that seems dangerous.

Note also that many law firms will send associates or partners to board meetings for free (i.e., no bill) because of how important it is to have a good lawyer around.

Counsel is also sometimes/often a trusted advisor to the company, and so the Board will want counsel there to keep track of what is going on and give legal and business advice when necessary.

I've heard of companies that exclude company counsel from board meetings from time to time, but I think it's uncommon to do so.

Ari-Shahdadi,"We've discussed this among the admins after some complaints from users about cold PMs, and here's my two cents:

I'm a little torn on the issue. I think cold calling generally is OK - it's a way for people to introduce themselves to people they don't know and make connections they otherwise would not have made. It's particularly OK for me if it's not just automated or templated messages, but rather personal messages to individuals seeking to connect on subjects/ventures of particular interest. I also see how some users wouldn't like to be solicited through personal messages, and would find this offensive or inappropriate.

I'd generally say that personalized ""cold calls,"" as long as they aren't broad-based and too numerous (I'm intentionally being vague, as it's a contextual determination), should be OK on Quora.

They shouldn't be OK if:
They are ""spam,"" i.e., identical/repetitive/templated messages sent to multiple users.
If they are too frequent or too numerous.
If they are harassing or otherwise inappropriate.

I'm on the fence as to solicitation, but I think it should be tolerated to some extent in this context; it may be that people want to be solicited for some things.

This is, to some extent, a case-by-case assessment, but it's not a behavior that I would want to see banned outright, as the current system is a good way to make connections between users who don't per se know each other.

Also, different firms have different policies on whether GPs can invest in startups in which their firm is not investing (sometimes called ""cherry-picking"").

In our case, we chose to implement a blanket policy that our GPs are not allowed to make direct personal private technology investments, whether side by side with our firm or otherwise.

As a founder all you should care about is recruiting talent and raising money. Living in Denver or Boulder doesn't preclude you from Colorado money, and SF/NY money will look at you the same.

Talent depends on your industry, etc. clearly Denver has more people and therefore is probably easier to hire than in Boulder. But if you really want to grow you better be recruiting from outside Colorado.

The truth is that a very few members of a startup are actually entrepreneurs, most just want a job that is ""cooler"" and perhaps provides more flexibility.

As an entrepreneur, I don't know what else I would do. I have no idea what job to apply to in a ""real"" company. I work in Startups because I have no other option. And that's the best thing -- being unable to discern between what I can do and what I should.

For employees of a startup, the answer is a bit cleaner: because tech Startups are harder (lower salary, worst benefits) they provide more soft benefits - beer fridges, etc.

But what is best for the folks working at a startup is the ability to effect future success and own a piece of that success (both personally and financially). Many startup employees are able to feel fulfilled and empowered, and in this world where we feel minimized, that's pretty darn nice.

Set up periodic meetings, keep them in the loop, ask for specific things (not just intros), make them feel like part of your success.

Become friends.  People want their friends to succeed. Get to know your mentor. Find out if you can help them. Understand their goals.

Don't suck. The worst founders to mentor are the ones that don't treat the engagement as a relationship and give it consistency and are unreliable. The company can fail (at least three companies I have worked with decided to close shop by the end of the program) but the relationship shouldn't.

Micah-Baldwin,"There are really two questions to answer when looking at a standing desk:

1) motorized vs. not -- you will not stand for 8 hours at a clip, especially in the beginning, so unless you have a place to sit and work, an adjustable height desk is pretty important. Motorized are going to take you out of the cheap range fast.

2) size: a standing desk should be free of everything other than what you need to work. There is no need to get a huge one. In addition, you should get a gel pad to stand on ($15 - $100) to reduce fatigue.

Personally, the cheapest way is to stack cinder blocks on a current desk, but the best standing desk will run you $500-$700 (before shipping).

(On a side note, I got a treadmill desk, which serves as a standing desk when I'm not walking. Not cheap, but awesome.)

Phil is your best bet to get Gary's interest. If Phil will champion your company, then you have an internal advocate. If Phil doesn't like your idea, you are probably not a good fit.

Beyond that, getting an introduction from a trusted resource is helpful.

But most importantly, Gary is a businessman's businessman. If your business has no apparent or near term business model he will have minimal interest (as will most investors). He worked hard to get the money he has, and if he is going to invest it, he is going to make it work for him.

Finally, he is a slow investor, rarely first money in, and a small investor. So unless you think there is material value he can bring to the table, the effort to hunt him down and convince him and his team to spend time/invest, may not be as valuable as you might think.

On a personal level, Gary and most of the folks at VaynerMedia - AJ, Phil, Sam, Matt, etc are awesome and are worth the time to get to know - regardless of their investment potential.

Micah-Baldwin,"If you are speaking about the expectation of return by angels specifically, then its a difficult question to ask. There are basically 4 types of angels:

Friends and Family: pure emotional investment, dont expect returns, but excited if they happen (if they have a different outlook, would suggest not taking their money)
Emotional Angels: Invest because they like the act of investing in startups. Expect to fail more often than succeed, or get a huge return on most investments.
Professional Angels: No different than professional investors. They have a plan and a thesis, and invest based on that. Expect some amount of return, but understand that they will always own a small portion of the company, and therefore will never see a huge return ala a VC.
Super Angel / Micro-VC: They expect real returns because they are probably investing other people's money. Usually have a ""fund"" with LPs. Treat their investments like VCs, expect to gain benefit from being in a deal very early (discounts, warrants, cheaper equity, etc.), and potentially will follow on an initial investment with additional capital, unlike other angel classes.

Who should you pursue? It depends on your capital requirements and stage of the business. Usually, the path is Friends and Family then Angels then VC. The glut of seed money has many people skipping the F/F and Angel round, but that doesnt mean that EVERYONE can do that.

Your project sounds big and like every business Ive ever been pitched ""revolutionary and disruptive."" I always give the same advice - dont raise money until you need to. Raising money is like putting gas on a fire. If you dont have a fire (or the wrong fire) then the gas is wasted.

When you decide that raising money is important for you, then determine your capital requirements (do you need to raise $250k or $5mm, for example), which will help you determine who your potential audience (angel vs. VC) is. Be able to articulate three things:

The problem you are solving;
The solution you are developing;
How that solution will make lots of money;

In terms of #3, its not about getting to $15mm in year three, but if there is actually a real business in a real market that can get real big (real fast). If it turns out that what you are building is important, but wont be gigantic (potential of $1B in value -- not revenue), then you will find raising from VCs to be more difficult.

At the end of the day, it really comes down to trust and relationships. The more time is spent with the entrepreneur / VC, the more likely good deals get done.

For the entrepreneur, its imperative to not just chase the money, but focus on whats important (usually control). Those times can be really exciting, but if not handled properly, will end up with bitter people on both sides of the deal.

  "
Micah-Baldwin,"aving now done all three, here are my thoughts:

As a first-time entrepreneur, you have zero credibility. While your idea might be amazing, the truth is that you are an unknown. You have never started anything successfully, and --more importantly-- never finished anything successfully either. You have made no investors money directly, and therefore your ability to raise real money from real investors is going to be real hard.

Your company begins to get some steam, you have a killer set of advisors, and people convince you that you should raise money and go big. So you put together a list of of people you want to get to invest. As put put together that list, you realize a few things: 1) it includes only people you have heard about on techcrunch; 2) you dont know anyone on this list; and 3) have no idea how to reach any of these people on the list.

If thats the case, then an accelerator is a good move. Where else can you have some of the top investors and entrepreneurs see how you think about a problem and how quickly you can progress in a pressure filled situation? Instant credibility, and your investors will be folks that want to work with you and see you succeed.

If you decide to skip the accelerator and go after a seed round (usually ~$500k, maybe as much a million), you are pretty much pricing yourself below large VCs. Are super angels better than normal angels? Not really, except they probably have stronger and broader rolodexes but also have a much larger deal flow meaning you will get less attention. Dave McClure is the perfect example. Get some time with Dave and you will get some great direction. But getting time? Well, thats fucking hard. Angels and super angels will tend to not get involved in your business, so for some that could be a benefit -- or a detriment.

Big VC is great for a couple of reasons: 1) they have a lot of money, so if you need more time to figure out what the company should be, they will have cash for you; 2) they tend to co-invest more often with more people, so the ability to build a syndicate increases; and 3) they have strong corporate ties that can accelerate business development. On the other hand, if you arent cool; you arent getting attention. Its pretty straight forward. You need to have the ability to properly engage with a partner that might be on a dozen boards and only thinks about your company once per 4-6 weeks. Communication is paramount, and if you are unsure of how or what to communicate, you can find having a big VC investor tough. In addition, your expectations for a large liquidity event just shot through the roof. Big VCs do big exits. If you arent sure you can exit big, then you will never be able to get a big VC interested in the first place.

At the end of the day, the decision of the entrepreneur is often driven by his/her stage in his/her career, and the type of business s/he is building. Dont let your ego determine your path to investment; let your business tell you.

Micah-Baldwin,"Its funny that you asked this, given that I was just chatting with Jennifer Cabala about this very thing. The first company Vosnap (which was a very early group texting type application in 2008) was sold to a local Colorado company about 6-8 months after the first startup weekend. The first real success was Paul Stamatiou's Skribit, which got a bit of funding and ran for quite awhile. Other startups that got their start at a StartupWeekend include Zaarly and LaunchRock.

Several others (I think) used StartupWeekend to vett the ideas, including Indinero's Jessica Mah and Foodspotting's Alexa Andrzejewski who had the concepts up and running, but wanted to see if others believed as they did.

I think some of these are still kicking: http://startupweekend.org/about/...

The interesting thing about StartupWeekend is that if you get deep in the development of a company by the end of the weekend, you believe it has the ability to be something HUGE...then most people go back to their day jobs, and development slips and the normal fear of ""can I do it"" seeps in, and the project dies. I would love to see at the end of the weekend a group of people just walk into their jobs on Monday, quit and go for it.

Please, keep that in mind when reading my answer... :)

I would say that Burning Man is weeklong gathering in the desert where a bunch of people consciously go about ""burning"" (or getting rid of) the default set of assumptions about how the world has to be, as told to us by the (mostly western) MAN -- capitalistic, competitive, scarcity-based, hierarchical, judgmental, dogmatic, etc. -- and seeing what happens.

So, it's a week-long gathering of people who are interested in exploring a world which is about individuals producing instead of masses consuming; of people creating something of direct value to their community rather than doing whatever it takes to be able to buy stuff off a shelf that has little intrinsic value, but comes with a silly brand or logo on it.

It is a week of turning your fantasies and your imagination into reality rather than passively consuming a manufactured image that predictable advertisements try to brainwash you into believing is the only reality possible.

Burning Man is a place where accepting your and others' uniqueness, freedom of expression and right to do whatever you want (as long as it doesn't violate anyone elses rights) is highly valued.  So, in a fundamental way, it's a place that inspires people to participate instead of to spectate, to suspend fixed judgement about what is right and wrong, and to instead become immersed in the field of infinite possibilities.

The weird bits (sex, drugs, rock and roll, outrageous outfits, camps, art work, etc.) all derive from a combination of the above which results in a celebration of our collective individuality and uniqueness, instead of adhering to a socially coerced, manufactured, branded, homogenous set of norms that one institution or another (companies, governments, religions) are forcing down people's gullets in order to control them and keep them in line.

hmm... As I read the above, I see that it doesn't really do a good job of answering the question in layman's terms...  but, I guess, Burning Man is not for the laymen anyway...

It's a place for the playmen of the the highest order -- the crazy ones who believe in their god-like power to shape a reality where the purpose of life is to give and experience as much joy and freedom as possible!

That said, I will never again locate my start-up west of the 405! No chance, no way, no how!  So Culver City 100% over Santa Monica.

Because I'll tell you something: the biggest fraud sprung upon the rookie entrepreneur in L.A. is this stupidity known as ""Silicon Beach."" 

Calling ""west of the 405"" ""Silicon Beach"",  is akin to the naming the Department of War, The Department of Defense. Sure it makes sound like a good idea, but it doesn't make it a good idea.

You see, every Angeleno knows that the lamest thing about Los Angeles is not the vacuous stares of the fit-and-brainless folks in the ""industry,"" it's the god-awful traffic.  That makes the center of evil in L.A. the 405 freeway.  So all your moves need to consider this evil vein running through the city.

With that in mind, I feel that putting your startup west of the 405 is what the devil would do if he had control of your destiny, because that assures misery for the 80%+ of your people who invariably live east of the 405.  No amount of hypothetical biking on the beach or rubbing elbows with fellow nerds stuck in the same predicament will make up for that soul-draining commute every morning.

This is because, as humans, we are limited by our minds, wherein certain concepts are just too big to fit.  The only way to deal with those is to abstract them.  And each language does this in its own way...

Farhad-Mohit,"Ever since I received my MBA from Wharton, and especially after successful exits of BizRate.com (my MBA class project) and Shopzilla, this question is a common one that I get.

So I wrote the answer on my personal blog a while ago, but since nobody  reads that, I thought I'd post it on Quora too. :)

OK, let's start with what I think you need to start a good business... (focusing on internet businesses, given our audience here...)

What it takes to make a great (internet) business:

1) A good idea
Large market
Needed / Necessary Product / Service
Viral Marketing
Increasing returns to scale (defensible position)
First-mover (nice to have)
Intellectual Property (nice to have)

2) A great team
Domain specific knowledge (MBA could help here especially if you to raise money or speak the language of finance)
Complementary skills that cover all bases (strategy, product development, technology, operations, marketing, business dev / sales, finance)

3) The guts / backing to jump and take the risk
Enough cash to get started / survive for a while
Connections to sources of capital
Back-up plan in case of failure

4) The passion / perseverance to commit 10 years of your life (time, energy and money) to the cause
Flat part of exponential curve could take years? zero-to-one is hard.
We only notice businesses when they hit exponential growth and therefore underestimate time / effort.
Examples: Twitter was Odeo, Groupon was ThePoint, BizRate.com was Binary Compass Enterprises.

That said, if you have all of the above then an MBA is not necessary.

If missing some, then here is what I found an MBA can provide:
1) Two years to find your teammates
Lots of people in business school are open to talking about starting a business (also don?t forget about hitting up the Engineering department for complementary talent!)
School curriculum leads to working in teams on business cases where you can see who has complementary skills you need
Business school is not rocket science, so it leaves you time to pursue other interests.
Top Schools (Ivy League) Advantage: Powerful people send their kids there.. top connections to sources of capital

2) Two years to work on refining ideas and picking a good one
Can take classes specifically related to your business (marketing plan, business plan, legal aspects, etc.)
Teammates will work on your project for free, as part of course work in above classes: BizRate.com was my entrepreneurship class project.

3) An MBA from a top school can give you courage / open doors
Good credential that is generally respected by investors / vcs on your resume
Top schools have great alumni networks and work on the ?old boys? networking model of helping their classmates
In case of failure you have the fall-back of a high income job (albeit at a lame large institution)

4) An MBA can help you learn the lingo of business
In some cases this will help you when talking to investors or trying to raise money
You will learn to say things like ? we will achieve increasing returns to scale upon reaching critical mass? instead of ?once we get going, things?ll be really fucking great!?

Other points:

In general I would not consider an MBA from anything but the top school.  The connections / credentials are just not there at some rinky dink MBA.  (Think of the adage: ?In business it?s not what you know, but who you know.? which, like it or not, applies.)

I really did not find much of the information (other than lingo / some legal aspects of setting up a corp / financial analysis stuff) that was offered in my MBA curriculum that was particularly helpful to actually starting / running a business.  Most of the curriculum (at least when I was in school, 1994 ? 1996) was geared to getting you ready for a life as a cog in some big business or fortune 100 (bank, consulting firm, fortune 100).

Farhad-Mohit,"If this was 2001 I'd say DotSpots failed, but since we're in 2011, I'll say that DotSpots has pivoted....  It is now: Gri.pe.

If you want the story of why DotSpots fai... err, pivoted... Well, that's something to talk about:

Essentially with the founding of DotSpots, I made some pretty big strategic mistakes, that in hindsight, a bit of humility would have helped me avoid.

You see, in 2007 when we founded DotSpots, I was coming off the success of the >$500MM sale of BizRate.com / Shopzilla, and was feeling, let's say a tad bit over-confident...

So here's what I did:
1) I picked a market that I knew nothing about (newspaper publishing)
2) This market happened to be imploding... with everyone acting as if there house was on fire... but no mind... I had created two top 100 web properties, so we didn't need to worry about such trivialities.
3) The product we wanted to create (semantically matching distributed objects of thought to groups of newspaper articles) had a huge technical risk... Ah, but that just made it more fun for us to come to work everyday.
4) The idea was impossible to explain to anyone in under 10 minutes and without getting somewhat puzzled looks... well, that's because we're so smart and everyone else is stupid... right? (not quite)
5) No business model?  No problem... who needs one of those?  It's not like we're going to ask for outsider money (or advice).
6) And let's do it all as a fully distributed team spread all over the world working out of our homes... That should raise the degree of difficulty to a level that is worthy of a follow-up to my past success.

Surprisingly, we did manage to overcome the technical hurdle and deliver a pretty slick product, totally due to the fact that our technical team was so great.  However, on every other front we felt the pain, and there was really nothing we could do about points 1 and 2... an imploding market you know nothing about is not a good place to start a business folks... :)

So, unsurprisingly, after a while it became very clear that we would either need to pivot or get off the pot:

Fortunately we pivoted and with Gri.pe we feel that we're actually onto something pretty cool:
1) Customer satisfaction is a market I know a thing or two about (hrrm BizRate).
2) Gri.pe is a mobile, social, location-based, real-time, app in the local commerce, online to offline space.  Umm... slightly hotter market than newspaper publishing.
3) The product is dead simple technically...  in fact, the challenge now is to keep our bad ass devs happy (hopefully scaling issues will be the technical challenge keep us busy going forward. :)
4) Simplest idea ever: Gripe app let's you get complaints heard and resolved with the help of your friends and followers.
5) Business Model? We are the world's first Public Resolution company... turning negative word-of-mouth into priceless positive word-of-mouth, and bringing online customers to real world shops.  There's gold in them there hills!
6) After 3 years of operating as a distributed team, we're up the learning curve a bit and have minimized the costs of this and maximized the benefits... So all good there.

Well... there you have it and here we are.

Stay tuned to gri.pe to see what happens next.

Farhad-Mohit,"Several ways:

1) Gri.pe is a location aware mobile app (with a website), GetSat is primarily a website.
2) Our focus is totally different:  Gripe is used for filing complaints or praise about local businesses and national franchises, GetSat is a primarily focused on being a website feedback platform.
3) We strive for on complaint resolution, not broad feedback.  So, we have specific features / questions geared towards that (like: How can the merchant resolve your gripe?).  GetSat is broader in scope and allows people to give ideas, ask questions, etc. again focused mostly on websites features / bugs.
4) We reach out to merchants (whether they're working with us or not) on behalf of the customer...  To my knowledge Get Sat does not have such a feature.
5) We allow the user to link their twitter and FB accounts (more soon) and distribute the gripe or cheer as far and wide as possible.  GetSat is mostly focused on displaying the data on their own site.
6) As a mobile platform we allow users to submit photos along with their gripes (soon videos too).  Get Sat is only textual feedback.

There are more differences, but that's a good start... :)

Farhad-Mohit,"They are all basically price shopping engines, but each came at this thing from a slightly different angle and therefore even though they ended up at the same place similar products today, their past might be interesting to anyone interested in the topic...

To that end, I'll give all you Quora viewers a brief history of these three companies from my (obviously biased) point of view:

Shopzilla (which I know most about) started off as BizRate.com (1996) with a focus on merchant ratings (BizRate at some point became the largest feedback network in the world, surveying millions of customers / month).  So, as a service we were traditionally focused on telling you not just prices but which merchants were the best in terms of service.

We also decided very early to go wide with our product selection into soft categories (like flowers, jewelry, shoes, clothing, etc.)  And, also to hit SEM  (Search engine marketing) early and very proactively, building one of the most sophisticated automated bidding systems for SEM that there was.

In fact, we became so strong in SEM that we kinda gave up on developing customer loyalty for our product and just focused on landing page optimization and SEM buys.  As a result our core service (shopping search) kinda stopped evolving and improving.

As others followed our lead, and we all copied each others ""successful ideas"", we all basically devolved into the same service, give or take.

Shopping.com started out as two different companies, Dealtime (1998) and Epinions (1999)... Both were very well capitalized by blue chip investors.  They ran hardest (read: burnt most cash - some $160MM+ and that was before their IPO!) and Dealtime was the biggest shopping search engine for a while, with Epinions, a late entrant in 1999, having the coolest product review product and most hype.  Epinions also were the masters of SEO and built some of the coolest tech in the space, imho.

By 2003, as BizRate.com / Shopzilla was growing quickly on the back on its SEM efforts and was poised to take over the #1 slot in terms of traffic, Dealtime and Epinions merged to create Shopping.com an entity that was big enough to go public (which they did).  Dealtime never was really great at doing anything in particular but hyping itself and raising money.  Epinions was truly an innovator in the product review space, but they launched at the exact wrong time with a soon fueding management team (different story that others can tell :), and into the dot com burst of 2000.

Cool as their tech was, Epinions didn't really have a shot.

Together, as Shopping.com, they had a great name and powerful backers, but not much more...  They still did very well in SEO due to Epinions' content, and in SEM Dealtime was just slightly above average... So, they kinda lumbered along until their blue chip investors pawned them off to eBay... who I'm sure is thrilled with their purchase today. :)

PriceGrabber was founded by some scrappy guys on a shoestring budget and just a little over $1MM in angel funding, sometime in 1999. They focused on the best monetizing categories (Computer Hardware and Digital Cameras).  They hand-manicured their listings into nice product catalogs and truly took care of their customers.  For traffic they partnered with specialist sites (like DPreview.com) who gave them qualified leads, but required a lot of hand-holding.

I would say out of the three of us, while Pricegrabber was definitely the smallest, they did build the most customer loyalty.

The problem for them was that they really didn't have any sophisticated technology.  Their systems were all semi-manual and they simply could not scale their offering / user experience into harder to categorize / catalog soft categories (It's hard to list all the vendors for the exact same bouquet of roses, since roses don't come with a barcode / sku).

As a result, they didn't grow as fast in those areas, or overall.

Still, because of their customer loyalty, they built a nice little business over time.

That said, to put a cap on this post, it's interesting that all these companies were bought by public companies within about a year of each other (Shopzilla by Scripps, Shopping.com by eBay, and PriceGrabber by Experian).

And, since then, innovation by all three has basically ground to a halt.

Farhad-Mohit,"The simplest way I can explain the uncertainty principle it is that if you know exactly where something is (and I mean EXACTLY) then in effect it has to be still there for that moment... Therefore, you can't know how fast it's moving or in which direction (at that moment).

Conversely, if you know exactly how fast something is moving in space over time, then you can't be sure where it is at any moment, because whatever duration of space and time you pick (however tiny) to measure over, you still have to deal with an infinite number locations / moments that the object has to travel through.

Of course, I'm just a layman myself, so I say, instead of worrying to much about the uncertainty principle, joyfully embrace the certainty of being...

Farhad-Mohit,"Originally the question was: Explain Burning Man in layman's terms.
Please, keep that in mind when reading my answer... :)

I would say that Burning Man is weeklong gathering in the desert where a bunch of people consciously go about ""burning"" (or getting rid of) the default set of assumptions about how the world has to be, as told to us by the (mostly western) MAN -- capitalistic, competitive, scarcity-based, hierarchical, judgmental, dogmatic, etc. -- and seeing what happens.

So, it's a week-long gathering of people who are interested in exploring a world which is about individuals producing instead of masses consuming; of people creating something of direct value to their community rather than doing whatever it takes to be able to buy stuff off a shelf that has little intrinsic value, but comes with a silly brand or logo on it.

It is a week of turning your fantasies and your imagination into reality rather than passively consuming a manufactured image that predictable advertisements try to brainwash you into believing is the only reality possible.

Burning Man is a place where accepting your and others' uniqueness, freedom of expression and right to do whatever you want (as long as it doesn't violate anyone elses rights) is highly valued.  So, in a fundamental way, it's a place that inspires people to participate instead of to spectate, to suspend fixed judgement about what is right and wrong, and to instead become immersed in the field of infinite possibilities.

The weird bits (sex, drugs, rock and roll, outrageous outfits, camps, art work, etc.) all derive from a combination of the above which results in a celebration of our collective individuality and uniqueness, instead of adhering to a socially coerced, manufactured, branded, homogenous set of norms that one institution or another (companies, governments, religions) are forcing down people's gullets in order to control them and keep them in line.

hmm... As I read the above, I see that it doesn't really do a good job of answering the question in layman's terms...  but, I guess, Burning Man is not for the laymen anyway...

It's a place for the playmen of the the highest order -- the crazy ones who believe in their god-like power to shape a reality where the purpose of life is to give and experience as much joy and freedom as possible!

Professor Thom's on 2nd Ave is great unless a Boston sports team has a game that night.  The likes of Mayahuel and Cienfuegos are nice, but keep in mind that the drinks are expensive and the scene gets very packed and loud during peak hours.

I'm a fan of The Immigrant on 9th between 1st and 2nd, which is a little on the ""dark and cozy"" side (e.g. can be a bit of a date bar) but is very unpretentious and is a great spot for a drink.  For something a little more unpretentious, there's Tile Bar on the northwest corner of 1st and 7th -- PBRs and a jukebox without the moderate-to-questionable sketchiness of some of the East Village's popular dives.

Caroline-McCarthy,"You know, I've looked into this extensively out of curiosity about the same question, and actually did a presentation for Ignite NYC about it last summer (
-- keep in mind that Ignite uses a pecha-kucha inspired format so it's a little jumpy as the slides keep rolling automatically).  My answer to this question is more or less from the perspective of the Gen-Y business traveler, so keep that in mind.

I believe it's been reasonably proven through survey results that Gen-Y wants to have more workplace flexibility or at least the ability to work from home.  That could easily be construed into wanting a more flexible, nomadic life.  But you also have to keep in mind the fact that the Internet actually allows us to do LESS travel -- the buzzwords here are telepresence, videoconferencing, virtual offices, etc.  Many of the same technologies that permit us to be ""anywhere"" do so because they reduce the need for face-to-face interaction.  Consequently, while we may have the ability to travel somewhere and work in the process, we also have the ability to do cheap, frequent, high-quality video calls with the people we'd be visiting in that ""somewhere.""

I think the central tension here is between having the (informational) world at your fingertips through digital technology in a way that requires less interaction with the physical world (e.g. Google it rather than biking to the library, order it online rather than going to the store), and yet being freer to roam the physical world thanks to the flexibilities that digital technology affords.

There are also some impracticalities, which I learned through a year of traveling:
Short-term sublets are much costlier per night than longer-term ones. I found this through very deep analysis (read: I was looking for somewhere to live) of Craigslist, Airbnb, etc.  I know some people who have solved this by traveling in groups or by apartment-swapping, but that is a MASSIVE logistical headache.
The IRS and the fine folks who handle your jury duty summonses do not take kindly to, ""But I'm in California for three more months and then I don't really know where I'm going.""  Trust me on this one.
There are things you don't think about immediately with regard to not having a permanent or semi-permanent residence.  I ended up spending enormously higher amounts of money on food because I didn't have a fully-stocked kitchen and pantry (spices, olive oil, rice, etc.) that would otherwise permit me to cook more frequently.

And then, lest we forget, many (most?) members of the Net Generation don't have this digital privilege anyway, even some of those who are earning very enviable salaries.  I think about what my high school and college classmates are doing, on average -- teachers, engineers, doctors, lawyers, theater professionals, the occasional coffee-shop dreamer -- and face-to-face interaction is still so crucial for those professions that ""the peripatetic life"" just isn't possible.

Chris-Messina,"I created the first hashtag on August 23, 2007 and explained the process and rationale in this blog post:

http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/...

Essentially there was a widespread desire in the early Twitter community to provide some means for groups to organize themselves. Many looked to the model of Flickr and other standard web-based group systems as inspiration. It occurred to me, however, that a significant amount of Twitter usage occurred over SMS or other low-bandwidth channels, making group management tedious, if not impossible. Discovery of groups while on the go was another problem.

Thus, the simplest solution was to embed the group token in the tweet itself and use functionality like 'track' to follow the topic (Twitter removed the track feature long ago, but trending topics injected new life and relevance into hashtags).

Thus any user could create a new group simply by tweeting with a word ? however, there needed to be a way to separate the ""meta from the meat"". I chose the hash symbol because it was a convention already established in IRC channels and on Jaiku. Any user could then ""join"" a group conversation simply by appending a given hashtag to their tweets.

If spammers ended up taking over a hashtag due to popularity, the ease with which hashtags are created enabled non-spammers to abandon the hashtag and move on quickly. Indeed, the very ephemerality of hashtags is what makes them easy and compelling to use in a fast-moving communication medium like Twitter.

FWIW, I never imagined that hashtags would catch on as they did ? especially since Ev specifically told me that Twitter would instead use machine learning to group tweets and that hashtags were too ""nerdy"" to ever go mainstream.

Jason-Keath,"Killing another person should be done when there are a lack of all other options to prevent the death of others. War falls into this column (sometimes). Self defense as well.

The Death Penalty is a Punihsment
The death penalty is enforced not to defend life, not to prevent future crime, and not for the betterment of society as a whole (as many have quoted it's failure as a deterrent), but rather, it is used to satisfy the personal (and very internal) desire of individuals to punish another individual for their pain, sorry, guilt, sadness, and outrage.

If the death penalty was used to protect society as a whole, it would potentially hold more merit. The government exist to protect it's citizens. But instead it serves only those individuals who wish revenge, retribution, and emotional ""closure"" to a wound caused by the worst criminals in our system.

The Death Penalty Devalues Life
Our view of whether the death penalty is a positive benefit to society actually comes down to how much we value other people in our society, it correlates strongly with how much we value the life of those we do not know, in fact the life of people we may not even appreciate, value, acknowledge.

Liberals have a stronger believe that we should support each other, be each other's keeper. That we should rehabilitate criminals more to than penalize them. Over very penal system is named so because it focuses on punishment and separation from society than it does on improving the moral character of criminals and improving their ability to contribute to society.

Consider where most executions in the US take place. 13 southern states have conducted 73% of all executions since the ban was lifted in 1976.


(US executions since 1976, source: Death penalty in the US mapped)

These are of course the same states it where it was at one time ""normal"" for slaves to be executed. Many of these states such as North Carolina and Virginia had so called Black Codes (United States) which were basically stronger death penalty laws for blacks compared to white. At one point in Virginia there were 5 crimes that a white man could be executed for and 70 that a black man could be sentenced to the death penalty for. Clearly slavery taught much of the south to value blacks less than their own race.

(Caveat, half of southern executions come from Texas. Many of the causes of a high number of executions are magnified in Texas where elected judges have to be hard on crime, the legal system in general is less ""fair"" to violent offenders, and the population is very high)

I would argue that slavery's devaluing of life has continued til today. Our morals and ethics and outlooks on like come get passed along through nurturing, for better or worse.

When You Devalue Life, You Devalue Society As A Whole
If you truly view life as precious, as the most precious thing we have and will ever have, creating scenarios or reasons for why another person's life should be taken away becomes a very short list. But if you value certain people's lives less than others, you can more easily believe that the death penalty is a useful penalty. We all do this to some extent. Many would for instance sacrifice the life of someone they don't know for someone they love, forced to choose. But a mindset of devaluing those that are poor, a different race, a different religion, etc. can allow us to be more comfortable making decisions about the taking of the lives of others.

This does not mean if you believe in the death penalty you are a bigot or racist or ignorant in any way. Many whites get executed in southern states after all.

Why Liberals?
To get back to the question.

Why are liberals generally opposed to the death penalty?

Because liberals believe in a social contract ? that everyone has a right to life, liberty and property (not slavery). And that a central authority is required to maintain those rights to all. In our natural state, humans retract to self-preservation as goal number one, despite any cost to others on many levels. In general, liberals fight for the welfare of all people and an equality that would not exist without a central authority or government to protect it.

That right to life, that protection of equality is driven by a believe of valuing all people in the society and helping them not only gain and protect certain natural rights, but also an ability to understand humans are flawed. Humans make mistakes. There is a larger belief in rehabilitation and forgiveness amongst liberals.

Liberals also look at the poorest in society as being disadvantaged at no fault of their own. Conservatives believe, to a higher degree, that anyone in society can transcend whatever environment they are born into, for better or worse.

If you fight for the wellbeing of society as a whole, then you also fight to correct the flaws in that society. If you for the rights of the individual above the rights of the society then you may be more inclined to support the death penalty as a more selfish act.

This is not to say that conservatives do not care about other people and that liberals are better people. These believes are built over lifetimes from nurturing to education to friends, family, and life events.

If you know someone who was convicted of a crime and imprisoned you may build a stronger belief that criminals can be rehabilitated. If you are attacked on the street violently and mugged, you may support harsher penalties under the law for criminals. And if you have a brush with death yourself, you may value all life more, appreciating how precious life really is.

It Is Not A Simple Subject
The issue is also not black and white, liberals against, conservatives in favor. Many humans fall somewhere in a grey area. Bill Clinton, liberal and Democratic President, supported the death penalty and strengthened the federal law. The Republican Party was founded in large degree to end slavery.

Politics change just as the people they represent tend to change their views as their lives progress. In one direction or the other.

The support for the death penalty decreases each year. Last year it was down to 61%. Americans are also increasingly moving to cities more and more, just like the rest of the world. Cities are in general much more liberal populations than rural areas. Cities require more public systems for the good of the whole. As this trend and others continue, the support for the death penalty will likely continue to decrease over the next several decades.

For consumers there will be more and more improvements on mobile, UI, and ease of use to produce dynamic content on an ever expanding number of social networks. We have yet to find the maximum number of social networks consumers are willing to maintain. The average continues to go up.

Facebook growth suffers from this. Though they are still innovating enough to survive as the king of the hill.

But realize, most Facebook users are on at least one other social network on a regular basis. Pinterest, G+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, etc, etc all are seeing consistent growth.

Retail Social Media

This is not to say social media for stores selling goods. Retail, as in retail politics. Hand to hand social media. Closer and closer to one on one, highly targeted messaging.

The more targeted content is the more effective the message, the ask.

Automation is getting better and better. As is CRM. Plug these two systems together and you have more relevant touchpoints with more potential customers, and excellent traffic to understand it all.

I know some people think social networks and social media tools will start consolidating, but this is not going to happen. Social media is fragmented and will remain so. There will not be another Facebook, instead there will be several Facebooks, and several tools that can help you manage those channels.

Targeting is the key. This is why FBX retargeting ads just rolled out to the Facebook newsfeed. This is why Facebook ads are so powerful, and when done right, can generate email marketing sized ROI numbers.

The real return in social media comes when targeting and consumer intelligence meet with a savvy marketer and savvy tools. Savvy because they can point highly relevant messaging to those consumers, and reap the benefits. See dark Facebook posts. See Facebook Power Editor. See retargeting.

Take a community manager. Train them how to use social ads. And you have a powerful sales machine. 

Content will increasingly be customized for a smaller and smaller audience segment.

Jason-Keath,"There are a few numbers that are important to this questions:

Duplicate accounts
If we are talking about ""fake"" the same 10Q filing explains that 4.8% are duplicates. The word fake would not be accurate here. These are real people using the site for multiple purposes. Should they count toward a monthly active user count of 955 million (as of now)? No. But they are relevant for advertisers.

Misrepresented accounts
Another 2.4% are people using personal accounts as a business name, like Sarah's Bakery. These are typically small businesses and the owner or one employee owns this account to promote their business. These are also not fake. They are people using the site and still useful for marketers, though the ad targeting gets cloudy. I also think these people should not be counted toward the Facebook MAU count.

Spammers
Lastly you have the 1.5% undesirable accounts. The main example Facebook gives for this classification is that they are spamming accounts.

At 1.5%, this is the real number of fake accounts.

Facebook has 14.3 million fake monthly active users.

Again, for marketers, this number is not too bad. Compare to Google results, email messages, and Twitter, this percentage is pretty respectable. Twitter is much much worse, some estimates project 30% to 60% of active Twitter accounts are fake profiles.

Jason-Keath,"Great question. We have covered this topic and several similar ones at events and with some of our online articles. I think the best plan I have seen are these 6 steps by Instagram expert, Brian Difeo.

Source (with permission): http://socialfresh.com/instagram...



1. Jumpstart with Existing Audiences
An initial push to your community is a great start. Announce your presence on Instagram using your current channel, some examples:
email lists
newsletter
website
Facebook
Twitter
signage

2. Content + Engagement
Don?t just post a photo because you haven?t in a while. Do not treat Instagram as just a channel to occasionally push extra photos to. Post engaging content that grabs emotion.


3. Have a Content Plan
No spreadsheets here. Just be consistent, posting 3-4 photos a day, spread out over the course of the day.

4. Utilize Relevant Hashtags
Search hashtags that are relevant to your brand (such as #fashion, #design, #beauty) and engage with users.

5. Consider Running a Contest
Take engagement to the next level with a contest or competition.

6. Partner with Instagram Influencers
Hire or partner with an influential Instagramer to cover an event or guest-photograph on your account.

And there is a 7th here

  "
Jason-Keath,"Promoted posts are best for increasing engagement. This is a middle of the funnel technique, somewhat different than spending for fan acquisition. Getting content in the newsfeed of more of your fans could greatly help your conversion efforts down the line, but is something that should be tested.

The promoted post ad product is very similar to sponsored stories. It is, as you point out, a little pricier. And the other main difference is the content shows up in the newsfeed (and therefor mobile) and not the sidebar. The awareness opportunity the newsfeed provides is better and more visible than the sidebar. But again, that is something each business needs to test to see if it is worth the money.

Promoted posts are also an easier option for many page admins than sponsored stories. The learned curve is not as steep.

In general, anyone that has measurement and analysis setup well, should test if the promoted posts feature can create a long term boost in their fan engagement and then measure if that fan engagement is giving them a bigger return and more conversions. My guess for most businesses, the promoted post feature can be a great short term spend to up their edgerank, increase their awareness and engagement, and ultimately help their conversion efforts.
  "
Jason-Keath,"It is hard to know what to advise without know how many audience segments and ad images/headlines/copy options you tried. Facebook ads perform best when there is the most relevance. You can make an ad more relevant with the offer, the audience, and the ad creative.

If you feel good about the testing you did, putting a bit more budget behind your top performer is a good idea. Your cost per click should go down a bit. Just keep an eye on the performance each day. Ad performance can drop off quickly after 48-72 hours.
  "
Jason-Keath,"Facebook's promoted post feature seems to still be rolling out. Access is given per person and not per page. So if someone has access to the feature, they have access to it for all the pages they admin. I still know several people who cannot see the feature yet. Regardless of the fan number.

It is the case that if you have less than 400-500 fans the feature is not eligible, even if you can access it on other pages.

Jason-Keath,"1. Look close ? Start with the resources and people closest to your brand or organization.
Use http://export.ly, free if your Twitter followers are less than 10,000, to find more data about the users following you on Twitter, including those who are following you back and how many followers they have.
Look to services like Flowtown (paid) to get more data from your existing email newsletter subscribers.
Use Rapportive as a gmail plugin to learn more about the people you talk to through email every day.
Look into the data you gather through your CRM software.
Look to new customers, employees, loud customers, and grieving customers (grieving customers are ones that have had bad service experiences). These people are the closest to you and have the largest potential for championing your brand.


2. Research communities ? People are gathering around your topic on Facebook, Twitter, blogs and more. Find these communities, contribute to them, research them.
Blogdash is a paid service that will help you research bloggers in rich details.
Find leaders of Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, hashtag chats, forums, etc. Reach out to them and let them.
Technorati is a free service that lists blogs according to topic and popularity.
Find a leading industry community, blog or forum. Search them for blogrolls (list of related blogs), comment strings, list of members, most active members, or community leaders. Repeat this step as you explore and define the topic's ecosystem of websites and influencers.
Use Rowfeeder, a paid but affordable monitoring service, to search a relevant Twitter hashtag over the course of a few weeks. Sort the gathered data for users that are contributing the most, getting the most retweets, and have the most followers.
Use sites and tools like SocialMention.com, WeFollow.com, Daylife.com, and Alltop.com  for top users in your category.
Explore relevant tags on Delicious.com to find the most bookmarked blog posts on the topic you are exploring.

3. Ask for help ? Networking and asking for help from broader communities is one of the more successful research methods for searching for influencers.
Ask communities such as Twitter or Quora for suggestions on who they view as influencers as a topic
Ask existing customers, brand champions, and influencers you are already in contact with
Ask your employees what they read and who they listen to on the topic
Hire someone to find influencers for you Klout offers this as a paid service. Or search for outreach agencies and consultants on http://Investinsocial.com

Jason-Keath,"What a big question. I will try to stay high level here and not get too anthropological.

EMOTIONS
I think it is important, to consider and answer this question, to understand the purpose of emotion in humans as social animals. Emotion is directly tied to motivation (they are both derived from the latin movere, to move). The precursor to action is emotion. It's purpose, emotion, in many ways, is to protect us and our species. It is the evolutionary boot code. It tells us what to do at a core level to survive.
Fear causes us to flee and live another day
Sadness and crying (an emotional expression) causes other humans to help us, to aid us, to physically or emotionally heal us. Health equals life.
Love as a connection is an attachment to family or other members of society. It makes us more likely to support and defend those we deem closest to us. It is a cooperative action, ensuring we will have support in return.
Love for a mate drives us to procreate, support our mate, and extend our species.

These are powerful, ancient forces at play in the chemicals of our brain. At a very primal level, emotions are what helps us make simple survival decisions.

Obviously the way we use emotion in smaller human interactions that are not life or death does not necessarily determine our survival. But that is the origin of emotion and the core to our social society. Humans are a social animals. The key to social animals and the complexity of the societies they form is cooperation. Thriving as a group. Without working together our species ends. So emotion, as our toolbox for social cooperation, is not only an ancient driving force, it is not going away any time soon.

FACTS
Ok, quite a preface there on emotion. Now facts are much simpler. While emotion is not going anywhere, humans have indeed evolved as individual thinkers. Facts should be truths or proven information. If facts were indeed this simple, always proven, always truths, they may stand a more consistent chance against our powerful emotional drivers.

But, facts are just as often theory as they are proven pieces of information. The creativity of our language and communication often relegates fact or logic as one piece of a puzzle that is able to be positioned and leveraged for our end goal. Logic is often at the whim of grammar (the symbols we choose to represent facts) and rhetoric (persuasion).

I would further argue, that facts can motivate us as much as emotion, but typically only when those facts have equal or greater emotions attached, either by relevance or by the grammar and rhetoric of others.
  "
Jason-Keath,"I think many dinner clubs and scientific societies were after some of the very things we turn to social media for today. Connections, discussions, pulling together people from various locations to one central meetings for group benefit, networking, building stronger social relationships, exploring topics of interest, building new schools of thought, etc, etc.

In some ways these groups are more than what Quora is. Quora is a crowdsource Q&A site. We don't ask about each other's families and businesses and sit and discuss our latest idea for an invention. The social scale of groups like these has much more depth.

The similarities are interesting to examine. Obviously, pulling together the insights of people from various specialities and geographies in one, democratic forum is very similar to what these groups likely did informally.

Maybe if we can get Quora to add some table wine, tabaco pipes, and ample candle light we would be a bit closer.
  "
Jason-Keath,"Give. Give of your self. Give to friends. Give to strangers. Give your expertise, your time, your advice, your money, your heart. Generosity breeds relationships.
Invent. Offer a skill, product or service that no one else can, or in a way that no one else does. Build a business or organization around that. Build an empire around that.
Innovate. Becoming an expert on a topic is not easy necessarily. But, there is a line that if you read the top three books on any niche subject you will be smarter than 99% of the people in the world. Apply your own unique thinking, concepts, hypothesis and you become a thought leader. Act on those unique concepts and you become an innovator.
Lead a community of people. Lead a cause. Organize others to act, to support brilliant movements. To help others.
Invest. Beyond giving, support others. Help them actually improve their lives. Help them solve the biggest problems in their lives or their business.
Have an opinion. People listen to confidence. People like to be told what to do. They are searching for trusted sources. While you can never be a trusted source to everyone, meaning lots of folks will think you are wrong from time to time, you cannot influence anyone if you don't start with an opinion first. Say something and believe it. Say something new and people will listen even more.

1. Strategists (leaders)
Commonly a VP role at many agencies and brands, this person controls the overall strategy behind all social media. They control the goals, the platforms, the campaigns, the budgets, the staffing and commonly manage a team. Multiple levels of strategists exists at many companies.

Common Titles:

EVP
SVP
VP
Brand Manager
Brand Team Leader
Project Leader
Any Agency

2. Community Managers (PR, customer relations)
This is the front lines. Bloggers, Twitter users, Facebook page managers, social media monitoring experts, etc. They control and measure the public interactions of a business and their stakeholders. They create content, build relationships, track reactions, direct customer service response, drive brand awareness, and build brand personalities that help the business succeed on many fronts. They monitor results of these activities and report to the strategists.


Common Titles:
Community Manager
Monitoring Specialist
Customer Service Specialist
SEO Specialist
PR Agency

3. Campaign Managers (analysis, advertising) 
These are the guys that deliver the reports on the big numbers, the ROI, they setup the advertising and large campaigns that drive numbers to the blog, Facebook page, and email signups. They push campaigns that drive stakeholders from one community to another. They make conversions happen, analyze the results and report to the strategists.
Common Titles:
Analyst
Lead Gen/Sales Manager
Email Marketer
PPC Manager
Advertising Manager
App Developer

4. Support Roles
Designers, developers, copywriters.

Summary
A lot of this is the distinction between how ad agencies and pr agencies are initially addressing social. For instance, ad agencies will take control of a Facebook page through an ad budget and work to grow a very large fan audience through Facebook ads and convert them to email subscribers or a sales conversion or hold on to them for future projects. Many PR agencies will focus on building an authentic community management voice, an organic community, and solid, creative content delivery through status updates. Both of these perspectives are needs and in the best agencies, ad and PR, both are represented.

These guys are more a reflection of a larger shift I think.

When you hit bottom there is only one way to go and that is up. And, of course, Ford never hit bottom. But as a whole, the American auto industry has begun to take seriously the kinds of changes the consumer is demanding. Embracing social media is one of those steps. Truly embracing new technology (Onstar improvements and the launch of MyFord Touch), investing in true green options (Chevy Volt and Ford Focus Electric), and making large changes in manufacturing and corporate structure.

Also note the overall tone of the auto industry has changed. It is a humble voice in many commercials these days.

The moves of GM alone have gone a long way, making such a large organizational shift and paying back a massive debt to the government that many people probably wrote off as lost money.

Jason-Keath,"To me it reflects the need to create a balance between two people who have just finished a value exchange. The need for reciprocity, to even the scales, to make sure nothing is owed from either to the other before parting ways. Perhaps it comes from trade customs, bartering ? two strangers or acquaintances needing to verbally state a closing balance of transactions.

You're welcome means ""freely granted"", the positive side of the statement. Though, a sense of charity is implied there in the objective use.

The other side of the coin ""no problem"" or ""not at all"" is the negative version, meaning ""no you do not owe me anything, now let's move on with the day.""
My preference is ""my pleasure"" a positive spin on the balanced scales implying all is well and in fact, I enjoyed the interaction.

Jason-Keath,"Corporate blogs are difficult. Usually much harder than most companies think. It comes down to two things...

1. Planning A Content Strategy - Most companies think just putting up a few blog posts here or there will get them traction in social media. And while there is a little value in this 'news channel' or 'hunt and peck' style of blogging, it does little to generate real business results.

Companies need a clear content strategy. Answer these questions to find your content strategy:
What end business goal will the blog serve?
Who do we need to accomplish that goal?
Where do we find those people (Facebook, Forums, SEO)?
What content do those people want to share?
What will our content say about a person when they share it with others? (I am funny, I am smart, I am a trendsetter, etc)

Then figure out frequency. A great blog post can take hours. A strong blog community takes daily moderation. You want to be posting 3-5 times a week to generate a large active blog community. This is a ""great"" corporate blog, only if the content is shareable and creates conversation. The two usually go hand in hand.

Frequency begets staffing and assignments and technology needs. These logistics lead you to setting a clear editorial calendar, meaning someone who owns that calendar, an editor, needs to be involved.

From there you have a stable base you can build a great blog from. These are the planning and logistical steps necessary for a corporate blog to truly have a chance to see a return.

2. Building Community (or Audience) - They say there is no accounting for taste. And they are right. Meaning. Plan all you want, but your community is the best guide to what makes your blog great. What content you give them and how often is a bigger generator of community than your comments and interaction with them on the blog.

If they love your press releases for some reason, then focus on that. If they love lists or interviews or video or coupons, feed them what they respond to. A few keys...
Surprise your audience
Give them things they can consume easily (lists, video, photos, how-tos)
Give them things they want to share (again, what does your content say about them?)
Always test and listen to what gets the best response and focus there

Also, your community is your best asset to making the blog better. Empower them, not just by listening to them, but by giving them ownership as well. The comments are their forum. Celebrate the most active. Give them roles. Allow participation in unique ways.

Lastly, involve more than one person. the only reason a corporate blog should be produced by just one person is if that is the only employee. Use the manpower of your company to your advantage to:
Provide more content with a larger breadth of perspective
Promote the blog with a larger core network
Start with a community of stakeholders from day one

If you are a small business, focus on your customers for the 3 bullet points above.

a) *Did* have significant revenues:
Netscape (the same company as Mosaic, btw) made $400M in revenue the first 9 months of 1997: http://sec.edgar-online.com/nets...
Geocities (This is a guess, but I bet that traffic made Yahoo! a boatload of money back when banner dollars were easy to get. Maybe not enough to justify the $3.5B acquisition price, but that wasn't the question. Anyone know?)
Shutterfly (see comment above)

b) Didn't really have a lot of users. (What's ""a lot"" anyway?)
4chan?

c) Got bought, ran out of funding due to dot-com crash, or sued out of existence before they tried in earnest to monetize. None of these are the same as ""failing"" to monetize.
Geocities (Even if not really in category A under Yahoo's regime, they are here.)
Almost everyone else mentioned

Possible exceptions (don't really know the story on either of these, but I doubt it):
JenniCam (was she a company?)
DejaNews (did they have any users?)
Ning (I think they were growing well for a while, not sure what happened exactly.)

Having a large number of users and the inability to monetize them is a non-existent problem. People talk about it all the time, but it doesn't really happen?at least it doesn't happen in today's world. I'm not even sure it ever did. Sure, there were Internet companies that went out of business because they were losing too much money, but I think usually they didn't *really* have a lot of users (just a lot of hype) or they had out of control costs.

Dave-Morin,"3 reasons:

First, we are now in the Post-PC, Mobile era. In the PC era we would often ask: are you online or offline? In the Mobile era this is no longer the case. You are simply sleeping or awake.

Second, because we now carry our mobile devices everywhere, they have become the best way to journal all of the important personal information from our lives. There is a trend around personal health applications which help you live healthier happier lives. Sleep data has been an interesting part of this trend, and something we thought would be nice to start with on Path.

Third, users tell us that they love getting our notifications during the day, but at night they would prefer if the notifications were not streaming in. Sleep also provides utility by turning off notifications while you are asleep.

But focusing on Gladwell is to totally miss the point.

K/virality is essentially of course how many additional users one new user will bring organically. But viral cycle time is even more important. If it takes a year for each user that invites another to do so, you will have very low growth!

Plus both factors multiply non-viral growth (e.g. paid marketing) and so it's more enlightening to determine an ""amplification factor"" overall and then factor for cycle time, i.e.:

153.....Backtweets (and they suggest there may be more)
147.....Topsy
106.....bit.ly
56-86 Twitter search (depending on search query),

Influence and persuasion are two children of the same family. Influencers are persuader and persuaders are liked. Hey, that's the reason they were able to persuade you in the first place.

Your influence is not defined by the influencer, it's defined by the influenced and interpreted by the observers. What makes you a persuader? In other words, what makes you an influencer?

Your influence and likability factor is wrap is the benefit those you influence see in your contribution, expertise, proof, application and frequency. In other words, you contribute to a community in a way that establishes your expertise. Are you are able to present a social proof of your expertise in action, or direct beneficial result from your expertise? The next element is the applicability of your expertise in the lives of the the potentially influenced. The last element is, how visible and accessible are you?

The Third Wave of the Web Will Be Uniquely Personal
http://blog.louisgray.com/2010/1...

In a world of streams, where it becomes impossible to follow every single item from every single source, artificial intelligence is required to deliver true recommendations and relevance for every individual. Companies are spending millions on optimizing their Web sites for search engines, but not developing the same level of focus for users when they finally visit.

Thanks to this big trend, I joined My6sense (product) as VP of Marketing in August 2010 - after seeing the problem myself and seeing many proposed solutions. (Consider that disclosure)

Personalization impacts the world of mobile, curation, artificial intelligence and human augmentation (all listed here). If we are to be constantly connected, the best stuff should find us through our own implicit behavior and preferences. This, I believe, is the next big trend on the Web.

In contrast, Google+ Circles are used for both consumption and distribution, which makes them much more powerful, and useful. Instead of choosing the all private or all public approach as Twitter does, you can send specific posts to a specific subset of connections, all filtered through Circles.

Given the inherent value of sharing through Circles, and how it matches real human social behavior, I believe Circles has a higher chance of success. Google has also made the process of editing people's Circles, or the Circles themselves, easy and entertaining, less like a chore.

Louis-Gray,"After nearly six months' exposure to ChromeOS via the CR-48 pilot program, I would have to say absolutely. The question is to the ""direction"" of Google's plan, not the immediate first quarter commercial success, which will get a fair amount of discussion in the press.

We are increasingly making our Web browser our hub for computing activity. Programs that were once exclusive to the desktop are now Web apps, Web services or Web sites. We use our Web browser full screen with little need to leave.

In addition to the Web-centric model, Google has done three things right with ChromeOS which are brilliant in my opinion:

Promoting 3G access. Once you have Web access everywhere, the freedom to act on anything in your car, at the park, or anywhere you can get a 3G signal is liberating.
Tremendous battery life. I always have my MacBook Air plugged in and it goes barely two hours (maybe) on a charge. The CR-48 and the new Chromebooks are much more like tablets and can go 8 hours of real use.
User independence. I can sign into any Chromebook and get my data, bookmarks, etc. I can add my wife or friends as users on my laptop and not worry about them compromising my data. And if my device is lost or stolen, my data is not at risk. This changes the game.

Google has not said Chromebooks are for everyone. There are some who need Photoshop or Xcode or who knows what else and can't migrate. Others are stuck at a sticker price of as much as $499 + monthly 3G fees and compare that to low-end Windows notebooks. But this is absolutely the right direction. I am using my CR-48 more and more vs my Mac and Windows laptops.

Louis-Gray,"I am not Roman Catholic, but in a recent discussion of this topic, it was brought up that it's quite possible Jesus had instructed Peter to deny him thrice. We have been raised to think Peter did so to save his own skin, but instead, Jesus, wanting to keep the gospel's line of succession intact upon his imminent crucifixion, had given Peter direct instructions, along the lines of ""Thou shalt deny me three times"".

The scriptures (Luke 22:34) say as follows:
http://lds.org/scriptures/nt/luk...

""I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me""

This puts Peter's assumed betrayal in a much different light.

It's not about building a personal brand, or trying to curry favor or freebies from companies, but engaging in dialog with the people who are shaping what's new and what's next. While my blog has mostly been a hobby for the last five years, it has helped me bridge between one industry (hardware) and move toward another (Web/software) which previously might not have been possible.

From 2006-09, when I was at my last company, I always said the blog was about the next job, not the current job. Turned out to be true, even if I wasn't sure at the time.

http://blog.louisgray.com/2009/1...

Cadmus essentially groups the most talked about links and tweets in your Twitter stream, from the last time you logged in. For example, a tweet may show that it gained 15 replies and 9 related posts (sharing the same link). That's a very helpful tool, one that relies mostly on social signals, helping to reduce duplicate links, while leveraging collaborative filtering to bring top shares to the top.

In contrast, My6sense (product) looks almost exclusively at implicit signals from an individual's use of the system (Twitter in this case vs Cadmus). What the user reads or skips indicates some level of interest in the individual tweet, and the data around that tweet gives a hint as to the user's choice. (The sender, the keywords, the link, relative time, etc.)

In addition, on Twitter.com, my6sense also takes user's explicit behavior into account, including retweets, replies, favorites, etc. to help expand the person's ranking model. At no time does my6sense actually ""filter"" the tweets, but instead it reranks them all, starting with the top one being assumed to be the most relevant due to the users' previous behavior.

There is no question we are not alone in desiring access to a future Quora API.

Louis-Gray,"The best tool I have seen to measure anybody's RSS feed growth or trajectory is BlogPerfume's Feed Analysis. http://www.blogperfume.com/feed-...

Louis-Gray,"One's preferences in terms of tech, be it hardware, software, OS, Web services or mobile phones is a personal choice based on their own experience. I tend to be biased in favor of how much I would personally enjoy a product, moreso than trying to predict its business success. Robert, similarly, blends emotion with his experience, and that shows in some of the decisions he makes.

With FriendFeed in particular, I was bullish on the site before Robert and helped bring him to the network. For a long time, he and I both were evangelizing the network, but its lack of growth in the face of growth on Twitter and Facebook helped erode his efforts there (he can explain more if I say this wrong.)

On Google Buzz, the popular opinion is that it has not been successful. What I have found is a very similar experience to FriendFeed in a new place. It too has not won the numbers battle, but I also believe time there will not have been wasted when Google continues its social efforts.

On Android and iPhone, I was once as bullish on iPhone as Robert is now. I made a personal switch following the Google IO conference, their previews, and a lackluster response to the iPhone 4. Since then, I have felt confident about the direction of the industry, and also believe Apple is extremely secure with strong customers such as Robert.

Robert and I are peers on the blogs and social networks, though his reach will likely outstrip mine forever. As we walk in similar spaces, we will absolutely disagree in the future and that is just fine.

Louis-Gray,"If you live in the US and have a Spotify account already, there are few hurdles to adding the service to Sonos. I have had Sonos and Spotify working together since August of this year, and wrote on the integration in early September.

Louis-Gray,"Services I use are varied based on their function. There's no magic, just consistency.

As Robert Diana noted, I do use Google Reader throughout the day to catch up on hundreds of blogs. I tend to skim most, share a few and read the full context for many. Increasingly, especially on mobile devices, I am relying on My6sense (product) to surface the best stuff for me - which is why I joined them as VP of Marketing in August.

In addition to Google Reader...

I use Icerocket.com to track mentions and links, as it is the best Blog Search and Realtime Search on the Web. I use Google Alerts as well, but find this less useful.

I use SiteMeter and ChartBeat to see realtime visitors to the blog and their origin, which helps me find new links and new services.

I use Tweetie for Mac to read and manage multiple Twitter accounts.

I use Twitter, Facebook (product), FriendFeed, and Google Buzz to see what the world is saying and sharing. Clearly, I use Quora as well, as more people from my social graph and important business and tech leaders participate.

My blog is hosted by Blogger (product) and I use the Samsung Galaxy Tab and the Epic 4G for mobile connections. Both are powered by Android (OS), which has built in notifications for mentions on Twitter, and updates via E-mail and Facebook.

The best way to find stories is to observe for new things and interact with the entrepreneurs by email and phone, beyond scanning referral logs and watching for stray social media mentions. If I do find I think I have something new that has not been reported, I check both Google Blogsearch and Icerocket to see if I am new to the game. This increases the chance I will write.

Major reasons for the site's continued interest include the forming of niche communities, powerful aggregation tools, advanced search capabilities, high quality filtering, direct messaging and private and public groups.

Many of FriendFeed's best qualities, which were once clearly ahead of the pack in 2007 and 2008, are now visible in Google Buzz and Facebook (product), as well as other sites. But in combination, the power users of the site find it extremely flexible and many will no doubt be using it until it's no longer available, should that ever occur.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"I'm very fond of this quote from Louis C.K. below and generally view the world through this lens:

I never viewed money as being ""my money"" I always saw it as ""The money"" It's a resource. if it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system.

In other words, Cari and I are stewards of this capital. It's pooled up around us right now, but it belongs to the world. We are not perfect in applying this attitude, but we try very hard.

All that said, it turns out to be quite difficult to flush such a large sum back into the world in a way you can feel confident about, which is why we started Good Ventures (http://www.goodventures.org/) and work so closely with GiveWell. But we're learning more and more every day and accelerating our pace as we do. We intend not to have much left when we die (i.e. we have a ""burn down"" foundation).

Update: A few people have commented or sent me private messages along the lines of ""businesses can do good for the world too! don't just give it all away!"" I want to be clear that I agree 100% with that viewpoint. I personally work full time on building Asana because I agree so strongly (Solving the ultimate meta-problem at The Asana Blog). I also have many decades to invest my capital before the ""burn down"" aspect even starts to meaningfully limit the opportunities I can pursue on the business side. We've even already made one very notable investment from the foundation side of our world (Vicarious Raises $15M Led By Good Ventures To Build Software That ?Learns Like A Human?).

But I see no strong reasons to try to set up a system that perpetually invests this capital after I die, so I'd like to be rid of it before then (much like Warren Buffett). Further, even the money we grant will inevitably be re-invested in the economy somehow; it has not been ""consumed"". So, I'm just giving other people a chance to be stewards of the capital in the long run, to re-grant it or invest as they see fit.
  "
Dustin-Moskovitz,"Based on my experience, the company size is not the most salient a factor in making the decision. It's more a question of how much you care about providing this benefit and how feasible it is to have a real kitchen where you work. I suspect the asker was trying to get at cost-effectiveness, but my guess is it is always more expensive than catering until you have hundreds of employees, and obviously it is more expensive than not providing meals at all at any scale.

Asana has had prepared meals since day 1, when Justin and I worked out of his apartment in Palo Alto. We had a part time assistant who was also a skilled chef, and she would cook us simple meals out of her kitchen. This was easy, incredibly convenient, and not very expensive.

When we moved to San Francisco, we started in an office that did not have a kitchen. Our assistant moved with us and still managed to cook pretty great meals using a combination of preparing some things at her own home and skillfully using an electric hotplate at work to finish them. By the time we were around 10 employees, this was enough work to justify our first full time chef, the incredible Donnie Thompson.

The hot plate was clearly limiting and not likely to scale, so when we were looking for our second office, having access to a kitchen was one of our top priorities. At a few places I investigated the possibility of installing a kitchen, but this was almost always prohibitively expensive at the scale we had then (hundreds of thousands of dollars up to a full million), particularly if you have to install exhaust, and most landlords weren't willing to consider it at all. At points, we felt we would need to give up and adopt catering, but we were very fortunate to find the Hamms building, which had an existing industrial kitchen on the first floor previously used by Pasta Pomodoro. The building was otherwise great and in the right price range, so we jumped on the opportunity. We've been there for 3 years already, and just signed a new 5-year lease, so this is our home for the foreseeable future.

At around 20 employees, we hired a second chef. With any operational position in a startup, I find you often need to go from 1->2 people pretty early, since it's really hard to deal with sicknesses and vacations otherwise and a team quickly becomes more than the sum of its parts for a number of reasons (energy++, bouncing ideas off each other, etc). This also enabled us to add to the quality of the service, e.g. by adding a Friday breakfast and afternoon snacks. At 60 employees, we recently hired a third full time chef to help us scale and to further improve the food service. We also have some part-time hourly members of the team who do prep work and dishwashing.

Whenever other entrepreneurs ask me about this benefit, I answer that I unequivocally feel it is worth the cost. Our food is amazing every single day and our employees greatly appreciate having it. Most will answer it is the company perk they most enjoy by a wide margin. However, I think we are very lucky to have found the Hamm's building w/ an available kitchen lease. If you are not similarly lucky, then you basically need to wait until a $300-$600k additional expense does not feel unreasonable added on to whatever office buildout you are already doing. Probably you would be 100+ employees and even then it will certainly be a big hit on your bank account.
  "
Dustin-Moskovitz,"The single most important thing by a large margin we need to do to fight against animal cruelty is change our eating habits. Animal cruelty laws around pets are not perfect, but they are pretty good. Animal testing is not great, but the number of animals in those situations is relatively limited.

There are, however, billions of animals going through the industrial food system every year, in the US alone. If you could change the standard of care for those animals, you would be reducing animal suffering tremendously.

You can also have a meaningful impact by changing your own habits, since the average American is consuming dozens of animals per year. If you're not sensitive to how these animals are sourced, you are quite likely causing animal cruelty yourself, on a meaningfully large scale.

So, how can you fight this?
1/ Become a vegetarian or vegan.
2/ If you're an omnivore like me, care about purchasing and eating humanely raised meat. Unless you think the entire world population will switch to vegetarianism, it's critical that more omnivores eat mindfully to create a real market for this. Many terms like ""free range"" have been greenwashed and are not meaningful. I've found I need to actually know the names of the local farms that I trust to be confident. The vast vast majority of meat is not humanely raised, even by relatively low standards. Don't eat fast food at all (with rare exceptions like Chipotle, but even they aren't ideal).
3/ Again for omnivores, reduce your meat consumption. Even idyllic standards are not going to be perfect and this will help you naturally avoid the problem.
4/ Support legislation that enforces higher farming standards.

To be clear, I did take Intro to Comp Sci while I was an undergrad at Harvard (CS50) and that was a great foundation of knowledge to build on. I do not advise that people forgo formal education when it's an option. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that teachers are really great at helping you learn things.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"Regardless of the long term potential, I believe Bitcoin is currently quite a bit overhyped and agree with the wise Paul Buchheit in this tweet:

More evidence that it is not a currency:

""Actually, the question is whether anyone will actually use bitcoins to buy things at all. It's not clear why they would when its value can go from $500 to $900 in a matter of hours. Nor when so many people treat it as an inflation hedge. They think of Bitcoin more as an investment than as money. Indeed, researchers from the University of California-San Diego and George Mason University found that 64 percent of all bitcoins are being hoarded in accounts that have never been spent. And of the bitcoins that are being spent, a full 60 percent are on the gambling site Satoshi Dice."" - The Atlantic, ""Bitcoin is the Segway of Currency""

Until that changes, I think it's premature to talk about it as an alternative to the money supply and creation system in the US, or anywhere. It is much more a medium for gambling than the medium of transfer of wealth suggested in the question comments.

I generally like the idea of experimentation in markets of all kinds, so I don't want to paint the picture that I'm against bitcoin, but I don't see evidence for the optimism the question asker implies wrt solving the problems of the current banking system (or society). It's not a panacea. In fact, I think there is a serious potential to cause harm to the average American if a large chunk of the transaction market becomes opaque to the government, since it will result in tax evasion, potentially at large scale. Regardless of how I feel about individual tax laws, it is critical that they apply consistently to everyone in order to have a functioning democracy and welfare state. Moving a large part of the economy into the black market is a step towards anarchy, even if it is also a step towards freedom.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"I apologize in advance as this may seem like a non-answer, but in my view the question is misguided. There is an implication that the speech led to the creation of Facebook or to Mark dropping out and if this is true at all, it is only in a very minor or indirect sense. I can only assume the question is derived from the movie The Social Network, where the speech plays a central role.

As far as I know, as with most of the facts from that movie, this event did not even occur (see also Dustin Moskovitz: According to Dustin Moskovitz, what are some of the inaccuracies in the movie The Social Network?). I can find no reference online to a speech in the right time frame, nor do I recall Mark ever mentioning it.

[Update: Boz says in the comments that the speech did occur and that ""it was interesting and entertaining but not inspiring.""]

That said, inspiring speakers regularly came to Harvard, telling students to go forth and do great things, and I think it's reasonable to view that scene as symbolic of the set. If you'd like to have a similar experience, consider watching the Steve Jobs' Stanford commencement:

Dustin-Moskovitz,"I recommend Javascript (client AND server), which is what we use at Asana. Javascript is the language of the browser, so all interactive web applications basically must use it. Most teams not using SSJS inevitably end up having to write large parts of their code twice (once in JS for the client, and once in python or whatever for the server), particularly around the data model. This becomes more and more true as you build towards a thick-client application, and Asana takes that to the extreme.

Javascript is almost nobody's first choice for language in the abstract, but being shipped with every browser trumps our other considerations. We are also experimenting with using a higher level language on the server that compiles to Javascript, like TypeScript.

That said, we don't *exclusively* use Javascript and in general I'm a ""the right tool depends on the job"" kind of guy. It is not appropriate, e.g., for our search indexing service. More detail on Asana: What technologies is Asana built with?

That said, I try to avoid making decisions myself as much as possible in favor of delegating them to the part of the team closest to the work. Jack has written a little more about that on Asana: Since Asana doesn't use titles, how is the organizational structure around roles and responsibility?

For example, our engineering roadmap is not put together by our engineering ""manager"" (Dustin) but instead by a series of committees on areas like performance and metrics, each staffed and chaired by different members of the engineering team. Certain members of the team ultimately commanding more seniority is inevitable and already present to some degree, but we try hard to emphasize each individual's particular axes of leadership rather than compare people.

In general, we have a preference for delegation and committees and the word ""strawman""  and collaborative Google Docs and of course using Asana to ensure important things getting done w/o anyone exercising ""final say"".

Dustin-Moskovitz,"Asana uses Asana very extensively, as you can imagine, so it's difficult to answer this question completely. Instead, I'll try to answer the specific questions you asked in the comments and then link out to more material.

Projects are sometimes a 1:1 correlation with a team. So, for example, we have a project called ""E7: Search"", which is all the tasks related to the search functionality we launched this week (Asana Search Views). The ""E7"" refers to the fact that we are currently in Episode 7 (Asana: How are Sprints & Episodes at Asana structured and how do they work?). Other than the engineers, pm, and designer working on search, almost nobody interacts with those tasks. Because we've now launched the functionality, we will likely archive this project, so it is ephemeral.

However, we will likely also have one-off search related tasks surface, usually either bug reports or small product improvements. Those will go into our long-lived projects Bugs and Product Details, respectively, and those projects are not associated with a specific team. The PMs triage them as appropriate, and we all share the work of completing items unrelated to an existing team (many during Polish week). If enough product details surface or we have some ideas about a new major direction to take search functionality and decide to staff a program team on it again, we'll create a new project in the future, e.g. ""E10: Search"". We'll probably start by going back to our E7: Search project and moving over some of the ideas we didn't get to. Alternatively, we may just rename ""E7: Search""->""E10: Search"" and archive the completed tasks. There's no material difference between those methods, imo.

Jackie has a good answer for projects vs. tags: Asana: When should you use tags vs. projects in Asana? A good heuristic I use is ""use projects when the priority of tasks within the project matters; use tags when you're simply trying to add information or want to be able to filter by some attribute"".

Dan Kaplan has written a summary of some of our primary use cases here: Asana: What are great uses for Asana?

Dustin-Moskovitz,"Since I'm called out in the description, I figured I'd throw in my two cents. There are a few different reasons we added people:
We wanted access to their advice and network in the classic investor sense. It is indeed hard to keep all of the investors in the loop enough to have context to provide good advice, which is unfortunate. However, I've found that I didn't accurately predict which ones we'd be in close contact with when we were getting started and in most cases the reason we're not further engaged has more to do with them than us (*they* have many investments, they moved out of the bay area, etc).
Many are friends. We knew we'd hang out with them anyway and would want to talk about the business. Aditya, Ruchi, Joe, Peter D; these guys aren't really active investors, though maybe that will change in the future. They just like to support their friends, and we like to be supported by them too. They also give great advice thanks to their own rich personal experiences. Jed Stremel and David Jeske are somewhat more active, but also are involved mainly bc we felt close to them and wanted them to be.
We thought there was a good chance we'd do a bigger round with them later and wanted to start the relationship early. Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Peter Thiel, and Matt Cohler were all part of our seed funding and are now much more involved through institutional investments. Notably, there are no institutional investors other than these guys.

It was a little annoying to do legal actions that required the participation of all the seed investors, but that really only came up once or twice (perhaps just for the Series A investment, if memory serves).

So my advice to other startups would be not to fear this approach too much, but remember to be balanced about it. 20+ does seem like it would be a bad trade-off, but 10-15 is probably fine.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"Here is our internal doc that explains No Meeting Wednesday:

The high level goal of NMW is to ensure that everyone gets a large block of time each week to do focused, heads-down work. The justification is well articulated in a now famous PG article: Maker?s Schedule, Manager's Schedule. The gist is that makers suffer greatly from interrupts in their flow time. Managers are generally used to having a schedule-driven day, so it?s easy for them to throw a disruption into somebody else?s calendar. Makers also do this to each other. And unlike many companies, at Asana we generally want our managers to be makers some of the time as well, so they need a structure that ensures they get some flow time too.

What are appropriate exceptions to the rule?
The high level answer is just use judgement, but please think carefully.

The thing that comes up most often is exogenous timing constraints of some kind. E.g. a candidate might only be able to do an interview on a Wednesday, in which case we?re willing to let their schedule take priority over ours.

You may also decide you want to work directly with someone else on a project (e.g. pair coding). This may still be worth avoiding somewhat to achieve the high level goal, but not totally. Often, this is necessary to unblock someone else, which is another form of exogenous time constraint in the end. And sometimes it?s just what you both need to do to finish your highest priority work and that?s ok.

Wherever possible though, we at least want people to try to avoid Wednesdays.

What if I don?t want to participate?
This would be ok, except that by definition a meeting involves someone else, too. It?s tempting to say ?well they can just push back if they want to?, but it is easy to construct situations where it wouldn?t feel culturally acceptable to do so, or an individual wouldn?t feel confident enough (e.g. a newer asana). So basically there is a slippery slope here and thus we want to be very (but not 100%) consistent.


Fittingly, this doc was written on a Wednesday.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"We like to move fast without breaking things. Asana: How are various features tested and moved to production at Asana? details how we do that, both with respect to iterating the product quickly w/o harming users and code stability.

Re: code stability, we fundamentally believe this is a false choice, because deploying regularly helps you build resilience towards bugs and instability. Eric Ries lays that argument out here: Why Continuous Deployment? We don't quite have continuous deployment, but we do push once a day during the week, largely to facilitate small batch sizes. As we grow, we'd like to push more frequently.

I'd say that even Facebook is benefiting quite a deal from that effect at this point, in spite of having much less mature testing infrastructure at the beginning. They are remarkably stable given how much they iterate and the size of the product engineering team and our processes mirror theirs in many ways (e.g. feature flags). The real point of ""break things"" in their culture is to inspire fearlessness, not recklessness, in my opinion, which is indeed a value we tried to transplant to Asana.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"We haven't said that we to kill all ""work about work"", but rather just the unnecessary parts. Reflection, like the kind found in the End of Episode Summary, is invaluable to any organization, and is worth spending real time doing.

Asana assisted me in writing the EOE in a few ways, mainly through some projects we use to keep track of events. E.g. we have a Launches project that has a row for each product feature we add, which I used to populate the top section of the doc. We also have a ""Production Incidents"" project that I referenced to create the list of problems in the the stability section. Last but not least, we have a project that lists all of our Key Results, with each one assigned to someone responsible for making it happen. Here is a screen shot from the E5 list:

  "
Dustin-Moskovitz,"Yes.

Here is how we described that traction with our last financing round in late July (http://blog.asana.com/2012/07/as... ):

""Incredibly, it?s been only nine months since we launched Asana. We are delighted every day by the impact Asana is having on teams around the world. Some specifics:
Since November, we?ve grown from a handful of teams to tens of thousands of teams trusting Asana to coordinate their efforts. They come from all over the world, and very diverse industries, including medical research, mobile networks, professional sports, political campaigns and of course, software and web development.
In April, we added Premium Workspaces, so larger teams could more easily expand their adoption of Asana, and in less than 90 days, hundreds of companies have already upgraded.
Most recently, we announced Inbox, our most ambitious product addition since launching. Inbox is an effort to re-imagine how teams communicate about their work, and reduces the time spent in email, the most notorious example of ?work about work?. The response to this new capability has been really incredible.
We are happy to see trends that point to Asana becoming the center of people?s work ? over a quarter of weekly users use Asana every single work day, Monday through Friday. And in the past 4 months alone, the number of tasks tracked in Asana had doubled from 9M to 18M.""
  "
Dustin-Moskovitz,"One of my favorite hacks is No Meeting Wednesdays, which we borrowed from Facebook. With very few exceptions, everyone's calendar is completely clear at least one day out of the week. Whether you are Maker or a Manager (http://www.paulgraham.com/makers...), this is an invaluable tool for ensuring you have some contiguous space to do project work. For me personally, it is often the one day each week I get to code.

This is explained a little further in Asana: How does Asana approach No Meeting Wednesday?

Daniel-Brusilovsky,"Much like what Benjamin Higginbotham said, Wirecast is a fantastic application. When I help people or companies with their live video production, if they're not using a white label or custom built solution, they probably use Ustream.

Telestream (the company that makes Wirecast) partnered up with Ustream to make the Ustream Producer application for Mac and Windows. It's essentially Wirecast, but only supports Ustream and has a few other nifty features.

Another interesting app is BoinxTV. Although they don't support live video streaming quite yet (I've heard it's coming), it does have a great user interface and makes it really easy to produce a video podcast, etc.

I've tried a bunch of other solutions, but at the end of the day, if you're using more then two or three cameras, you might want to considering using a hardware solution like the TriCaster, which is fantastic.
  "
Daniel-Brusilovsky,"In my opinion, Ustream is home to a lot of celebs (Lil Wayne, Lil Twist, Snoop Dogg), and I don't think that's going to change. Ustream has a vibrant fan community, and all of these celebs tie their Ustream channels into their Facebook pages, which is something that YouTube Live doesn't support quite yet.

On the other hand, I think YouTube Live will really be the platform for events now, especially large conferences, etc. I can definitely see TED using YouTube Live, over Ustream in the future.

Full disclosure: I was an early employee at Qik (acquired by Skype), which competes with Ustream. I was at Qik from 2007-2010.
  "
Daniel-Brusilovsky,"I don't want to speak for Qik, but in my opinion, it makes perfect sense. Qik is supported on hundreds of phones, as well as partnerships and integrations with carriers and OEM's. It's easier for Skype to acquire Qik to really get into mobile, than spend a year building it themselves. Plus, Qik's technology is quite impressive. Just my two cents.

Daniel-Brusilovsky,"Much like Robert's answer, it's not 100% necessary, but I think it's something that everyone should experience, if you have the ability.

When I was looking at my options during my senior year of high school, I was preparing myself to graduate, and start working somewhere full time. Then, I quickly realized that all my friends were going off to college. At that point, I felt like the odd man out.

I contemplated taking one year off, and then going to college, but I also realized that the chances that if I do take a gap year, and decide to go to college would be really low.

I may not be learning tons of new information in college, but I am experience college, which I think is the most important aspect of it. The experience of college is far greater then the education aspect, at least in my opinion.

To this day, I indeed do struggle with the thoughts of dropping out, because the work that I do at JESS3 and Teens in Tech Labs makes me so happy, and I want to be able to dedicate more time.

But, I am fortunate that I have the opportunity to go the college.

Daniel-Brusilovsky,"Back when I was still producing podcasts many moons ago, I had three main tools. To record, I used Sound Studio from Freeverse (http://www.freeverse.com/mac/pro...), which is great for just recording audio. After you have the audio, I would dump it into either GarageBand for some quick editing, or if I needed more editing, I would use something more complex like Fission from Rogue Amoeba (http://www.rogueamoeba.com/fission).

After all the editing was done, I put the audio file into The Levelator (http://www.conversationsnetwork....) to level out all the audio so it sounded nice and clean.

That was my process for almost three years!

Alex-Payne,"We're at a very early stage of development, so this may change, but for the moment we're using Scala, Clojure, and JRuby. We're treating the JVM as a kind of convergence platform for these languages. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each language for different parts of our system.

For example: JRuby makes available a bunch of great libraries and frameworks for doing frontend web development, like Rails and Padrino. Scala is ideal for writing performance-sensitive components that need the safety and expressiveness of the language's advanced type system. Clojure lets us rapidly prototype in a more dynamic language while still offering the benefits of functional programming.

Our frontend developers are using MooTools, on the JavaScript side.

We're currently experimenting with Postgres 9 and Riak for data storage.

Of course, Harry Heymann and crew fixed the scaling issues, but for the reasons Ted mentioned above, it still makes sense to limit.

There were things I wanted to make, no one else was going to make them, so I learned out of one of those ""Learn ASP in 30 days!"" books (ps:  original version of dodgeball was ASP pulling from MS Access).

At ITP / NYU, my buddy Shawn Van Every started teaching me PHP / MySQL and I eventually learned PHP by re-writing / resurrecting dodgeball. 

I'm a pretty lousy coder - I actually only know scripting languages (I've never had luck w/ C / Java / etc) - but I know enough to hack together prototypes which is often all you need to get started and get from 0 -> 10k users etc.
  "
Dennis-Crowley-1,"Joe LaPenna is a great guy who built foursquare's first Android app using the foursquare API.  His worked jumpstarted foursquare's presence on non-iPhone devices and played a big part in kicking off our developer ecosystem.

When we first built foursquare, we wanted to get it in everyone's hands but, with only two people, didn't have the manpower to build it for all platforms. We worked super hard to get the iPhone app out, and then, to make it easier to build on other platforms, we opened up the API. Joe LaPenna, who is an incredibly talented coder (he works at Google), built the first Android app using that API. We've seen a bunch of other awesome builds, like the work Geoff Gauchet did for WebOS. It's obviously both amazing and humbling to see that people like what you're doing enough to contribute to it in that way.

As foursquare grew up a bit (and Android adoption exploded), we decided we could move a lot faster by bringing development in house. It's been that way for well over a year now - development is led by our own awesome Mark Wyszomierski. Because of the way the Android market is structured, we can't rename the package, so it still carries the name of the awesome Joe (and the open-source name 'foursquared'). An exciting piece of foursquare trivia for you  :)

Dennis-Crowley-1,"We sold because we couldn't find anyone (angels, VCs) willing to invest in what we were doing.  Admittedly we were super green - two kids that came out a strange art/tech program at NYU, not b-school hustlers that knew the ins/out of fundraising.

We randomly met the Google folks while we were out trying to raise funding for dodgeball.  Their pitch was ""We don't invest in companies, but you guys should come here and work on this stuff at Google.""  Sounded great to two guys living off credit cards and NYU pizza.

So it wasn't our goal to sell... it was our goal to try to find a way to continue building out the dodgeball product / building out the vision.  When we didn't have luck with investors, the idea of bringing dodgeball to Google was our best shot at getting to continue to work on bringing our ideas to the world... which we did (even tho the dodgeball story didn't end up the quite the way we wanted it to)

(also worth noting that we didn't even consider that dodgeball could turn into our ""job"" until right around grad school graduation... after write-ups in the NYTimes and Newsweek, etc. our thinking was, ""wait, why are we out interviewing for design gigs... if we play our cards right, *this* could be our job"" ... and that's what got us going down the fundraising / entrepreneurial road)
  "
Dennis-Crowley-1,"Foursquare didn't create the market, dodgeball did back in 2004.  Google's acquisition of dodgeball in 2005 threw some legitimacy behind the space and spawned competitors like Loopt, Whrrl, Brightkite, etc.

Up thru 2009, I feel the check-in space was still pretty stale - everyone doing what everyone else was doing.  Then foursquare launched at SXSW 2009 with an heavy emphasis on the *incentive* behind checking-in - points, badges, mayorships, leaderboard, social competition and trickling-out cityguide-style discovery via tips and to-dos.  Once foursquare starting picking up traction, you startled seeing the existing players starting to be inspired by foursquare's features - Loopt & Brightkite added different forms of badges, Yelp added ""Dukes"", Whrrl added ""Societies"". Gowalla (which also launched at SXSW 2009) deserves credit for also focusing on incentives for checking-in around the same time, though they were originally focused on collecting items and passport stamps before later introducing more social elements such as being able to see where your friends were at & the ability to leave tips (""notes"") behind for other users.

So, I think dodgeball had the first mover advantage back in 2005...  which gave us (er, I used to work at dodgeball) the insight & experience needed to create a product (er, foursquare) that would re-define the space in 2009. I think the reason we're still #1 (and now competing w/ the likes of Facebook & Google) is because we continue to keep inventing what the future mobile + location + social is supposed to look like.
  "
Dennis-Crowley-1,"Early days:  ""Let's build things that make cities easier to use""

Today:  ""Let's build things that make the real world easier to use"" 

We've recently been starting to talk about foursquare being about Discovery, Encouragement and Loyalty.  ""Discovery"" being all the tools that help people find their friends, new places, new experiences.  ""Encouragement"" being what we're doing with weaving game mechanics in with checkins and recommendations, the little things - points, badges, mayorships - that can push you towards experiencing new things.  ""Loyalty"" being everything we're doing with connecting local merchants with their customers (merchant platform, venue dashboards, etc).

The future is about building out foursquare as a platform for everyone to use.  Places APIs shouldn't just be defined by distance, they should be defined by distance, context, the social graph, the history of venue checkins, popularity, trending, etc.  All this stuff is baked into the way we think about the world and hopefully will allow people to build new types of apps using our APIs.

Jan 09:  Me & Naveen start working on 4SQ seriously
Mar 09:  Launch at SXSW, 4000 (?) users
Apr 09:  First mtgs w/ USV, OATV, a few other investors
May 09: ...still trying to raise money  (""how is this different than dodgeball?"")
Jun 09:  ... still trying to raise money (""show us some more traction"")
Jul 09: ... We start seeing merchants start <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sup..."">using foursquare to interact with customers</a> (Marsh Cafe, SF).  Charlie O'Donnell writes a blog post called ""<a href=""http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.co..."">This is gonna be big</a>"".   Fred Wilson follows up with a post agreeing and then a lot of people started paying attention to what we were doing.

So, anyway I have a few answers to this question:

#1.  I had a moment when me + Alex were working on dodgeball and I was able to query out places my friends had been but I hadn't been to yet...  where I was like ""holy shit, this could prob tell me where to go"".  So we always knew what direction this stuff should be going.

#2.  We struggled for almost 6 months before we knew foursquare was going to be our ride to make ""it"" happen.

#3.  And it took the Marsh Cafe in SF (and Charlie's post) to show us what we were going to need to do to make it all happen (connecting merchants with customers).  This is a classic Clay Shirky social software rules, but the stuff you're building doesn't really start to take off until your users start using it in ways the designers never originally anticipated.  The Marsh Cafe was our first big unanticipated use case and we just ran with it.

I mean, you can always go back to school if the startup doesn't work out right?  (just as you can always go back to grad school if your career doesn't work out... which is exactly what I did when the dot-com bubble blew up in 2001 when I was 3 years out of school)

  "
Dennis-Crowley-1,"1.  Hustle to get something built.  (we started in January and flipped the switch on 4SQ the Thursday before SXSW.  Me & Naveen were both coding in the airport, on the tarmac, on the runway :)

2.  Start telling friends and stranger to try out your app.  (you can do this via word-of-mouth, stickers, flyers, etc).  FYI - We spent $0 on marketing and only did word-of-mouth.

Bonus Tips:

3.  Get on the Twitter, search for what people are saying about your app and reply to them.  Try to answer as many support + feature requests tweets you can.  Get people to spread the love.

4.  Set up a forum for users to help themselves w/ tech problems (e.g. GetSatisfaction).  If all goes well, a community of superusers will emerge that are willing to help people get on board.

5.  Try to have someone back home (aka not distracted by SXSW) watching over things - the servers, the load, the community, etc.  It'll help while you're doing your thing in Austin.

This means that you know exactly how much you make and how much it costs to serve a custom or sell a product.

Saul-Klein,"trying to undercover some of the gems in the Israeli community, but more generally believe that design is an under appreciated art in successful businesses - see http://qr.ae/8qsd
  "
Saul-Klein,"My view is the Platonic startup has a founding team of a developer, a designer and a distributor.
 
The perfect startup has all three founders:
someone who understands how to build technologies and systems to solve problems;
someone who understands the human factors behind those problems, why they exist, what it takes to fix them and how to shape the experience;
someone who understands how to reach, talk to and sell to the people whose problems are being solved - and keep finding more of them

The ideal startup has two of the three founders, but all three skills are present between them.

Very few people have all three skills, and even if they come close, they are rarely in perfect balance. In modern business Steve Jobs is probably the only person who even comes close, which arguably took him 25+ years.

I have come to believe during my time as an operator, entrepreneur and investor that the balance of these skills is so important to the long-term health of a business that if balance is not achieved early then the impact later can be profound - sometimes terminal. You can argue that the DNA created by Microsoft's over emphasis on distribution (Steve) and development (Bill), has ultimately cost it $50bn or more in lost revenue, market share and market capitalization. There are many more examples.

Developers have worn the crown for the last 30 or more years in the technology industry - rightly. They are indispensable and the foundation for success. It is right that Google and Facebook pride themselves on being engineering organizations (note - so did Microsoft).

But in the world following Jonathan Ive, designers are finally getting their due. It is interesting to see the emphasis that both Twitter and Quora have put on product design, not just engineering. It is also true that open source and the commoditization of many technologies has put much more emphasis on experience.

But although Sean Ellis, Dave McClure and others are trying to put this right, of the three disciplines, the distributor is still the least appreciated skill.

Many of these differences are ingrained - some mentally, but mostly from our education systems which stream students early and don't actively encourage the mixing of hard science, arts and commerce.

Smart teams understand quickly that all three skills are essential - if you can't recognize the need, you won't be able to hire for it or value it. So however big you become, you're always storing up trouble for the more balanced insurgents.

Its neat to see people currently answering and answers popup.  I think its that ""live"" feel and that makes it fun.  I also like the quick functionality of Quora where you can easily follow people and interests expanding your knowledge base.  Being able to shoot out messages to invite friends on Twitter and Facebook is huge, too.  Awesome collaboration setup.  You feel a bit like you're in a live discussion.

Linkedin is good, a little stale and sanitized.  It lacks much of what I wrote before.  Many times there are snide commenters cruising it who want to attack the questioner and derail the conversation.  The answers can sometimes take so long to come in - by the time you get them, you have moved on.

Like the stories you hear out of Microsoft and Google of team infighting and competing projects getting stopped like the Kin Phone.  So many companies just get too large and the bureaucracy kills innovation.  Google Wave biggest problem was that non of your friends could get on it so you couldnt use it much and invites were limited.  Buzz is a great product but having it hidden on your email and not on an open website somewhere like Twitter.com made it limited and confusing. 

I would agree on Dynamic Leadership too.  Mark Zuckerberg seems to be an innovative exciting guy.  Same with Steve Jobs.  I think they really champion and lead inspiring innovation within their companies.  ""Lead by example.""  Eric Schmidt I'm sure is a nice guy but I wanna fall asleep when try watching him.  I think you need that energy to inspire your troops.

Chris-Voss,"I say yes.  I think Scoble or someone blogged on a vision of taking your iPad with you as your core computer to keyboard/docking stations at work and home.  I think more and more the finger use will become more intuitive and 2nd nature.  Programs will build on it to replace the keyboard.  Its rumored the new iPad 2 has multiple finger control options with it and as new generations grow up ""touching"" as opposed to ever having used a physical keyboard it will seem odd to them to try to use one.  Look at all the babies you see growing up on the iPad.  Like writing, typing may go out - maybe all you will do in the future is do audio text recognition.

There are several other terms of a deal that must be understood from your example to know if the angel investor would feel that the financial result of a company selling for less than $100 million is good.

1) Is there an automatic conversion to equity upon change in control?  i.e. when the company sells, does the debt convert and at what (pre-negotiated) valuation would it convert? (NOTE: this can be different than the valuation cap, but in practice might be the same)

2) Is there a valuation cap specified in the deal and does the investor suspect that a subsequent equity financing occur before the sale which converts the debt into equity?  Valuation Caps generally have the simplicity of equity financings without the hassle and expense of the same volume of paperwork.

David-King,"I think the best way to build an extremely strong company culture is for the founders of a company to actually embody or personally strive for many of the values which the company aspires to have.

I would posit that great organizations know something about their culture before they usually know about their product or business.

I think it is actually a great first step when building a company to explicitly discuss and layout with your founding and early team what you are working on and what principles you wish the organization to embody.

Once an organization gets wrapped up in the day to day of operating and searching for a product or business it is quite challenging to reset expectations about why everyone is there and to take enough time to think about the type of organization you're crafting.

Some organizations learn and mature over time, but many of the best organizations are culturally extensions of their founders personalities and being more explicit about this earlier is helpful.

I agree with Jack Lion Heart that much of the perception of clique-like behavior might be the answer distribution and user distribution mechanisms.  Also, many of the topics that are so-far over-represented on Quora have very strong personalities associated with them so there can be some cult-of-personality behavior.

Quora is one of the first products that lets us see so much about what the future of the Internet will look like.  The presence of identity in information retrieval will have a profound effect on the creation, curation, and organization of this information.

I was in the first round of Uber because when I saw just one taxi on Travis' iPhone and his passion it was clear to me that he would scale it to thousands.... of course, I would be lying if I said I saw it getting to where it is today (much more than thousands) as quickly as it has.

Yoga and $4 coffee are examples of crazy trends from the 80s that have become something almost everyone has either tried or participates in. In 1987 the idea of spending $3 on a .25-.50 cup of joe was insane.



The idea of bankers and lawyers doing yoga in 1986? Also absurd... but now it's not uncommon to see 15 to 70 years olds in the same yoga class! It's 100% normal.

Meditation? Seems strange to some, until they do it and have a massive, life changing event. Which it has been for me and countless others.

If you want to know if this will work, get the 1.0 of the App and spend $10 for the yearly pass. Do it 10 days in a row before you go to bed.

If you don't feel you got your money's worth I will hand you a $10 bill.

note: there is still a 70% chance that a startup like Calm.com will fail... that's just math/historical trends. Of course, I think it has a 70% chance of being a $100m+ business that will get my investors 10-25x their investment.

  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"You should talk directly with the owner of the businesss if you have this much leverage, and you should center your ""package"" around getting close to that individul.

As a developer you will have a ton of options--that's not what is important in startup life. Being as close to the founder, the investors, the board and the decision making process is the place you want to be.

So, if it was me I'd say:

1.  In terms of pay I'd like to have whatever the difference is between the top developer on the team and the CEO -- even if it is lower. (i.e. CEO takes $100k, top developer gets $130k you take $115k).

2. That you get a stock package that is 2x the current best developer OR what the stock package would have been if you joined in the A round (i.e. time machine). You can say ""if i suck you fire me and I lose it all due to the 1 year cliff).

3. Most important: I will only take the job if I get to have a 1-on-1 lunch with the founder 2x a year and we put it on the schedle now--because I want to learn and understand the business deeply.

This puts you in the ""massive team player"" and ""close to the crown"" categories... which is really where you want to be.

4. Finally, max cash is bullshit in our industry. There is always more money somewhere, and after $1XXk you're life isn't much difference (the beach in fiji, maui and mexico is the exact same... just 10x the price difference). So, optimize for the BEST TEAM and BEST PRODUCT and BEST MISSION. That will give you the most joy and happiness.

5. Loyalty: be a loyal melon farmer always... too many people get caught up in cash and the shinny new objects. like relationships, the best ones are built through the tought times. Stick with a great leader and team for 2-5 years.... because all the good stuff is in year 3, 4 and 5 of a project. Years one and two are just slogging generally.

good luck, and if you need more advice or want to come work at my startup ping me jason AT inside DOT com. :-p

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"Matt and I talked about this when I invested in Circa, and after the launch of Inside. We are cool.

At that time I invested my LAUNCH Ticker [ LAUNCH ] had been publishing for months. The ticker is similar to Circa, as both are curating. Ticker was publishing for months before Circa. Of course Matt was working on the idea for Circa long before I launched the LAUNCH Ticker (he told me, I believe that).

We decided the ticker was not competitive. We had not talked about Inside, because we were keeping it stealth.

Now, Inside is obviously MUCH more broad that the ticker and overlaps with Circa in that we are both 'mobile' and 'news,' however Circa is journalism and we are not.

Inside is never going to do journalism, we are sticking to curation.

This means we will be (and have been) linking to Circa's awesome journalism.

One way to look at the two product is Circa is a better New York Times and we are a better Google News.

In another 10 years I think folks will look at see these apps as cable channels and magazines, at which time it will be very obvious that consumers want to use at least a half dozen of them.

I'm a huge supporter and love Circa. I predict both teams will do great work and push this space forward.

I'm guessing Matt Galligan may want to check in here as well.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"That's a very granular question indeed!

There is no specific devices other than a standard stock plan at work. Mahalo went sideways for two years so while it might not be the ground, ground, ground floor, but the cap table makes it still a relatively ""new"" startup. Also, you can increase the # of options a person has to make up for things like the amount of capital raised and the valuation (obviously).

Also, a lot of folks from the mahalo era didn't execute their options (intelligently in a way since it wasn't looking very good their for a bit -- especially after Matt Cutts and Google decided we didn't deserve to exist and took all our traffic ), so there was a large % of the option pool still available.

I think Research you spot in beta - Inside.com has a great chance of a being a big win, but you know how the start business is--hard!

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I don't see any collusion as an angel on, and one of the top five members of, AngelList.

I've never seen any collusion in four years of doing this / 40 + investments and the formation of a $10m angel fund (the Launch Conference fund).

Of course, I put $50-250k into startups and I typically don't lead the round (yet!) and set the terms. That being said, great founders with great startups in a hot market like this are setting the terms.

It's a game of chicken, and I watched top firms not be willing to pay for Twitter, @facebook and @uber at A and B rounds that now look cheap. As a founder if you are setting the terms and you can't get them you'll know quickly, as folks will say ""whoa... a $15m cap on a 10 week old @ycombinator company seems a little high no?""

Then the market corrects a little. The best thing to do is to talk to a LOT of folks and get a marketplace going for your startup... then pick highest quality partner at the highest quality firm, as well as the most helpful angels with the best reputations (angel list is the best place to start checking this fyi... their recommendations feature is KILLER and verified).

Collusion to me is something folks think is going on much more than it actually is.... who has time to collude over something like a couple of million bucks on the valuation of a potential unicorn or otherwise promising startup?

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I have four rules for folks presenting at the LAUNCH Festival ( Page on Festival ).
1. show the product in under 15 seconds.
2. show your products features -- don't tell me about them
3. examples matter: so come up with real-world examples of your product at it's peak effectiveness
4. synchronicity: the presenter/what's on screen should match perfectly with what you're saying at all times.
  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"1. Twitter has been an amazing tool for this, as I can quickly favorite someone's tweet and send them a little social props.

2. I have a mailchimp list (Page on Jasonnation or LAUNCH ) where I send my email newsletter, invites to my events, etc. I send this from my *personal* email address. Freqeuntly I will get high-profile folks to write me back to call BS or shower me with praise on the editorials. This is massively efficient: i reach 30k+ folks and get back 500-2k responses per email.

3. AngelList is powerful for me seeing what my close peeps are up to.

4. This Week in Startups, my podcast, is an amazing way for me to have 100+ folks on the show a year and build significant bonds with them. Talking about your business for an hour really let's me know who you are.

Outside of this, I use email, and I don't waste too much time trying maximize my network. Creating high-quality content consistently lets me reach a large number of folks....

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"Mahalo.com and Inside are the same company. Mahalo has been sunset (not investing in it, but it still makes some nice coin) and 100% of our focus is on Inside App.

Inside is in private alpha right now and will start private beta later this month. It's the greatest product i've ever built, and I predict it will be the largest content site in the world, eventually beating Wikipedia (10 years from now).

It takes everything we learned in human curation from Mahalo, as well as the passion from Weblogs Inc. (i,.e. Engadget, Autoblog, etc)  and combines it with other projects I've done into what will be the most important news platform ever created. yes, more important than the nytimes and CNN, but without competing with them.

On that note, the SEO business is dead.... Google is taking the second and third click from everyone. I tried for a year to rebound from the Google Panda update, talking to Matt Cutts personally, as well as the most senior folks at Google. They gave me the runaround and I gave up.

Matt Cutts treated me like a dog after 10 years as a partner. I'll never do business with him again. Any content business that partners with Google is really risking their lives.... they don't care about anything but their own growth. They are going to kill or dominate all content companies that partner with them.

After 10 years as a google partners, having generated over $20m in adsense revenue, I basically realized Google is no longer interested in being a partner to content creators. Google wants to dominate content partners and replace them.

If you are in the content business Google is the enemy sadly. They are category by category killing content companies: comparison search, flight/travel data, sports data, general reference (wikipedia, mahalo, ehow) and of course all video.

of course, we couldn't actually move $ around due to the Crowdfunding laws not being ready. Now that the Securities Exchange Commision has released more guidance around crowdfunding I think things will get even more interesting.
  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"Very.

My angel fund, the LAUNCH Fund, is planning to invest in 50-100 startups over the next five years.

Our average size investment will be $50-250k.

I now have $300k+ in syndicates. I predict it will eventually reach $500-1m per deal.

Next month I will invest $200k in a startup I love and my syndicates will join me for $300k.

We will be the lead investor in this round.

Previously I was < 10% of any given investment round--typically 5% of the round. Now I'm going to be between 33--100% of the round.

That's a huge difference.

I can now get founders fully funded and off to the races and I don't need to ask anyone for help. I don't have to ask anyone for permission.

VCs take weeks to get their partners to agree on a deal. I take a hours to a couple of days to decide.

So, this changes everything. The bottom half of VCs--the ones who don't really provide a lot of extra value--are going to find themselves never getting to the best deals.

It won't impact Sequoia Capital (VC Firm), Benchmark, Accel Partners or other top tier firms--as they provide massive value.

Frankly, my game gets better as the stakes get higher because i'm not board like i am at a $100-500 game. I see this a lot with folks, so i generally like to play with billionaires at $10k buy in games. :-)

I never play above my stakes, i never drink and play and i made it to #1,000 out of 6,700 at the WSOP main event.

To be a *great* player you need to do it full-time i've learned. it's really about getting into a certain zone over 30-50+ hours a week. i only have 10-20 hours a month to put into my game.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I've heard that a bunch of times. I didn't start these things to create an incubator, I started them because they were personally interesting to me... my passion is startups, media, technology and entrepreneurship. That being said the two big winners are:

a) This Week in Startups: 300 episodes, $500k a year in revenue next year, great guests, great fans, 100k+ downloads.

b) LAUNCH Festival: millions raised at the event, five years already, amazing alumni from Mint to fitbit to yammer to spacemonkey and more.

right now i'm so busy with Mahalo (soon to be Inside.com), that I've ""contained"" the scope of the two ""side projects"" to one yearly event and twice a week for the show.

Maybe after Inside.com I'll do an incubator or some sort, but I like to build so if i did that it would have to be more like Science or Bill Gross and Idealab.

Thanks for asking!

PS - This year I set two challenges for myself with LAUNCH (March 4-6th 2013):

1. have the startups raise $10M+ from angels and crowdfunding (if legal at the time). More here: I Wonder If Live Crowdfunding Works? Let's Find Out! - LAUNCH -

2. Have the largest event ever filled with people who make stuff. 2,000 seats in the theater and 5,000 tickets to the event issued. How? I'm giving away scholarships to developers, UX and designers here: Free Ticket to the LAUNCH Festival - LAUNCH -

almost 1k signed up in the first day... and we're checking them... they're actually real developers, designers, etc.

  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I've played the Main Event three times and came in the top 50% the first two times (day two), and in the top 15% the last time (day three).

1. There is a wide range of players in day one. Complete donks and pros and everything inbetween.

2. You start with 30,000 chips and 50-100 blinds. So you have 300 big blinds. The levels are two hours long. Most tournaments are 30-60 minute levels and 10k chips. That means there is no reason to be going all in during day one. You have to be selective.

3. Day two you have half the field gone, which means that your table composure goes from 1/3rd pros to 2/3rds+ pros. What table you get on day two matters, both in terms of who and how many chips they have. You might wind up at a table with multiple people with 150-250k chips, or just one--or none. You might have seven pros or three.

4. Day two you have to really start keeping up because there are antes and the levels are fast.

5. It is grueling. You play five, two hour levels a day. That's 10 hours of poker starting at noon and ending at 1AM+. You have a couple of breaks and dinner for 90 minutes.

6. It's a pool of bacteria and foul bathrooms. I have a secret VIP bathroom I use, and I wash my hands constantly. Even with that you will get sick after the event or during it. HAve a ZPack ready.
 
Overall it's a blast, people play very tight and you play very few hands. People are laying down sets on the flop, or Kings or Queens pre-flop all the time.
  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"Couple of points here:

1. The network effects of markets will mean there will be only two viable players in this space.

2. One will be AngelList--hands down. No one will take that slot from them, and their valuation is already significant according to sources.

3. That leaves one other slot. That slot would instantly be filled by KickStarter if they want to take it. They told me they won't do it--but I don't believe them. This is an easy thing to add and their users will demand it.

4. I don't have inside information, but it's a lock that SecondMarket--the best run secondary market in the world--will dip down to this level for the feeder effect of it.

5. If you can buy shares in those three startups I would do it (I am about to close on shares in one of them). All three will be multibillion dollar businesses in five years.

6. I've never heard of Gust.com or received a deal from it. I'm the #3 user on AngelList.

7. This is a really dumb comment: ""once a company goes down the crowdfunding path, they will effectively be cutting themselves off from any future funding by deeper-pocketed Accredited Investors."" Any company with hyper growth, a great team, a great market or some combination of those three will INSTANTLY get funded on AngelList.

8. There isn't going to be any money to be made in crowdfunding. A 5% take isn't enough to really cover all the expenses around this. As such, I think folks like AngelList who don't care about making money--but rather creating impact--will take this space over. AngelList doesn't charge anything right now and they only care about quality. I know Naval, he's a driven, principled guy who is not in it for the money. He's going to disrupt the space and build a next-gen LinkedIn.

For me the name of the game is to GET THE PUBLICS money to create great products. That's how I'm thinking. The marketplaces are already set... no one will get past SecondMarket, Kickstarter and AngelList. It's already over.

Of course, shortly after we launched Bing and Google launched what I called ""comprehensive human-powered search."" The concept being that humans would groom not just 10 links, but facts and questions around a search term.

I think this was somewhat innovative, but in truth many of my ideas came from DAUM.net and naver in Korea. I just got them to America before everyone else.

I think the work we're doing in iPad apps will be a bigger win than the search product which got us to the 140th largest site on the internet, millions a year in revenue and 15m uniques in a month (ahh... the pre-Panda days of SEO when you could invest in content on the web and get traffic consistently from Google).

Doug-Bowman,"Like Marco, I'm also partially biased. This was my second time speaking at (and obviously, attending) Webstock. The organizers (Mike, Tash, Ben, Deb) have always pulled together an impressive mix of speakers that transcends the typical web or tech conference lineup. There's something about the type of speakers they pull in, the topics they cover, the way the organizers treat both speakers and attendees, and the beautiful venue itself that all work together to form one of the best conferences I've ever attended.

I can't speak for my own talk, but other speakers this year were inspiring and captivating. I loved hearing Scott McCloud, Gruber, Marco, Lopp, Josh Clark, and Peter Sunde (among others). Amanda Palmer was fantastic, as expected. And presentations from Tom Coates and David McCandless were effin mesmerizing and beautiful eye candy. Merlin Mann closed it out the week with a brutally honest and transparent set of revelations about how we all have fears, including the speakers, but none of those fears should ever prevent us from doing awesome things. Awesome lineup this year. As a speaker, you don't always feel up for sticking around for sessions that aren't your own, especially if you're still anxiously preparing before your talk. But at Webstock, I wanted to see every session on the program. This year's conference was no exception.

Mike says that since they (as organizers) are so remote, and have never really attended other web conferences, they aren't quite aware of the setup and rhythm typical of other events. So despite their lack of awareness (or maybe because of it) they go above and beyond other organizers, and manage to create something unique and truly enjoyable each year.

IMO, New Zealand is the most beautiful country in the world, and should be high on anyone's list of places to visit. This, plus the fact that New Zealand is a good distance removed from the rest of the world (other than Australia) plays into the draw of both visiting the country and attending or speaking at Webstock. Combine this with Wellington's amazing Town Hall as a venue with some of the best acoustics in the world (where The Beatles and The Stones have played) and round-table seating where attendees actually get to know each other, and you get a rare event where everyone comes away truly appreciative that they got to take part in it.
