Robert-Scoble-1,"Update. It's now almost a year since I got mine and I find my utility going down because Google has not yet fixed the major problems.

Voice response only works if you have a connection. Often I'm in a place, like Yellowstone, that has no connectivity.
You can only put 10 contacts into Glass, so making calls much more difficult than it should be.
You can't see, edit, or caption photos in Glass easily (only voice commands, which don't work in noisy situations like concerts). No way to automatically push photos from Glass to your smartphone, which would make it a LOT easier to edit, etc.
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter apps inadequate for really doing great posts.
No store, so getting apps very difficult.
Voice control of directions is usually good, but when it makes an error it is very hard to fix.
No live video streaming yet.
Battery life continues being too short, particularly when shooting video (I only get about 40 minutes when recording video).
Video compression is being done in software, not hardware, so unit gets hot, video isn't very high quality, and battery dies in 45 minutes or less.
Video only goes to a special part of Google+ (a new version of YouTube) and you can't easily push it to other places, like Vimeo, or your existing YouTube account.
The price is still at least twice as expensive as the most expensive smartphone and doesn't work without a smartphone. Until the price comes down I'll advise most people to stay away, especially given the lack of utility at the moment (and the risks that the UI and API's will dramatically shift this year).

There are other problems, as well, that keep it from being very useful. When I wrote the post below I thought Google would fix the problems quickly. I keep hoping fixes are coming.

I have had a Google Glass for two weeks now and they are VERY useful. Here's my review: My two-week review of Google Glass: it all depends on the?

Why? Well, just yesterday I was walking my kids around in a stroller. Both hands were on the stroller. Yet I was able to have New York Times articles read to me, I took a phone call (and made one to my wife), and I took a photo of the experience too.

This product is life changing. By the way, the Glass can NOT broadcast live to the world yet. You can shoot a video, have it uploaded to a private area on Google+, and only then can you move it over to public view from your smartphone or from inside the Glass itself.

After showing them to hundreds of people, I think the threats are mostly perception issues: if you walk into the wrong kind of bar, or a bathroom or gym locker room with them on, you might suffer consequences that won't be fun.

The big usefulness, though, is that these assist you living your life. When I got to the airport the other day it told me the gate and time of my flight. Very useful. Google Now also tells me other stuff, like how bad the traffic is on the way to work, etc. That's where the real functionality is.

Robert-Scoble-1,"Easy. Walk into any restaurant. Look at how many people are holding a mobile phone. Now consider that about a billion people are getting smartphones this year alone. Second, look at adoption rates of new things on laptops vs. mobile. Mobile is way higher. Third, look at numbers at some place like Facebook -- mobile is passing desktop usage.

I often sit next to people who use Windows PCs and I ask them ""show me something you've put on your computer that's new, loaded in the past couple of weeks."" Out of hundreds of people most can't answer that. Ask a mobile user the same thing and they'll take you on a tour of their apps ""oh, just got this Dots game, or check out the new Nest app I just got, etc etc.""

The tech press and investors care about where the market is going. Where is growth happening. Where are the most interesting, new, apps?

In my world: mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile.
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I get way more requests than I can take. Here's a few things I do:

1. I have an out-of-office message on Gmail that gives me the permission not to answer you (no answer is an ""automatic no"" the email says). Here's that email -- that lets me avoid being a jerk just by not replying:

++++++++++++++

Thank you for taking the time to write to me and I'm sorry if I don't get back to you.

I'm now getting emails at a level that I can't respond to everyone. This is an automatic response to an email you sent to scobleizer@gmail.com.

I will make a best attempt to get back to you, especially if you are sharing world-changing technology or if you are building contextual software or services, since I wrote a book with Shel Israel on that trend. Our book, ""Age of Context,"" has been released at Age of Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy eBook: Robert Scoble, Shel Israel: Kindle Store

I also am looking for best-of-breed tools to help people build companies on top of cloud infrastructure, due to my role at Rackspace.

I do read every email, but I only can reply to about 5%, sorry.

Unfortunately if I don't answer you within two or three days, it's the same as hearing ""no.""

To PR people, if you want me to cover your product you've got to give me more than one day warning.  I don't do press-release rewrites like other tech bloggers. It's best to get in touch with me at LEAST A MONTH before you launch.

If you are looking for more about where I'm publishing, or just want to have an informal chat, visit Robert Scoble | Facebook which has links to all of my blogs, and social media accounts.

Another way to get through is to talk with my producer, Rocky Barbanica. You can reach him at rocky@rackspace.com.

Thanks and sorry if I don't get back to you.

++++++++++++++

2. Have a philosophy. Mine is contextual computing is going to be more and more interesting. So, if you aren't contextual (mobile first) and using sensors, wearable computers, etc, then I will be less interested in you. This lets me say no in a nice way. ""Sorry, I'm looking for a specific kind of interaction in 2014 and you don't fit.""

3. Have a boss who makes you say no due to other interests. Boss's don't need to be employers, either. My kids and wife are in charge of my life too and demand my time the same as others do. ""My wife won't let me fit that speech into our calendar, sorry."" Or, ""my kids haven't seen me for a month so I can't make that dinner, sorry."" Works just as well as ""my boss at Rackspace already signed me up for another speech that evening, sorry.""

4. Know what you want out of life. I want to have more three-star Michelin-rated dinners. So, if you offer me one of those I'll find it very hard to turn down. I also want to see the next big company when it's just two entrepreneurs at a table. I find it hard to turn down a chance to see another company, particularly one that has an interesting new product coming out.

5. Try to be helpful in some other way. ""Hey, I can't do that interview you wanted me to do because I'm already booked this week, how about I introduce you to some other journalists who can help?""

6. Suggest ways to get to success. Those who are busy are very transactional. So, asking for coffee might get turned down, while asking to meet to pitch might not. Coffee implies some sort of squishy social agenda. ""I don't do coffee, but if you have a pitch please email me that."" Often they really just wanted to pitch you anyway and were trying to be nice by asking to buy you coffee.

7. If the person sounds interesting to at least meet, suggest meeting at an event ""hey, I'm about to head to CES in Vegas, will you be there or at SXSW in March?""

8. Be honestly busy. My calendar is 100% filled for January now. I'm very happy to show you my Google Calendar, which demonstrates that well. So, saying ""I'm booked until February and not booking new things"" works.

9. Ask them to go through someone who has an easier time saying no. For instance, I have a producer, Rocky Barbanica. He is far more willing to say no than I am. That said, if you convince him, it usually is because you actually have something great, so I'm more willing to put you on the calendar after you get through him.

10. Push them over to a social network. I do that because I want to be scalable in everything I do (answering a question on Quora, for instance, helps out potentially thousands of people, while answering a question in email only helps one person out). So, saying ""ask that question on Quora"" is a good way to turn down people. Smart people use Facebook to see when I'm online, too (I'll often chat with you there before answering my own email).

UPDATE: a friend, Loic Le Meur, turned down my request by saying simply ""I'll be on Necker Island then."" (That's the island that Richard Branson owns). I'll add that as #11: be doing something far cooler than what is being offered. :-)
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I would say that you should contact a tech journalist only AFTER you do this:

Know and follow at least 50 (I have a list of 600+ tech journalists on Twitter at Tech News People).
Make sure your startup might be interesting to the journalist in question.
Know why said tech journalist MIGHT cover you and HOW he/she might cover you (IE, have an interesting story). If I was trying to get into the New York Times, for instance, I'd read at least 500 articles written there first and I'd even start putting them into buckets. Know what bucket yours will go in.
Know how your startup is better than other companies already on the field.

Remember that, in my case, I only can accept about 1% of what gets pitched to me. I'm looking for companies who are pushing the future forward. That's vague, but not really. scobleizer@gmail.com is generally the best but phone can work too. +1-425-205-1921 -- know when I'm online and available, you can tell this from Facebook, in my case: https://www.facebook.com/RobertS...

Some tips?

Keep it short.
Explain why you are an example of how the future is changing.
Bring up anything that backs up your story (for instance, do you have a famous developer who already changed the world at, say, Apple?)
Make it easy to dive in. Do you have a blog? A video? A bunch of people talking about you on Twitter or Google+ or Facebook? A successful Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign?
Work hard on a great headline. Lots of us get 1,000 press releases a day. Think about how to stand out.
Get someone we trust to refer you. If Marc Andreessen emails me and says ""Scoble, you gotta see this new company"" you bet your bottom dollar I'll stop and pay attention.
ALWAYS carry your demo on your phone or iPad and be willing to show in weird places. Accidental PR is the best. I've found many of my favorite companies away from ""official PR.""
Be persistent, but not overbearing. Sometimes trying a second try when you have something new to announce works. I don't know why. It's just the luck of the draw. The difference between being persistent and being overbearing is a very thin line, though. Be good at listening to feedback.
If in a crowded market (photo sharing services, for instance) you better be 10x better and you better be able to demonstrate that in 30 seconds or less. Google was the 17th search engine but in just one search I was hooked and saw why it was better.

Some don'ts?

Don't mix social and business. If you want to just hang out with us and be our friend, that's OK, but don't try to ""buddy up"" just to get a chance to pitch me. Our social time is for socializing, not work.
Don't ask to pitch. The answer is ALWAYS no. Instead, ask something like ""I have a ground-breaking iPad app that is 10x better than Microsoft Office, what do you need to verify that what I'm telling you is true?""
Don't pitch us without looking at our Twitter and Facebook (even better if you use a tool like Nimble.com that shows you everything about us) . I have gotten a pitch right after I learned my mom was dying (I wrote about that online).
If you meet me in the street, don't try to pitch me unless you have some very unusual social proof (like if you are hanging out with Marc Andreessen and he verifies that what you are building is the best thing he's seen this year). I never remember these ""street"" pitches and they rarely are any good anyway. Instead, introduce yourself, and ask for our email so that you can pitch us professionally.
Don't pitch us on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Email is best for a whole lot of reasons (at least in my case). If you do pitch us there you'll get instructions to pitch us on email (mine is scobleizer@gmail.com ). I hate these social pitches because I can't easily search for them in the future and I often don't have time to answer everyone everywhere so focus on my email first.
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I always want to be on the bleeding edge, or, more accurately use tools that are ""best of breed."" For the past seven years that was Apple's iPhone which is, still, arguably the best mobile ecosystem out there. Apps still ship on iPhone first (generally) and when I look at tech passionate people most of them still have iPhones and iPads.

That said, things are switching. Read Paul Stamatiou, designer at Twitter, about his experiences with Android: Android is better I agree with all his points.

My view started shifting last year when I saw a new series of trends that, bundled up, bring us contextual computing (I'm writing a book on those trends with Shel Israel, titled ""Age of Context"" that will come later this year).

Most of the apps in this new field are on Android first because of Android's more open approach. A great example is Everything.me - Introducing the Dynamic Phone TM, which is my favorite app switcher. It can change nearly everything about the phone and hook into all your apps, even. Things that are impossible for developers to do on iOS.

These new contextual apps, including Google Now, got me to look at Android in a new light. No longer was it an uglier cousin of iOS but was bringing very real innovation to bear.

Then, when Google Glass came out, my mind totally switched. I was  one of the first in line at last year's Google IO conference to lay down $1,500 for my own Google Glass (I've been wearing them every day since April 16, 2013).

Google Glass is a real game changer. No other consumer electronics device knows where I'm aimed, where I'm looking, and has such a consistent access to my context through the sensors inside.

Of course it works better with Android (it runs Android 4.0.4 inside). So that pushed me to make the switch.

Later, Moto X showed me that there's yet again, more innovation coming on the Android side of the fence (you can't talk to your iPhone without touching it first), but on Moto X it just listens for you to say ""OK Google Now."" Since it is illegal to touch a phone while driving, both Glass and Moto X are big deals for me since I drive 1.5 hours every day to the Rackspace Studio in San Francisco and back.

That all said, I still have an iPad and am watching the Apple ecosystem closely. Most users won't follow me, there aren't enough advantages -- yet. But with Paul's note, and my observations, there is something happening on the Android side of the fence and I think it'll become more obvious next year that Android has taken the innovation crown away from Apple (and everyone else).
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"It's expensive because the ones that are being distributed now are prototypes that are being built one-by-one.

I expect that when they are released to the public next year they will be somewhere around $200 to $300. The build-of-materials is somewhere around $100, when you look at all the components. Of course that doesn't cover the millions of dollars spent in R&D and in acquiring people, like Thad Starner, to come and build them.

Some reasons they are so expensive (this isn't the first time a company has charged a lot for developer prototypes -- the Xbox prototypes were about the same price):

Supply and demand. They can only make a few hundred per week at this point. So, having a low price wouldn't make sense. When you have very little supply and a lot of demand, raising the price is perfectly reasonable.
Making sure that the best people get them first. If I were Google I'd want mostly developers to have them at this point so that there'd be some apps when they are released early in 2014. Developers see the value in building companies and products to target a new platform. Paying $1,500 to build something like Instagram won't seem significant in three years if the business is successful. Most other people won't see the value in paying $1,500 for an unproven new gadget.
PR reasons. If you spend $1,500 for a pre-release prototype you know what you are getting into. You'll likely give a lot of feedback to Google. You'll likely understand the limitations (there are MANY app holes right now, for instance) and forgive those. Regular people, if they got them at this point, wouldn't understand those limitations and would complain about them on Twitter and Facebook, etc.
Anyway, I think this is a short term problem. By May most people will be able to buy them and I can't see a reason that Google would charge more than $500 for them (and I can see many that they would want to make them very low cost, like $200).
  "
Evan-Williams,"Another reason it became standard to break an article up is because it increases the number of pageviews and, thus, ad impressions.
  "
Evan-Williams,"I can't think of one.

All the companies mentioned here either:

a) *Did* have significant revenues:
Netscape (the same company as Mosaic, btw) made $400M in revenue the first 9 months of 1997: http://sec.edgar-online.com/nets...
Geocities (This is a guess, but I bet that traffic made Yahoo! a boatload of money back when banner dollars were easy to get. Maybe not enough to justify the $3.5B acquisition price, but that wasn't the question. Anyone know?)
Shutterfly (see comment above)

b) Didn't really have a lot of users. (What's ""a lot"" anyway?)
4chan?

c) Got bought, ran out of funding due to dot-com crash, or sued out of existence before they tried in earnest to monetize. None of these are the same as ""failing"" to monetize.
Geocities (Even if not really in category A under Yahoo's regime, they are here.)
Almost everyone else mentioned

Possible exceptions (don't really know the story on either of these, but I doubt it):
JenniCam (was she a company?)
DejaNews (did they have any users?)
Ning (I think they were growing well for a while, not sure what happened exactly.)

Having a large number of users and the inability to monetize them is a non-existent problem. People talk about it all the time, but it doesn't really happen?at least it doesn't happen in today's world. I'm not even sure it ever did. Sure, there were Internet companies that went out of business because they were losing too much money, but I think usually they didn't *really* have a lot of users (just a lot of hype) or they had out of control costs.

I was in the first round of Uber because when I saw just one taxi on Travis' iPhone and his passion it was clear to me that he would scale it to thousands.... of course, I would be lying if I said I saw it getting to where it is today (much more than thousands) as quickly as it has.

Yoga and $4 coffee are examples of crazy trends from the 80s that have become something almost everyone has either tried or participates in. In 1987 the idea of spending $3 on a .25-.50 cup of joe was insane.



The idea of bankers and lawyers doing yoga in 1986? Also absurd... but now it's not uncommon to see 15 to 70 years olds in the same yoga class! It's 100% normal.

Meditation? Seems strange to some, until they do it and have a massive, life changing event. Which it has been for me and countless others.

If you want to know if this will work, get the 1.0 of the App and spend $10 for the yearly pass. Do it 10 days in a row before you go to bed.

If you don't feel you got your money's worth I will hand you a $10 bill.

note: there is still a 70% chance that a startup like Calm.com will fail... that's just math/historical trends. Of course, I think it has a 70% chance of being a $100m+ business that will get my investors 10-25x their investment.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"You should talk directly with the owner of the businesss if you have this much leverage, and you should center your ""package"" around getting close to that individul.

As a developer you will have a ton of options--that's not what is important in startup life. Being as close to the founder, the investors, the board and the decision making process is the place you want to be.

So, if it was me I'd say:

1.  In terms of pay I'd like to have whatever the difference is between the top developer on the team and the CEO -- even if it is lower. (i.e. CEO takes $100k, top developer gets $130k you take $115k).

2. That you get a stock package that is 2x the current best developer OR what the stock package would have been if you joined in the A round (i.e. time machine). You can say ""if i suck you fire me and I lose it all due to the 1 year cliff).

3. Most important: I will only take the job if I get to have a 1-on-1 lunch with the founder 2x a year and we put it on the schedle now--because I want to learn and understand the business deeply.

This puts you in the ""massive team player"" and ""close to the crown"" categories... which is really where you want to be.

4. Finally, max cash is bullshit in our industry. There is always more money somewhere, and after $1XXk you're life isn't much difference (the beach in fiji, maui and mexico is the exact same... just 10x the price difference). So, optimize for the BEST TEAM and BEST PRODUCT and BEST MISSION. That will give you the most joy and happiness.

5. Loyalty: be a loyal melon farmer always... too many people get caught up in cash and the shinny new objects. like relationships, the best ones are built through the tought times. Stick with a great leader and team for 2-5 years.... because all the good stuff is in year 3, 4 and 5 of a project. Years one and two are just slogging generally.

Dave-McClure,"as jeff notes, typical fund investors tend to be institutional, corporate, or family office groups (collections of rich people), as well as high net worth folks (individual rich people).

some of the more successful & well-known micro-VC funds raise from the same sources as larger VC funds, however since most of us haven't been around very long (<5 years) and start out with smaller funds (<$50M), it's difficult to raise money from traditional VC investors because of our limited track record, and because they can't / don't write checks smaller than $5-10M. they may also have max ownership restrictions where they can't be more than 10-20% of the capital in any one fund.

in any case, 500 Startups first fund started out with a mix of individuals (lots of friends we knew from PayPal, Google, Facebook, YouTube, Linkedin, Twitter, etc), corporate investors, and some VC funds / individual partners. gradually as we have gotten more established & raised larger funds, we have begun aiming for larger investors from more traditional sources.

however, we still have a large # of small investors who helped us get started early, and we appreciate them a hell of a lot. in particular, some high-profile VCs & entrepreneurs were kind enough to write us small checks in the beginning, which helped us a LOT to get off the ground & legitimize us to other investors.
  "
Dave-McClure,"aS
  "
Dave-McClure,"all these answers are nonsense & mathematically flawed. it has absolutely nothing to do with returns.

the reason is because they want to hold board seats in the company, and have controlling stakes in governance.

there is *NO* good logic behind VCs taking 20% of individual companies in order to generate returns. they could take a lower % of more co's, or a higher % of fewer co's, and still achieve target returns (altho note that most do not).

more likely, the 20% ownership target is  practical for traditional VCs that aim to hold board seats -- given most companies only have 3-5 board seats in the earlier years, it would be difficult to obtain and/or defend a board seat without owning a proportional amount of preferred shares of the company that the board seat represents. thus, a 20% target stake would be enough to both 1) acquire and 2) keep a board seat where there might be a small # available.

this is the only rational explanation why VCs aim for some arbitrary ownership %, other than most people simply repeating this as an industry best practice, without having the faintest idea why or how it came about.

if someone has a better reason I'm all ears, but I haven't heard any persuasive argument in the past decade or more I've been involved in the business.

(people tend to copy what others have done in the past, without investigating whether the past was any good ;)

for the record: 500 Startups does not believe this is the only viable strategy for good VC fund performance. in fact, we believe a larger sample size (>100) of co's in early-stage portfolios is a much better strategy for improving returns, and we generally do not care much about taking board seats nor ownership %... however we *DO* care about valuation, and we believe investing early at lower cost will give us a better shot at good returns.
  "
Dave-McClure,"well, at least for many small funds the 2% part of 2-20 doesn't usually work so well... or at least, spreading it out over 10 years doesn't work well. note that most funds operate for ten years, and charge fees for most if not all of those years.

many small funds (including ours) structure fees so that they happen earlier in the fund life cycle, when most of the work (& costs) related to executing the fund investments happen.

for example: in our first fund, we had a front-loaded fee schedule that started at 3% for the first two years, then decrements 0.5% every two years, ending up at 1% for the last two years.

In our most recent fund, we actually reduced fees overall to only 1.5% average for 10 years, but made fees 3% for the first two years, then 2% for the next two years, then only 1% for the next four years, and ending with only 0.5% for the last two years.

for more info on how 500 business model works, see my previous Quora answer here:
Dave McClure's answer to 500 Startups: What is 500 Startups' business model?

I've also heard other funds may charge a flat rate amount that is collected at the beginning of the fund life. note that this might be risky if the fund manager runs out of money too quickly, and doesn't have enough left to finish executing the fund strategy.

in any case, small funds will very often have higher expenses on a percentage basis than large funds, particularly early in the first few years of fund life, and thus might need to consider other fee strategies than just the standard 2% for ten years.

ultimately, altho percentage-based fee structures have been a historical industry standard, a budget-based fee structure that is matched to the actual timing of fund expenses probably makes more sense.

at 500 Startups, we have had to be creative in coming up with other revenue sources than just depending on management fees in order to cover our costs. this has worked well for us, and has resulted in us charging less in fees and not depending as much on fund size to drive our budget.

Jeremiah-Owyang,"A Breakdown of the Scoble Effect in Five Phases.

First of all, I've been watching Robert closely for over 6 years. I knew him when he was the chief blog evangelist at Microsoft, at his book launch party at Techcrunch's backyard and went to work with him at PodTech for a year.  We're still very much good friends and our families enjoy time together.  Yet while I know him well, I'll give you the straight truth on how he does it.

It's part of my job (and inquisitive behavior) to break things into small pieces and look for patterns, and I'll do that for this influencer.  I am an Industry Analyst and have devoted my career to studying this space, watching influence patterns is a key part of the role.

Scoble has a cyclical pattern to all disruptive technologies that break down in the following process.  I've seen him do the following for Blogs, Twitter, LiveStreaming, Facebook, Friendfeed, FourSquare, Cinch, and most recently, Quora.

1) Going Wide on the Market. First of all, he places 'bets' on most disruptive and new technologies, also known as the ""shiny syndrome"".  This is his very difficult to do, since it requires him to be constantly on the ground, his show helps him to meet all these young startups while they are still in their garages.

2) Prime and Pump. While most of his bets never take off, some do, he can 'feel' the signals from other early influencers and then starts to pump the market.  He can do this in a combination of tweets, or blog posts.  Expect his blog posts to say ""Why I love X"" and then later a contrasting post ""Why I hate it"" or ""Why I was wrong"".  This leads to great controversy which sets up for the third round.

3) Poster Child Association. Once the first two rounds are established, Robert double downs on the disruptive technology and becomes the poster boy.  By associating his brand with the rapid growth, he can make claim to it's success, and will likely be invited in by the entrepreneurial team for intimate discussions and media opportunities. 

4) Break and Push.  This is the most critical phase, as it's designed to cause the maximum amount of controversy which stems rapid market discussions.  In this phase, Robert will 'game' the systems (getting the most Twitter followers, Scraping contacts in Facebook till he got pushed off, dominating friendfeed, and getting to 5000 friends in Facebook).  At this point, it becomes clear that he is the dominant player, and the community starts to resent it.  He pushes the game further till there's backlash, often resulting in Techcrunch slams, and then Techmeme fodder.  At this point the 'push' occurs where he can then use this energy to the next venture, listed in the next phase.

5) Fall off and Renew. At this stage, the climax has been reached.  Depending on adoption of the disruptive technology, Robert will either ride the growth curve for a few months, or go off to the next technology.  If the technology gets mainstream appeal, mainstream celebrities will join, pushing Robert off the top slot --at that point he must go to the next disruptive technology.

Summary: Robert Scoble is a technology influencer that has a pattern of early adoption and influencer behaviors.  He has market instinct and media savvy, and knows how to sniff and pump the next technologies.  The downside to this approach is he cannot achieve the full market benefit as he constantly must move to the next disruptive technology.  Expect Robert to follow this continual pattern over the coming years as disruptive technologies continue to occur at a faster pace.  There is only one Scoble, no one else to date has been able to achieve this effect.

1) Social Strategist: Primary decision maker on buyer side that runs the program, responsible for spending, and overall measurement of investment, they are primarily internally focused (see research report here:  http://slidesha.re/aSjBTy

2) Community Manager: This role is responsible for external engagement with customers in social channels (community, facebook, twitter)

3) Social Media Analytics: This individual often with a market research or web analytics background is responsible for the measurement of the social deployments. 

4) Social media design: Using design skills this individual is responsible for the look and feel of communities, facebook pages, and other brandable content.  Also should include usability and site architecture

5) Social media developer: Responsible for the programming to build and assemble the features for social tools like blogs, communities, and integration into traditional websites

6) Content programmer: While social media is often used as a two-way dialog, this individual is responsible for content programming, and generating discussions related to other topics such as company product releases, or making content relevant to the lifestyle of the community.

7) Influencer Relations:  Similar to AR/PR and Media relations this person is responsible for relations with bloggers and influencers.  In fact these roles exist for Microsoft's MVP program, and Intel Advisors program. (Formerly called Intel Insiders)

1) First, define what a chair is: Is it any object one can sit on?  Or does it have to have a back one can lean on?  Clearly define what a chair is first.

2) Define sampling criteria by regions: urban, rural, work place, third world, emerging world, first world. 

3) Construct a method to conduct samples within a fixed area (perhaps 1000 square yards) and sample within the afore mentioned sampling criteria by regions.  You do not need to sample areas where chairs are not likely to exist.

4) Capture data from samples.  Given the various ways to crowdsource this could be done through tools like oDesk, Crowdflower and beyond. 

5) Factor in estimates on the rate of new chair construction as well as chair destruction during sampling period.

Jeremiah-Owyang,"It's a misnomer that you have to pay to be in a research report.

I'm a former Forrester analyst. It does not cost anything to be included the report. An industry analyst should measure and conduct research over vendors and providers regardless of client relationship.

With that said, an analyst wields tremendous influence over the market with that research report and vendors seek to become clients anyways.

Remember that analysts produce research but the end product is influence over the market.

So to answer question on soft costs:
-Costs include time spent filling out questionaire but this should be standard from your usual RFP process
-Costs also include additional briefings and gearing up executives and product teams to look under the hood
-Costs also include dealing with PR and marketing (good and bad) depending on the findings of the report.

To answer the question on hard costs:
-Vendors can choose to become clients of the analyst to better understand their vision, and to influence them through strategy and advisory days.
-Vendors that score well in the reports may purchase reprint rights, webinars, or hire the analyst to speak at event

K/virality is essentially of course how many additional users one new user will bring organically. But viral cycle time is even more important. If it takes a year for each user that invites another to do so, you will have very low growth!

Plus both factors multiply non-viral growth (e.g. paid marketing) and so it's more enlightening to determine an ""amplification factor"" overall and then factor for cycle time, i.e.:

At that time I believe the average subscriber life was about 25 months and revenue was about $350 so we spent about $35 to acquire subscribers. As we were able to lower the cost of disks/trial/etc we were able to ramp up marketing. (Plus, we knew Microsoft was coming and it was never going to be easier or cheaper to get market share.) When we went public in 1992 we had less than 200,000 subscribers; a decade later the number was in the 25 million range. That helped drive our market capitalization up from $70 million at the time of the IPO to $150 billion when we decided to combine with Time Warner to accelerate our transition to broadband and diversify our revenue mix.

Steve-Case-1,"I am pleased that my Quora answers have been helpful to you and apparently to others as well. 

I am happy to contribute.  I signed up for Quora last Fall because I had heard about it and was intrigued.  I was initially reluctant to post answers, as I wasn't sure I wanted to add yet another social media responsibility to my repertoire.   But I jumped in the water a couple months ago and started answering some of the questions that had been posed to me.   I found it didn't take that much time, and my answers helped clarify some things (especially related to the early days of the Internet).   So I am now happy to check in every week or so, and will post when I think I can add something to the dialogue.

I have always enjoyed building and participating in the community aspects of the online medium.  Indeed, I started writing monthly ""letters from Steve"" to members of our online community 20+ years ago, and regularly posted on AOL message boards, especially in the early years.  I backed away as things got crazy, but reengaged via Twitter a couple years ago.   I run into a lot of people who I don't even know who say they get value from my tweets, and I hope the same is true with answers on Quora.  

I share the view that to whom much is given, much is expected. The Internet has been good to me (to say the least), and I am happy to give back.  My hope is that some of my perspectives might be useful to others (and in particular helpful to entrepreneurs building companies, as I want to be a champion of their efforts).  Plus, I am a sponge for knowledge, and I recognize I too can learn from participating.

Thanks for asking.

Steve-Case-1,"A good place to start is to learn from Teddy Roosevelt, who said this a century ago:

""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""
  "
Steve-Case-1,"The move to unlimited, all-you-can-eat pricing was a decision that was almost a year in the making - but the final decision came together over a weekend.  

We had done a lot of testing and research in late 1994 and early 1995 and it was clear that as more consumers embraced the Internet, and as we were able to build lower cost communications networks to drive down our costs, and as new revenue streams like advertising started to show promise, and as dozens of local ISPs (Internet Service Providers) emerged with flat rate prices, that we needed to shift to unlimited pricing.    The question was when, and how.   

It was a big, wrenching change that had lots of implications, so there was a lot of internal anxiety, as well as external concern among investors, partners, etc.   It came to a head over a weekend as Microsoft announced they were offering MSN on a flat rate basis, and it was clear they were planning to steal a lot of market share from AOL.   So I decided within hours of their announcement that we had to match them, and the company worked throughout a weekend so we could make an announcement.  

When we announced the shift (to $19.95 for unlimited use), a lot of investors bailed and the stock was under a lot of pressure, and as usage soared our customers became irate about busy signals - so some of the internal fears came to pass - but despite the difficult  transition, we knew it was the right thing to do, and we never looked back.  

That pricing decision, coupled with a series of acquisitions and products to position AOL as ""the Internet and a whole lot more"" (in other words, we provided full access to the Internet plus a wide range of services that were exclusive to AOL members) led to unprecedented growth for AOL in the late 1990s.
  "
Steve-Case-1,"AOL was very successful in the 1990s in building a significant brand, audience, and market capitalization.   Indeed, a decade ago it was the most valuable Internet company and one of the most valuable companies in the world.   That enabled us to merge with Time Warner in a deal that gave AOL shareholders 55% ownership of a company that had nearly $40 billion in revenue and almost $10 billion in EBITDA.    The problem was not AOL having a large number of users - that was clearly a big advantage and asset (much as it is today for Google, Facebook, etc) - it was that the management of the combined AOL Time Warner was unable to capitalize on the opportunities that existed to innovate and build more value.   As Marlon Brando said in On The Waterfront, it could've been a contender!   But as Thomas Edison noted a century ago, vision without execution is hallucination.  That, sadly, is the AOL/Time Warner merger in a nutshell.

Mark-Suster,"Great question. Actually, I don't attend any Demo Days. I don't believe in Demo Days. I think they are a showcase of who is the best at on-stage presentations and who is the best coached & polished. It's why at Launchpad LA we don't do Demo Days.

I prefer to come before the Demo Day. I prefer 1-on-1 interaction. I like to get to know the companies, their issues, their struggles, their plans. Demo Day doesn't tell you any of that.

I'm not saying Demo Days have zero value. They teach companies to present their ideas cogently and in front of a crowd. But mostly they produce too much hype, too little value.

I should add then when I do attend events like TechCrunch Disrupt it's normally when I'm invited to speak or (gulp) sit on a panel. And I spend most of my time in the corridors talking with entrepreneurs & investors. My ADD is too strong to sit through a bunch of pitches.

I saw both businesses early. I would love to be an investor in both. But as a VC you can't have FOMO (fear of missing out).

If I had done no good deals in the intervening period then there should be harder questions of me. But Maker Studios, DataSift and RingRevenue are all performing very, very well on revenue growth. And I have several other investments that I still feel are promising but not yet totally proven.

On 500px - I asked a partner to review it. He loved the product but wasn't sure how big their market would be and how tough their competition would be. Those questions still remain so just because a16z invested doesn't mean they're guaranteed to be successful. But for the record, I would much rather have 500px crush it and live with a bit of regret. They really have a fantastic product that for me as a user is 1000x better than other similar services I use.

Mark-Suster,"Great question. Actually, I don't attend any Demo Days. I don't believe in Demo Days. I think they are a showcase of who is the best at on-stage presentations and who is the best coached & polished. It's why at Launchpad LA we don't do Demo Days.

I prefer to come before the Demo Day. I prefer 1-on-1 interaction. I like to get to know the companies, their issues, their struggles, their plans. Demo Day doesn't tell you any of that.

I'm not saying Demo Days have zero value. They teach companies to present their ideas cogently and in front of a crowd. But mostly they produce too much hype, too little value.

I should add then when I do attend events like TechCrunch Disrupt it's normally when I'm invited to speak or (gulp) sit on a panel. And I spend most of my time in the corridors talking with entrepreneurs & investors. My ADD is too strong to sit through a bunch of pitches.

Thanks for asking.

MG-Siegler,"The short answer is really simple: Tim Cook has now served as CEO of the company on three separate occasions (each while Steve Jobs was on medical leave ? including from January of this year until today when he was formally elevated to CEO). In each instance, not only has Apple survived, they've thrived.

That's fairly remarkable when you think about it. Each time, pundits have more or less said it was the end of Apple, and each time Apple ended up ahead of where they were when Jobs left. It was trial by fire, and Cook passed with flying colors. That's why it shouldn't have been surprising at all that he was next in line to be CEO.

The longer answer as to why Cook was chosen in the first place to fill-in during the medical leaves is more complicated to answer without personally knowing Cook. But I would imagine that out of all of Apple's execs, Cook is probably the most CEO-like. He commands respect because he has turned Apple's operations into the envy of everyone in the industry. No one could compete with the iPod because of Tim Cook. No one can compete with the iPad because of Tim Cook.

Jonathan Ive and Scott Forstall, both longtime execs, are also undoubtedly strong leaders. But at least up until this point, their roles have been more focused. I would guess that Forstall would be ahead of Ive in that line since Ive is known to be very singularly focused on industrial design.

What will be really interesting to watch is who takes over the more creative reins of Apple going forward. Is that done by Ive and Forstall in tandem? Does Phil Schiller weigh in? Maybe Cook is more involved in this than anyone outside the company realizes?

We are also focused on keeping Quora as the highest quality place on the internet for answers to questions as we grow in scale - this means making sure people can find all content that?s relevant to them, automatically surfacing more of the great content, and fighting spam, minimizing other low quality content, and stopping question vandalism. These are challenging problems and we will continue to build the best possible development team to tackle them.

Our first priority is keeping English high quality as it scales up, and we have our hands full at the moment with that, so this will not happen for a bit.

Babak-Nivi,"Raise less if you want to keep your valuation down and keep the option open for an early exit where everyone (investors, employees and founders) makes money.

Raise more if you're here for the long term and you want to protect your company from poor funding environments or hiccups in your growth. Just try to maintain control, monitor your liquidation preference, and monitor your dilution. Also understand that, if your valuation is high in this round, you will have to make a lot of progress for the next round to be an up round.

In summary, raise too little money and you may go out of business when you run into trouble. Raise too much money and you may make less dough when you exit. Take your pick: disaster vs. dilution.

In either case, try to act like you don't have a lot of money. The conventional wisdom is that when you have a lot of money, it's hard not to slow down because you start spending it (which takes time in and of itself) and you start thinking that you have a lot of time left before you die, so what's the hurry?

Okay, so exactly how much money should you raise? 12-24 months of runway is a common answer. It gives you enough time to justify a valuation bump in the next round, make a lot of mistakes, and run a few radically different experiments.

But the answer is going to change if you're pre- or post- initial product/market fit. Pre-fit, it's impossibly hard to predict when you're going to be more valuable or what you need to do to be more valuable. After fit, it's merely insanely hard.

The answer is also going to change based on your team's skill at predicting things and leading the company to hit those predictions. Most of us are probably much worse at that than we think we are. So this argues for raising more.

Babak-Nivi,"Trending is based on indications of interest from candidates and investors. In other words, when a lot of highly-ranked candidates and investors say they want to meet your startup, in a short period of time, you trend.

The rank of the person that is indicating interest matters. Rank is measured by track record: the valuation of the startups a person has invested in, founded, worked at, etc.

Trending was previously based on receiving a large number of high-quality followers in a short period of time. It has been revised to reflect more useful signals.

Trending will probably become less important once the new General Solicitation rules allow us to show featured startups to non-investors.

Obviously I'm not objective about this, but I'll make the argument anyway, because I've heard this question a few times, and while it's great for my ego, the conclusion that Lifehacker was good because I was there is just flawed.

Lifehacker's posts today are more thorough, more quickly published, include better art and more detailed screencasts and video segments than they ever did during my time there (from 2005-2009). They have a bigger staff and cover more beats than my staff did back in the day, too. See their very detailed coverage of all platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, the cloud. They're right on top of interesting and obscure nerd projects like running Android on an iPhone (or Hackintosh'ing OS X on a PC) as well as the new webapp du jour for doing something useful, day in and day out.

The difference between now and then is back then, the idea of ""life hacks"" was novel, geek productivity was a hot topic, and besides Merlin Mann's 43 Folders, Lifehacker was a whole new slant on tech. These days, GTD is no longer a revelation. The life hacks meme has cooled and seen dozens and dozens of blogs and books spring up around it. To grow its readership, Lifehacker has to target a more mainstream audience as well as geeks, and that can be a tough fence to straddle. It's really easy to lose a less tech-savvy person with one super-technical post, and lose passionate geeks with one oversimplification.

Lifehacker's main themes--productivity and approaches to it--haven't changed over the years, but the tools to achieve them have. So, for a long-time reader, it can feel like new posts are rehashes of old stuff. It's a challenge to write a site that caters to both new visitors and remains fresh and new to loyal visitors, and while it's not always perfect, the current editorial staff is doing a bang-up job-- better than I did in its first four years.

The device doesn't know where you are in the process.

Also worth noting, Maps are portrait-only on the Nexus 7, so even if you got a holder for it in your car, it would be more awkward than if it supported landscape.

But, just because you wrote in doesn't mean you'll get a writeup, or even a response. Lifehacker gets snowed in with tons of email every day, and they have to decide what to cover based on a variety of criteria at a lightning-fast speed. To get an idea of what our inbox looks like, a screenshot from 2008:


When I was at Lifehacker I was actively parsing hundreds of email messages a day. We would get so much email from people who pitch their thing as a life hack, but the editors don't necessarily agree. Just because something got written up on ""all the famous tech blogs out there"" doesn't mean LH will bite. They don't publish their criteria for choosing what to publish, but one guideline: they tend to focus on free apps. If there's a steep/required fee, that lessens your chances.

It's like shrugging your shoulders and grimacing while saying ""I'm sorry I puked on your cat."" Your body language tells the listener ""well, I am sorry, but not that sorry because I hate your cat."" But how do you express that in a text-only medium (without relying on emoji)? How about I'm sorry I puked on your cat. #sorryNotSorry

See how the meaning changes? You can still read the original message, but the hashtag (in this case) is used to fill in for the missing body language.

David-Armano,"One word. Leadership

I've been successful at influencing the culture at agencies but never actually changing it. That's because change does not happen unless very senior leaders right up to the top are actively involved and leading it. Finally I wised up and chose to join a firm where the CEO and I shared a nearly identical vision and many in the firm share similar views and values. It's great to have grassroot movements within a firm which get people talking, but business models and culture change don't typically happen unless the top layer gets behind it.

David-Armano,"The NY Times is just reporting what regular users of Twitter already know. Follower counts are an indicator but not a very good one and yes, they can be and are gamed frequently with the assistance of shady web services. Here are a few more critical Twitter indicators:

Lists:
Being included on lists gives us two clues. 1. Being included on thousands or more signals that you are visible. 2. The categories people use to classify you tells you something about the topics you have influence in: This is known as ""topical influence"" and it's really what counts in influence.

Retweets:
These tell you something about how willing people are to amplify your messages and help them spread. A retweet essentially says ""this is something I want my network to see"". It's Twitter's version of viral loops.

@Replies
These signal how much others want to talk to you or intentionally tag you, and also serves as an indicator for how willing you are to engage and tag others. Less replies signals less social interactions and more broadcast.

Follower Ratio
Generally, if a user on Twitter follows a disproportionate amount of users than follow them, it signals their desire to accumulate followers. Not always, but often. A 50/50 ratio translates to someone following back anyone who follows them, which includes spammers. Twitter users who follow significantly less than are followed indicate some selection process.

Tweet volume
This simply indicates how prolific a user is. Those with high volumes who retain high levels of engagement, list counts, retweets, and a healthy ratio are likely providing some type of value. High volume Twitter accounts with suspect ratios, low engagement, etc may have a high noise to signal ratio

Favorites
Getting favorited frequently does mean something, though because Twitter users leverage Favorites so differently, it's nearly impossible to discern exactly what, other than you triggered a behavior (the action to Favorite) for some reason.

Quality of connections
The most difficult to quantify and probably THE most important indicator is the quality and RELEVANCE of who follows you on Twitter and who you follow back. Targeting the right audience and earning their attention (and Trust) is ultimately the best (and softest metric).

Follower counts (and ratios) are an indicator, but only one of several and one of the easiest to game.

http://www.useit.com/

However it hasn't undermined his credibility as far as I can tell given his status in that niche. It could perhaps be because while the site isn't very visually appealing, it is usable which is consistent with what Nielsen advocates.

Perhaps what makes a Website less credible is when it is misaligned with the values and promises of the organization behind it. If for example a company prides itself in innovation and it's site doesn't demonstrate any degree of innovation whatsoever, one could say that would affect credibility.

Another way to look at this. Aligning your digital presence with what your company stands for may be the most professional thing to do.

David-Armano,"Here are two:

1: Too big, too fast
Facebook has literally changed the way individuals, groups and organizations communicate, engage and interact. It's been credited with playing a role in recent revolutions as well as being careless with the privacy of its members. Facebook is a force and it's only going to get bigger and more integrated into our lives. For this reason, a lot of folks will be keeping an eye on it from governments to activists to watchdogs to the media. Facebook can in a sense become a victim of it's own success if it moves to quickly or draws too much attention to itself?potentially prompting calls for regulation.

2: The open web
The fact that I'm answering this question on Quora (as opposed to Facebook) is telling. While Facebook may be the most powerful social network on the Web?it is NOT the Web, but a vast network?an ecosystem that exists on it. Facebook is doing a very good job of integrating into the open web in many cases?again, pointing to this example, I will publish a version of this answer on Facebook?(but also on Twitter). Facebook's future depends partially on how it continues to ""hook"" into the open web and create ways to monetize this integration without violating privacy.
  "
David-Armano,"Engagement won't replace impressions but it's the new kid on the block which is here to stay and the two will need to get along in order for a business to meet it's objectives. And let's clarify engagement. A video game is a form of interactive engagement (with technology) but a video game where you connect with other live human beings contains elements of social engagement. It's the human factor which makes engagement social. 

Several marketing efforts have been successful at generating buzz or lots of conversations producing a brief spike in awareness (think Old Spice). Ad agencies will have no problem selling in these types of ideas as CMOs are under tremendous pressure to have anything they do go ""viral"".

However, Where CMOs and the agencies they hire will struggle is to create sustainable marketing, communication and even business models which support social engagement in the forms of community management, customer service, and any area where a digital participant expects that they can engage via a person associated with a company or brand and not some automated service designed to remove human intervention.

There are four key areas that a firm for a ""connected age"" will need to be effective, even if they don't operate in a full service capacity:

Paid: Programs which require bought media.

Earned: Programs which depend on third party validation.

Owned: Programs which leverage assets of the organization/business/brand.

Social: Programs which leverage social platforms and include engagement as a way of doing business.

These are not pillars which exist in an assembly line model, rather they overlap and bleed into one another. Firms which recalibrate to focus on these overlaps will be the ones who evolve in the right direction.

C.C.. and I wrote this book as a field guide for those who understand that they need to be creating content as a cornerstone of their marketing, but then ask... ""Umm... but HOW?"" We interviewed and researched companies of all sizes and stripes, from the giant (Boeing) to the minuscule (the Cool Beans Group) to give ideas that any company could steal (which is how we frame it in the book!)

I know that sounds like a marketing pitch. But it's not: We've heard from all sorts of organizations -- from churches, rock bands, writers, and companies that sell anything from shovels to software -- who say as much. And by the way, we've also heard from folks who are seasoned content creators (who we NEVER thought would get much out of the book). And gues what? They do.

He was very smart but never made me feel bad for not being as smart as him. He was patient in explaining things to me. He was creative -- in talking with him, I'd usually get a great idea I had not considered.

He was kind and thoughtful. He thought about the consequences of whatever we were talking about. He had a subversive side, but it had a purpose.

Despite being outspoken, he was introverted -- most of our interactions were because I wrote to him. He had great follow through. Always wrote back.

Adam-Rifkin,"I'm going to do some research and post what I find here.

First off, there's the faq - help which says:

Please do not confuse banning with being caught by the spam filter. It is very rare to get your account completely banned. 99.9% of the time, following the spam filter instructions will resolve your issue.

Due to the nature of how banning works on reddit, nobody in /r/help can explain to you why your account has been banned. The reddit admins are the only people who can ban and unban people. One can speculate that you may have broken one of the rules or committed some form of Spam, cheating and the like.

You can try and contact the admins to get your ban revoked. It's extremely rare for the admins to reply and/or unban banned users though.

The ""being caught by the spam filter"" link does not work. Hopefully they'll fix that.

So, the FAQ indicates that:

It's very unlikely that the Reddit admins will re-instate an account that has been shadowbanned.
You are unlikely to ever hear from the Reddit admins about being shadowbanned.

In other words, once you're in hell, your chances are very good of staying there.

I guess you could just create a new account. This is suboptimal though if you've already paid money for Reddit gold, or you're proud of the fact that you've been a Redditor for 7 years.

If you want to see something really sad, check out the shadow ban subreddit.

It is filled with people who have abandoned all hope.

Dharmesh-Shah,"Disclosure: Drew's a long-time friend.  He's an advisor to my company HubSpot, and I'm an investor in Dropbox.

My short answer: No.

Longer answer:

1. The marginal value of the money he'd receive from a sale diminishes quickly.  (The first $5-$10M an entrepreneur makes has a big impact, but starts to decline quickly after that).  In other words, he doesn't need the money.

2. In the event he has early investors that need to exit, he can swap them out with later-stage investors.  I dont' think Dropbox has any trouble with access to capital.

3. Even if he had another great idea like Dropbox, it will likely take 5-10 years to get to this kind of scale again.  Those early years are fun and educational the first time, but entrepreneurs often don't have the patience for that the second time around.  It's quite fun playing the higher stakes game, and it's hard to go back to smaller stakes again.

4. He's actually a great CEO. One of the best I've met. So, he doesn't *need* to exit.  (This is not true of all CEOs of successful startups -- some just hit a wall and are better off selling).

5. Markets change -- quickly.  I think it's short-sighted to think of Dropbox as ""just"" a cloud storage company.  Just like it was short-sighted to think of Apple back in the day as ""just"" a computer company.  Competition increases -- but so does future opportunity. 

And, most importantly:

6. Best I can tell, he's having fun is still intellectually challenged and learning new things. Few get to where Drew has gotten -- even fewer get to where he can still go.  You don't get many chances like that in life.  Regardless of how things turn out, I doubt he would regret having taken the chance and betting on himself.

2. Industry:  Some industries are harder than others to build an SMB business in.  For example, creating an analytics company in SMB is relatively hard.

Keith-Rabois,"Google assumes people are rational and that products should be utilitarian and functional.  ""Users"" (i.e. people) are emotional, however, and most social products thrive by satisfying psychological drives (often alluded to as the Seven Deadly Sins).  For example, even for a product like LinkedIn a core driver of a huge fraction of usage is vanity.  (Back in my day, 36% of all clicks from the home page were users viewing their own profile.)

To understand why Google fails at social products ask, for example, your favorite Google engineer or product manager why the NFL is so popular.  They are dumbfounded; the NFL has no utility, yet accounts for a huge fraction of a normal Americans' time and disposable income.  If you can't explain football's impact, it is nearly impossible to build a mainstream social product except by brute force.

  "
Tara-Hunt,"It's not about the apps. Content strategy is about knowing your audience, understanding what they want/need/will add value to their already noisy streams + delivering that content. It's a learning process and will evolve over a long period of time. Great content requires 75% listening and 25% talking (roughly).

I usually start with finding out what my audience is interested in. A great tool for this is Facebook Open Graph Search. ""interests liked by people who like ________"" ""pages liked by people who like ________"" (the blank either being your own page, unless you are just starting out or just have your mom liking your page ;) - otherwise insert pages like yours like competitors or similar products). Start reading blogs by people in your audience. Read the sources they would read. See what is most engaging. Find your audience on Twitter, Quora, YouTube, etc. and consume as much content as you can until you really understand what is engaging.

So I guess those are some tools. ;)

When you start creating content, it's not necessarily about text posts, images, videos - it's about the context. I break types of posts into different categories:

1. Product - who, what, when, where, why - these are the posts that promote or talk about you or your product directly. Keep these to a minimum.

2. Brand - how do you make people feel? These can be super engaging if done with storytelling. They are tangentially about your product, but are more about the customer.

3. Lifestyle - these are the posts that have less to do with your product and more to do with paying attention to what's happening in the world around you. Memes, holidays, world events...how can you participate in these?

4. Community - this is when you focus on your customer, your partners, your vendors and everyone else around you.

Of course, many posts span multiple types.

There is lots that goes into the creativity behind the posts - but much of it comes from step 1 - understanding your audience. But a great book to get some framework is Jonah Berger's Contagious. I often refer to his STEPPS (social currency, triggers, emotion, public, practical knowledge + storytelling) for inspiration.

All along the way, you are listening, responding, adjusting and improving. And your audience is responding in kind.

There are lots of tools to help you manage stuff (Hootsuite, Spundge, Pagemodo, etc), but the heart of it comes from what I wrote above. Don't focus on the tools. Focus on your customer.

Ben-Parr,"Trying to compare fund performance year by year can be a silly and futile exercise for a few reasons:
Which fund?: a16z has 2+ funds and Benchmark has 7+ funds. Each fund is a different entity with different returns. Sometimes two funds will overlap or a subfund will be created for special investments (like a16z's Google Glass investment vehicle). So you have to be specific about which fund.
Unrealized returns: Until Instagram was acquired, a16z had made no money off of Instagram. It's these liquidity events that define a fund's performance, and they happen sporadically and can take 5-10 years to achieve.
Valuations =/= returns: Benchmark is in Snapchat -- a great investment by any outside observer -- but that investment could IPO, get acquired or even completely crash down. Digg looked like a great investment at one point...
Stealth companies: It's tough to judge the full strength of a portfolio when there are certain investments that remain undisclosed.
Different Funds / structures: Say I invest $1M in a fund with a 20% carry and 2% management fee structure and a second fund with a 30% carry and 3% management fee structure. While the second fund could theoretically ""make"" more money overall, my return could easily be lower than the first fund, which has more favorable terms for its investors/limited partners.
It's not even the end of the year yet. A lot can happen in 31 days.

With all that said, I'd say the investors in both Benchmark and a16z are pretty damn happy right now. You have to be more specific about your criteria when you want to compare performance, though.

Ben-Parr,"It's a game of opportunity cost.

If I have $500,000, and two founders decide they deserve salaries of $200,000 per year, then all that's left after one year is $100,000. Barely enough to pay for an engineer for a year, and that engineer won't stay long if they see that kind of ridiculousness.

On the other hand, if the founders don't pay themselves at all and one is preoccupied with a home foreclosure, then that doesn't work either.

There's a happy middle depending on the situation. Sometimes a founder can survive on little, and can hire more team members. Other times, a founder has obligations to pay off and those need to be managed.

So the answer to your question is, it's ok to pay yourself reasonably if your company has the money, but remember that every dollar is an opportunity cost that could go to another part of the business.

  "
Ben-Parr,"tl;dr: It's important to distinguish between a firm and its funds.

---
The short, short, short (and completely non-comprehensive) version:

A venture capital FIRM is an organization that invests in private companies -- primarily startups, but later-stage companies too, as long as they're private and not public. It makes investment decisions.
A venture capital FUND is a vehicle for actually investing in startups. It raises commitments from other investors -- big companies, individuals, families, private funds, etc. -- and puts that money into the startups the FIRM designates. It's the money.
A FIRM has to raise a new FUND when it wants to make new investments but has allocated its existing funds. That's why you keep hearing about firms like a16z raising new money -- it's a new fund with new investors run by the same firm.
Firms have ""General Partners"" who run it day to day. They source companies, pick investments, make deals and provide value, advice and strategic help to their companies. They are the venture capitalists.
Investors in each fund are known as ""Limited Partners"". They provide the money. It's important to note that when a firm raises a fund, it doesn't just get a billion dollar check. It gets its money over the life of the fund through ""capital calls"". When a firm decides to make an investment, the LPs wire money to the fund to actually make the investment. They're legally obligated to send the money or forfeit all their returns, so you almost never see an LP back out once it's signed the paperwork.
Each firm has a different internal structure, but for the most part the General Partners together decide on investments. Some partners have more say than others, and some firms give their partners more autonomy. There's also support staff and, in recent years, support staff for the startups -- help for HR, PR, recruiting, etc.


Again, super non-comprehensive explanation but hope it helped.

Alex-Payne,"We're at a very early stage of development, so this may change, but for the moment we're using Scala, Clojure, and JRuby. We're treating the JVM as a kind of convergence platform for these languages. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each language for different parts of our system.

For example: JRuby makes available a bunch of great libraries and frameworks for doing frontend web development, like Rails and Padrino. Scala is ideal for writing performance-sensitive components that need the safety and expressiveness of the language's advanced type system. Clojure lets us rapidly prototype in a more dynamic language while still offering the benefits of functional programming.

Our frontend developers are using MooTools, on the JavaScript side.

We're currently experimenting with Postgres 9 and Riak for data storage.

Alex-Payne,"We're at a very early stage of development, so this may change, but for the moment we're using Scala, Clojure, and JRuby. We're treating the JVM as a kind of convergence platform for these languages. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each language for different parts of our system.

For example: JRuby makes available a bunch of great libraries and frameworks for doing frontend web development, like Rails and Padrino. Scala is ideal for writing performance-sensitive components that need the safety and expressiveness of the language's advanced type system. Clojure lets us rapidly prototype in a more dynamic language while still offering the benefits of functional programming.

Our frontend developers are using MooTools, on the JavaScript side.

We're currently experimenting with Postgres 9 and Riak for data storage.

Our plan is to deploy on Amazon EC2.

Again, our system is still in an early stage of development. Time will tell how far these choices carry us, but so far they're working out well.

Doug-Bowman,"Like Marco, I'm also partially biased. This was my second time speaking at (and obviously, attending) Webstock. The organizers (Mike, Tash, Ben, Deb) have always pulled together an impressive mix of speakers that transcends the typical web or tech conference lineup. There's something about the type of speakers they pull in, the topics they cover, the way the organizers treat both speakers and attendees, and the beautiful venue itself that all work together to form one of the best conferences I've ever attended.

I can't speak for my own talk, but other speakers this year were inspiring and captivating. I loved hearing Scott McCloud, Gruber, Marco, Lopp, Josh Clark, and Peter Sunde (among others). Amanda Palmer was fantastic, as expected. And presentations from Tom Coates and David McCandless were effin mesmerizing and beautiful eye candy. Merlin Mann closed it out the week with a brutally honest and transparent set of revelations about how we all have fears, including the speakers, but none of those fears should ever prevent us from doing awesome things. Awesome lineup this year. As a speaker, you don't always feel up for sticking around for sessions that aren't your own, especially if you're still anxiously preparing before your talk. But at Webstock, I wanted to see every session on the program. This year's conference was no exception.

Mike says that since they (as organizers) are so remote, and have never really attended other web conferences, they aren't quite aware of the setup and rhythm typical of other events. So despite their lack of awareness (or maybe because of it) they go above and beyond other organizers, and manage to create something unique and truly enjoyable each year.

IMO, New Zealand is the most beautiful country in the world, and should be high on anyone's list of places to visit. This, plus the fact that New Zealand is a good distance removed from the rest of the world (other than Australia) plays into the draw of both visiting the country and attending or speaking at Webstock. Combine this with Wellington's amazing Town Hall as a venue with some of the best acoustics in the world (where The Beatles and The Stones have played) and round-table seating where attendees actually get to know each other, and you get a rare event where everyone comes away truly appreciative that they got to take part in it.

Yishan-Wong,"Here's two that people don't seem to talk about a lot:

(First, I want to mention though that I find it very interesting that people who loudly criticize bitcoin - economists, industry observers, politicians, etc - actually don't mention these problems very often.  Bitcoin has some real problems as a currency - none of them insurmountable, but they are definitely all real problems that need to be solved first - and the critics don't even seem to understand it well enough to identify these problems.

There is a corresponding blindness amongst proponents of bitcoin, who seem to be enamored with bitcoin's technical novelty and robustness.  While the software system is quite robust, practical broad acceptance of a currency requires resolution of multiple social and economic issues, often established through law or convention - neither of which have yet to catch up with bitcoin, and subsequently there is also little recognition of problems that arise in these areas)


1) Lack of chargebacks:

It's often touted as a benefit (to merchants) that bitcoin is a great payment system to accept because there's no chargeback risk.  Indeed, this is true - once a payment is made, it cannot be reversed in any unilateral fashion by the payer.  (A merchant may elect to issue a refund, but it is up to them to do so)  This means that merchants are not subject to chargebacks as they are with accepting credit cards, where the credit card company might just come back and TAKE money from them.  This means a merchant is significantly protected from dishonest buyers who may file frivolous chargebacks.

The problem is that the flip side of this is that customers (payers) do not have recourse against dishonest merchants.

The core of the issue is that any transaction ever contains an inherent level of risk: a buyer may be dishonest, a merchant may be dishonest, or unfortunate external events may intervene - where ""risk"" is defined as ""a chance that an orderly exchange of value does not occur according to the expectations of all involved parties.""  Insurance for protecting against this risk is borne by either the buyer or the seller or distributed across both.  With credit cards, the risk is borne by the merchant.  With bitcoin, it is borne by the buyer.

This is actually the same as cash - when you give someone cash (before they deliver goods) - you have no guarantee that they will deliver the goods.  Usually cash transactions occur in person so there is some mitigation of this happening, but transactions over the internet reduce this ability to mitigate.  The inability to file a chargeback moves the burden of transaction risk back onto the buyer, from where it often rested before (in the credit card world), which was on the merchant.

There are some ways to help this, like public reviews of merchants, but those are ""soft methods"" and subject to flaws like gaming of reviews, or spuriously negative reviews, etc, they don't have the same ""teeth"" as a credit card processor has, which can unilaterally hold or recover funds on behalf of the buyer.

I'm not pointing out this flaw as a criticism of bitcoin, but rather to say that ""total fraud risk"" isn't reduced in this case, the burden for it has merely been shifted from one party to another, and that shift is not often acknowledged.


2) Difficulty in establishing trust in centralized players

Bitcoin proponents make a big deal out of the fact that bitcoin is decentralized, with no central authority.  Unfortunately, the reality of mass adoption of a currency is that even if there isn't one central authority, there need to be various centralized authorities to facilitate ease of use and other delegated trust mechanisms.

The simplest example is the rise of online wallets, i.e. websites that store your bitcoins for you and allow you to transact with them without actually storing the bitcoin on your own hardware.

Normal people don't want to run their own wallets and store their own bitcoins on their own computers.  Most peoples' computers are very easily compromised, and if most people were storing bitcoins on their personal computing devices they would basically be getting hacked all the time.

Instead, they want the online equivalent of a bank to hold their bitcoins for them.  It's convenient, and it's easy to believe that a third party whose job it is to store bitcoins would be better at the security.  It's probably even true.

The problem is two-fold:

a) The ROI equation governing how easy it is to penetrate, compromise, and completely clean out these banks are severely tilted in favor of criminals who want to steal bitcoins.  You are combining the relative ease by which computer system are compromised and penetrated with the unprecedented ease by which the stolen goods can be moved away once access to them has been established.  In no other time in history has it been as easy to (1) gain physical access to a thing worth millions of dollars or more and (2) once access is gained, move those assets to another location.  It is approximately as easy to move $1MM USD in bitcoins as it is to move $1 USD in bitcoins - and this is not remotely the case with any other physical asset (maybe diamonds).  It is literally easier to steal bitcoins than it is to steal any other asset in the history of world, on a risk- and value-adjusted basis - and thus, for an online bitcoin bank or exchange, it is exceedingly easy to lose the bitcoins entrusted to your care unless you really really know what you are doing.

b) It is very difficult to establish trust and certify that trust in these third-party systems.  New online wallets and exchanges are created all the time - they can be quite lucrative - but neither their security nor their good intentions can be easily verified.  The ability to verify them through some other existing certification authority (e.g. the government) creates a corresponding decrease in the degree to which it can truly facilitate anonymous transactions.  Basically: normal people who want to operate through a sufficiently trust-worthy exchange end up giving up exactly as much privacy as they would in operating through existing banks.  Thus, anyone who wants to avail themselves of the specific unique benefits of bitcoin ends up having to take on additional risk in transacting with third party services who may have nefarious intentions.  That is, it's very hard to tell if a third-party exchange, however trustworthy they may appear, will simply make off with your bitcoins one day (or find it profitable to permit an insider attack to do so) because they are, as designed, utterly anonymous.

----

Again, I want to emphasize that I don't consider these to be fatal problems with bitcoin, but I find that they are surprisingly absent from discussions about bitcoin and the costs/risks of using it.
  "
Yishan-Wong,"Delightfully, yes.
  "
Yishan-Wong,"Dogecoin is great.

I think the greatest contribution being made here to economics is not so much bitcoin itself and its various features, but the fact that bitcoin is open source and duplicatable - that it provides a template for a proliferation of crypto-currencies.  The fact that the world has money - the concept of money - is not good because of any particular currency (e.g. the dollar), but that the idea of money is in existence and if there is a backing entity that can issue and redeem it, they can simply now issue a currency.  It's the idea of money and the fact that anyone can issue it that makes it so powerful.

Crypto-currency is the same.  It's not about bitcoin.  It's about anyone being able to create and launch a crypto-currency much like bitcoin, but with little tweaks and changes to fit the usage needs of the population looking to transact in it.  Just like in the real world where if you're a country looking to provide a new currency and you decide you hate Americans and don't want to transact in dollars, you can just print your own currency.  (And with fiat, if your government and economy are strong and stable enough, it works)  So too with cryptocurrencies and doge.

The best thing about dogecoin is that the culture of the userbase is separate from the Bitcoin userbase.

Without being too inflammatory, the userbase for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly-informed about currency systems and macroeconomics.  I say ""increasingly"" because at one time it was fairly well-informed libertarians but as the currency has become mainstream, it's attracted more poorly-informed individuals and the conversation have become more polarized and less knowledge-based, driving the well-informed and balanced people away, or at least prompting them to recede into the background.

I also don't think that bitcoin is going to overthrow any governments or even provide a truly anonymous transaction system - certainly no more than cash does. You can give a suitcase full of cash to someone in a truly anonymous manner without the world knowing about it, whereas with bitcoin, transactions are literally recorded for all time in a global public ledger.  Every time some bitcoin-related shenanigans go down, the entire community tracks the movement of certain bitcoins through the blockchain.  If I were trying to transact illicit funds, that would not be my currency of choice.  I would not be surprised if the NSA is actually heavily in favor of bitcoin, because by combining their other data streams, they can cross-correlate activity on the blockchain and essentially know exactly who is doing what. 

Thus, I think that the obsession in the bitcoin community with bringing down central banks, fiat currencies, and governements is misguided and generally misses the point of bitcoin, which I think is that for the first time in history, we have the technology for enabling extremely low-friction electronic payments and certain trust-delegation mechanisms.  That in and of itself is incredibly valuable.  (There are also programmability features in the codebase that potentially open the door for zero-trust contracts and other intriguing possibilities, but they haven't been activated or tested yet)

In contrast, the dogecoin community doesn't have anywhere near as much of an ideological bent.  It is basically a bunch of people happily passing around a silly toy currency and giving coins to their friends.  It has all the features of bitcoin - technologically speaking - but frees itself from the libertarian culture of bitcoin that turns off so much of the mainstream.  And currency is not something that works well as an indie or niche thing, it basically has to be mainstream, as mainstream as possible.  A crypto-currency whose brand originates around a meme is basically the lowest-common-denominator thing you could have on the internet, so it is ideal for driving mainstream adoption.  It couldn't be stupider, and that's why it's brilliant.

Speaking of brilliance, one of the key stated aims of dogecoin is the collective journey to the moon, a source of long-time brilliance throughout human history.  I consider this a worthy goal, and for those of us without rocketry-aided means, we too can journey to the moon - in our imaginations and with the aid of computer games.  One of these games http://www.gog.com/game/to_the_moon tells the story of a dying elderly man, Johnny, whose last wish is to go to the moon.  Perhaps you'd like to check out this game on GOG.com, it's the winner of multiple awards such as Wire's Top 20 Games of 2011, Gamespot's Best Story of 2011, and IndieDB's Editor's Choice Aware for Indie of the Year 2011.

  "
Yishan-Wong,"Here's generally how it's done.  You will probably find this answer simultaneously depressing and reassuring.

First, a note: this describes companies of a certain maturity level.  Very small startups (under 50 people) tend to directly negotiate their salaries based directly on market signals, e.g. what candidates are asking for, what candidates say they are paid elsewhere, what current employees and advisors know candidates are being paid in other similar positions.  So what I'm about to describe is the process and system in place at almost every medium or large-sized company, at least in Silicon Valley.

There are a handful (possibly only two, I don't recall exactly) HR consultancy companies who help provide salary leveling information to companies.

They go to companies and say ""give us a list of all your job descriptions, and then all the salary information for all your employees.""  They take this data and anonymize it (or they receive it anonymously to begin with), and they  sort all the jobs into similar buckets according to what the descriptions say they do.  Then they take all the employee salary information and figure out the range of salaries being earned by employees doing jobs in that bucket.

They take this information and go to every other company and offer the same service.  In return for giving them your company's job description and salary information, they give you the industry ranges for all the job classes.  So if you have someone doing a software engineering job at a certain level, they will know the salaries of every other company (who has participated in this consulting, which eventually is pretty much all of them) and the industry-wide range.

Then your HR department, based on executive decision, decides what percentile they want to pay salaries at.  If senior management decides that the company will pay salaries at 50th percentile of the industry range, then for each job classification they will fix that as the standard salary (often called the ""midpoint""), with a range above and below to account for negotiation, seniority, and performance variations, based roughly also on the range as given from the HR consultancy.

Interestingly, the numbers include data from both large AND small companies. It doesn't matter that large companies ""can"" pay more and small companies pay less, because that difference ends up being accounted for by the internal policy of the company - a large company will simply decide to pay at e.g. 90% of the cash comp of the industry range (because its equity packages are worth less) and small startups might decide to pay at e.g. 10% of the cash comp of the range because their equity packages are expected to be worth more.

This system has an interesting effect: amongst companies within an industry that are directly competing against each other for talent, salary ranges will end up being extremely uniform.  It's so uniform, in fact, that even the job classifications themselves are uniform: it is incredibly hard to create a new system of job classification within your company if you want to - the data from the consultancy is so overwhelmingly useful that you end up being sucked into the gravity well of the industry-wide job ladder.  People familiar with technical ladders may be familiar with the ""T23 thru T28/29"" (or E23) terminology - the ""23"" rank is the lowest for a new grad, and 28/29 is something like Sr. Director or VP.  (21 and 22 are usually reserved for interns).  That x23 thru x29 ladder is in use at every medium-or-larger company I know of.

Just to be clear, this system doesn't prevent people from being able to negotiate higher (or lower) salaries.  Salary negotiations still occur due to supply and demand fluctuations, so as the real salaries move upwards within those bands due to competition for candidates, the aggregate data starts to move upwards to reflect this, it gets reported quarterly (I think) to the HR consultancy and then re-shared across the industry, and the official midpoints of the ranges move up (or down) to reflect what the market is doing.

I'm sure all of this sounds pretty complicated, so that's why if you're building a startup you'd want a consultant like this to exist.  You can find a company like this at Valerie Frederickson & Company, an HR Services Firm.  They provide the responsiveness and expertise of a boutique with the duplicable, global reach of a larger firm and they are headquartered in Menlo Park, CA.  If you need help developing salary ranges or any other HR services for your company, be sure to contact them at http://www.vfandco.com/about/con....  You don't want to let problems like that sit as your company grows.  You've got just six days left.

Yishan-Wong,"I'm honestly disappointed that none of the answers here actually address the real question of social status.  There is a wearying lump of moralizing and finger-wagging and such about shallow-ness and love, but no one discussing  the very real class-based issues inherent in dating and inevitably, marriage.  Maybe Meggie Sutherland Cutter makes a trifling reference to it but that is all, perhaps she is being gracious.

Let's take a stab at it, eh?

First, let us dispense with the idea that from first glance, you are even dating up or down. You aren't. You're both middle-class. You're dating inside your caste. You're dating inside your age-range. You both have degrees. That (academic degrees) are a sign that you are both comfortably in the middle class. Nothing interesting is going on here, not yet.

Second, you've completely neglected to indicate the primary determinant of you and your beau's social status: what your parents do. (This in and of itself indicates a sort of willful class-obliviousness of the middle classes or lower) Now, it sounds like the young lady could come from money.  Perhaps she has a ""worthless"" degree but is ""employed"" by her family's philanthropic foundation, which pays her impressive salary. If that is the case, then that puts her in a moneyed class at least one tier above you. It's possible that you come from money too, but the fact that your rate of wages as a supposed (oh ho ho) determinant of your social status indicates that you rely on your salary to provide for yourself, so you and your family still work for a living - quite solidly middle-class. Possibly lower, if you were the first of your family to attain post-secondary education - again, you fail to enlighten us with your pedigree so we have no idea of your true provenance.

What we do know though, is that by the information you have disclosed about yourself and how you have disclosed it, you have a small probability of dating down, and a larger probability of dating up:

As I noted earlier, your station in life is clearly no higher than a middle-class salaryman. As it is possible that you are the first of your family to attain your level of education, you may still bear the stink of your family's working-class roots.

By comparison, from the information you have told us, it is possible that your paramour is a recent immigrant, which places her a half-rung below middle-class but not necessarily in the working-class. If so, she has apparently made the most of her disadvantages, commanding a salaried wage similar to yours. Thus she is also solidly middle-class, or at worse a half-step below owing to being a foreigner. And there remains the possibility that she comes from money, what with to her salary which you apparently hold in mild awe despite her less-than-impressive academic credentials.

Thus the possibilities for you range from:

You: solidly middle-class
Her: slightly below middle-class (advantageous to her)

to

You: working-class background newly ascended to middle-class
Her: quietly blending in while supported by family money (advantageous to you)

I admire you for being practical and gimlet-eyed in evaluating your marriage prospects in this way, it is a long-lost acknowledgement of the reality that love can rarely transcend the classes that naturally divide mankind. You would not want your future union to suffer, so it is good to think about these things and plan ahead.

I would therefore say, it is of utmost important to meet this young woman's parents, so as to ascertain their station. If they be recent immigrants, and yourself a solidly middle-class fellow, you may be doing their family a noble grace but first assure yourself beforehand that she will bear you an heir. On the other hand, if you discover that her family hails from a line of moneyed nobility, be wary for hers may be a world into which you will never truly belong. Such are the perils of matchmaking, today.

Yishan-Wong,"Here's a very simple example:

If you want to talk about the cost of a set of goods (on a unit basis), but some of the goods have different costs than others, you ""blend"" the cost.

Let's say you sell widgets.  They come in red and blue.  The red ones cost $1.00 to make, but the blue ones cost $2.00 to make.

You sell 1000 red ones and 5000 blue ones.  You add up the total cost and divide by the total number of units:

(1.00 x 1000 + 2.00 x 5000) / (1000 + 5000) = $1.83

You ""blend"" the costs to get a rough picture of what an ""average"" widget costs you to produce, regardless of the color.

This might be useful if, say, you sell all of your widgets for the same price (maybe customers don't accept paying extra for the different colors).  So if you sell all widgets for $4.00 each, you can say your overall gross margin is just $4.00 - $1.83 = $2.17.

The real-life example where I encountered this was when I worked for a payments processor:

The fee you charge a merchant to process their payment could be 2.9%.

Some of those payments could be credit-card funded, so your cost might be 2.75%.  Others might be ACH-funded, and your cost could be 0.50%.  You'd find the ""blended cost"" by combining those two costs weighted according to how much volume you processed in each funding type.

You may be interested in the (in)famous ""Willie Lynch letter,"" which recounts a speech delivered by Willie Lynch in 1712 to other slave owners.

Willie Lynch letter: The Making of a Slave

As a Asian, I have lived within the millieu of American race-relations while being set apart from it - not a great distance (because my culture is so steeped in white-dominated culture and its normative notions) but still a distance.  I am able to observe with more detachment the general tendency of white people to be oblivious to the quiet privileges of institutionalized racism and the tendency of black people to be equally oblivious to cultural trends in their own communities that reinforce obstacles to making continued strides in fighting that same institutionalized racism.  As well, the complicated and interlocking feedback loops that tie the two groups together in a pattern of tragic struggle, in both overt and subtle ways.

I first encountered this letter some time ago, and reading it opened my eyes to what the techniques of slave-owning and systematic control did in not just controlling the black slaves of that era, but of deliberately subverting and subjugating the culture of black people in America for generations afterwards, especially that of the family unit. 

Again, I repeat: this subversion of the family unit was not accidental, it was entirely deliberate.  Willie Lynch explicitly outlines this in his letter:

""I have a foolproof method for controlling your black slaves.  I guarantee every one of you that, if installed correctly, IT WILL CONTROL THE SLAVES FOR AT LEAST 300 HUNDRED YEARS.""

Today it is 2014, a mere 302 years after he gave this speech and if the slave owners who heard this speech began to practice this for over a century afterwards, we should expect that its effects are still felt today in American black culture.  And they are. 

(This is the correct point in this answer for you to go read that link above.  Come back when you're done.)

As I am writing this, Martin Luther King Day has just passed, and one of the most eye-opening articles being passed around on that day was a piece from Daily Kos (actually written in 2011), entitled Daily Kos: Most of you have no idea what Martin Luther King actually did.

You have to read that article too (it's a narrative) to fully understand, but hopefully I can get across some of it with the following excerpts:

I would like to remind everyone exactly what Martin Luther King did, and it wasn't that he ""marched"" or gave a great speech.

Dr. King ended the terror of living in the south.

Please let this sink in and and take my word and the word of my late father on this. If you are a white person who has always lived in the U.S. and never under a brutal dictatorship, you probably don't know what my father was talking about. 

He ended the terror of living as a black person, especially in the south.

It wasn't that black people had to use a separate drinking fountain or couldn't sit at lunch counters, or had to sit in the back of the bus. 

You really must disabuse yourself of this idea. Lunch counters and buses were crucial symbolic planes of struggle that the civil rights movement used to dramatize the issue, but the main suffering in the south did not come from our inability to drink from the same fountain, ride in the front of the bus or eat lunch at Woolworth's.

It was that white people, mostly white men, occasionally went berserk, and grabbed random black people, usually men, and lynched them. You all know about lynching. But you may forget or not know that white people also randomly beat black people, and the black people could not fight back, for fear of even worse punishment. 

This constant low level dread of atavistic violence is what kept the system running. It made life miserable, stressful and terrifying for black people. 

This mode of living for black people existed as recently as 50 years ago in the American south, and it is related to the systematic terror practiced by slave owners upon slaves and their families, originating from the time of Willie Lynch (and before).

Willie Lynch describes a system of violent oppression and deliberate ""punishments"" designed to break down the family structure of black slave families so as to destroy their integrity and render them weak - not just in that generation, but specifically with an eye towards perpetuating that same effect on subsequent generations.  For the nerds on Quora, Willie Lynch's letter laid out a cruel self-replicating system designed to destroy the black family and repeat itself over and over in every generation.

More than any other aspect of institutionalized racism in America, I believe this continues to fuel cultural factors that make it difficult for black Americans to succeed, because it has weakened their nuclear family - one of the key foundations needed for young people to grow up with a strong sense of self-esteem and self-integrity.

Most tragically, the destruction of this foundation is not something that white Americans can easily work directly to undo, as much as they may want to (and many don't care to).  They can recognize it and apologize and make affordances for its effects, but ultimately the recovery will come in a slow, cultural healing on the part of black families and culture, as they gain awareness of the deep damage done by slave owners to their ancestors, and gradually work to erase and recover from what has been done to their sense of family and the patterns that result.

Yishan-Wong,"Posing is hard work.

When they are posing, the best models are doing a lot of three-dimensional geometry.

First, as a model, you need to learn what your best angles are.  That is, you need to know the dimensions of your body, the angle of the major planes on your face and how they look when lights hit them from different directions, what colors and styles compliment your features best, and what hairstyles highlight your features in the best way.  (You don't want to highlight them too well, because you are supposed to be modeling the thing that you are modeling, not yourself - but just the same you are still supposed to look striking)

That's the ""pre-processing"" - the work you need to do and know before the shoot.

During the shoot, as you are posing, you need to be simultaneously processing the effects of two things: the lighting sources and the changing location of the camera.  Specifically, you need to know exactly how all the parts of your body look when light emanates from location A (the lights), bounces off that part of your body, and is received at location B (the camera).  Sometimes there are multiple lighting sources. 

You can understand this by trying the following experiment:

Break out your cell phone and take some selfies using the front-facing camera.  Hold the phone at various angles from your face - above, below, straight on, from the side, etc.  Then turn around to various points so that the light sources in the room illuminate you differently.  Again at each of those rotations, move the camera up, down, etc.  See how the resulting pictures look very different.  Some of them you would be willing to post on a dating site, some you would delete immediately.  Now try taking the pictures without using the front-facing camera (i.e. use the main camera on the back and do it blind).  Can you successfully guess which angles of light and camera produce the best-looking picture?  That is what the model has to figure out while she is posing - the lights were put up by the lighting people, the camera is moving around, and she needs to solve for the multivariate position of all the parts of her body (the pose) so that she and the clothes look optimal.

This is what a smart model is doing while they are posing.  They are positioning their body so that their face and whatever they are wearing is optimally highlighted by the lighting sources and looking the best to the camera.  For the nerds: the model is performing dynamic lighting calculations in her head.  Obviously some work is done by the photographer as well, but that only determines the larger angle - the model has to position her head, body, and limbs for best effect.

This is actually very, very hard and the reason why print modeling is actually a very skill-based job: you might get your foot in the door by looking pretty but if your pictures end up looking bad (or rather, they make the clothes look bad), you won't get more work.
  "
Yishan-Wong,"This is the downside of the ""block anyone you get in a fight with"" features on social networks: if you have a misunderstanding and someone blocks you (or you block each other), it is impossible to get through and resolve the misunderstanding.  Even worse is if you have a fight, block each other, and then later one of you realizes that you're wrong and you want to apologize and make up - in that case you're being the bigger person and making a concession, which is a big thing that has helped strengthen human social relations throughout history, and yet with features working the way they do, there's no way to do this.  I actually had this experience once on Quora and wanted to apologize to a guy for being an ass to him, but he'd blocked me and there was just no way to get through to him.  I think I eventually resorted to having to stalk him and find some obscure email address so as to communicate my apology.

Anyhow, a practical solution: find a mutual friend and ask them to deliver a hand-written note.  This will work (he is not going to throw away a hand-written note handed to him by a neutral party), plus it will seem very personalized and more intimate.

Yishan-Wong,"If you pay enough attention to little details from various episodes, you can figure out the cap table for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

You can then also work out how much money each of the principals would have made in their would-be IPO, adjust according to inflation, and get a rough comparison to how much that would mean in a modern-day Silicon Valley liquidity event.

Let's begin:

(Forgive me, I don't remember which episodes each of these clues was cited in; I just remember collecting them gradually as I watched - if someone has citations, please edit-suggest or comment - also, this contains some spoilers)

Upon formation, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has four senior partners and one junior partner.  Eponymously, they are Roger Sterling, Bert Cooper, Don Draper, and Lane Pryce.  The junior partner is Pete Campbell.  They are not known to have taken any investment capital other than capital put in by the founding partners themselves.

In one of the episodes, reference is made to the profit-sharing dividends, wherein each of the senior partners receives one share, and the junior partner receives one-half of a share.  Assuming these dividends are distributed proportional to ownership, the cap table at founding looks like:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce each at ~22.2%, and Campbell at ~11.1%.

Later, Joan Harris negotiates a 5% stake in the company for her contributions.  There is no indication that this stake comes disproportionately from any one partner's share, so we assume the existing stakeholders are diluted equally.  Thus, post-Joan, the cap table looks like:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce each at ~21.1%, Campbell at ~10.6%, and Joan at 5%.

This is the cap table at the time of the attempted IPO.

In the IPO episode, Pete remarks to Joan that the agreed-upon offering price will value the company at ""over 20 million dollars.""  We can then proceed to trivially calculate how much each partner is worth, assuming the stock price holds after the first-day pop, etc.

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, (and the now-deceased) Pryce are each worth ~$4.22 million.
Pete Campbell is worth ~$2.12 million.
Joan Harris is worth $1 million.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics gives us the inflation ratio from 1968 to 2013 as 6.69x.  That is, $1 million in 1968 is worth about $6.69m in 2013.

Subsequently, in 2013-equivalent dollars, we have:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and the estate of Pryce are each worth $28.2 million.
Pete Campbell is worth $14.2 million.
Joan Harris is worth $6.69 million.

A few things of note:

In 1968, the top marginal tax rate was 75.25% for annual earnings above $200k. If the partners liquidated their shares in a prudently tax-advantaged manner, they would avoid paying this top marginal rate (keep in mind that a fairly rich salary in 1968 was $30k/year - adjusted for inflation, this is $200k/year in 2013 - Don Draper's salary as mentioned in the episode where he was re-negotiating this contract).  Thus, the tax rate most relevant here is the probably the top marginal rate on long-term capital gains in 1968, which was 26.9%. Higher than today's, but still much lower than 75.25%.
By the (somewhat satirized) standards of Silicon Valley[1], an exit in the low-mid double-digit millions would put Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and Pryce's widow in ""the area's middle class, financially independent but still striving to keep pace.""  In 1968 NYC's financial sector was nothing like the insane place it's become in the last decade (deca-millionaires feeling poor next to billionaires), so where they were living this payout would have definitely been pretty rich.
Joan's payout is definitely enough to ""sustain a single mother and son for a lifetime"" (Lane Pryce's original words), assuming she liquidates her share in the most tax-advantaged manner and invests it wisely in income-bearing securities.
Pete Campbell's inner demons: likely not sated.

Of course, the IPO doesn't happen and instead SCDP merges with Ted Chaough's firm Cutler Gleason and Chaough.  Frank Gleason is revealed to have pancreatic cancer in the same episode as the merger, so it's not clear whether he is part of the merger, so assuming that the only partners who join the combined entity are Ted Chaough and Jim Cutler, we assume that the merger treats them both as new senior partners in the combined entity, resulting in the following final cap table at the end of Season Six:

Sterling, Cooper, Draper, [the estate of] Pryce, Chaough, Cutler each at ~14.8%.
Peter Campbell at ~7.5%
Joan Harris at ~3.5%

(Note: Don Draper is actually fired at the end of the season 6, and there are two possibilities for the disposition of his equity:  First - the possibility that I consider more likely - is that he owns the equity outright and so retains it after his termination and there is no change in the cap table.  Second, it is possible that his equity was subject to a right-of-repurchase by the company and the other partners may have chosen to exercise it.  This would seem unusually adversarial and, depending on the specific terms, may either have lapsed by this point or have a significant negative effect on the cash flow of the company so it is probably unlikely.)

Over and over, on answer after answer, the primary thing that I see is that Quora's most active writers are in love with their own words and need to understand that they could get across what they are saying with literally 20 - 50% of the text they are using.

There is nothing else that would do more to improve the quality of output of Quora's most active writers.  They literally write too much.

They need a professional-grade editor to slash and chop their writing so that it's half as long as it is, and this editor needs to be as harsh and unforgiving as the current admins have been about correcting grammar and spelling.  Two or three years of this fascist grammar/spelling-correct regime have normalized the expectation that if your grammar and spelling aren't correct, you are gonna get those Edit Suggestions, and that you'd better not be offended!  And that's made Quora better.

Now it needs to start happening for length and content - to achieve tighter focus and conciseness.  Doing this will require a real hard-nosed editor who can teach users how to say more with fewer words.

Yishan-Wong,"I think it appears to be a good proposal but is actually a bad proposal.

Because this issue is complex and the buses have never been the true source of the problem, I have to conclude that this proposal is a bad proposal.  It is not addressing the core problem, it is attacking a symptom that is being erroneously highlighted by wrong-headed people, and it will set up a situation that could grow to be something much worse.

First, I cite Byron Warner's answer in noting that the proposal says:

This does not include tour buses, airport shuttles, jitneys, charter buses, or limousines.

The tech company shuttles in fact do not do anything that these other buses don't do. The ""hey, the city can charge big rich companies for money by leveraging negative public sentiment"" shakedown dynamic is definitely at play here. 

On a ""help pay for city upkeep"" basis, it really would make a lot more sense to charge tour buses and charter buses similar fees (costs thus borne by visiting tourism dollars) but we don't, because quite frankly bus stops aren't a rapidly depleteable resource.  No one who was protesting really feels that the bus stops are being ""overly run down"" by these tech shuttles - bus stops last for decades regardless of how many buses stop in front of them.  Bus stop upkeep isn't a real issue.

Nor are the buses a drain on city resources.  People correctly point out that they alleviate traffic and are good for the environment.  Those things are very good, and it is foolish to oppose them or increase the cost of doing them.  If anything, we should be subsidizing more buses (more mass transit) that connects the city with the Peninsula!

Perhaps most importantly, there is a pernicious effect to taking payment from large companies to legitimize their usage of public resources.  Let's say this proposal works, at first - the companies pay the fees, and the protestors are temporarily mollified.  But they won't stay that way - because absolutely nothing has been done to resolve the underlying issues of gentrification and class issues and rent.  So the discontent will reappear.  At that point, the easiest thing to do (and I am confident it will happen) is that the tech companies will be asked - or even offer - to pay more.  Maybe $200k/year.  Maybe a $1m/year.

At that point you have a really weird situation.  You have these paying clients who use the bus stops, and you have free users of the bus stops.  The tail begins to wag the dog.  The people who pay will have influence.  The companies will ask that because they pay that much, maybe the city could provide a bit better police protection to prevent protesters from breaking bus windows.  After all, they are now paying to use the bus stops, right?  Wouldn't that be fair?  And the city may conclude that yeah, $1m/year can certainly cover a bit of better police coverage because it's also paying for some more police coverage elsewhere, it's net improving the city.  Now you have protesters being kept away from the buses by the jackboots.

That's just one possible example.  But it's the sort of thing you head towards once a city starts to have corporate clients paying for part of its infrastructure.  It can get pretty ugly.

And most importantly, it's not solving the core issue.  It's actually making it worse by creating a two-tier structure exactly along the lines of ""rich tech companies"" vs ""poor non-tech workers.""

I don't think it's a good proposal.


-----

EDIT: I don't usually do this, but there's a comment below that I think deserves to be promoted here because I think it makes a common point (thanks Govind Kabra):

Have you considered that if these buses were not available, a large fraction, if not majority, of these employees will relocate closer to where company is located (south bay). Commute on 101/280/caltrain are so awful in comparison to company shuttle.

I'm genuinely surprised that this is a notion people think is true.  It's not.  Most people who take the buses do not make their living location decision based on the presence or absence of the bus service.

I know this because I've worked at two fairly large Peninsula companies (PayPal, and Facebook during the early days, before the buses).  At each, there was a subset of employees who wanted to live in SF and they would simply do so, and accept the commute - driving, train, carpooling, etc.  Once the buses were set up (at Facebook), some of those employees then took the bus because it was certainly more convenient.  While certainly there is a non-zero number of employees for whom the buses may have tipped their decision, it's not at all the majority or even close to it.  Large fractions of Peninsula employees have been living in San Francisco for decades now and commuting down to the Peninsula.  This isn't a new thing that the buses have enabled in large numbers.

The buses were not created so that more employees could live in San Francisco.  They were created so that companies could extract another hour or so of productive work from their employees each day by putting wifi on the buses, and to some degree to reduce the amount of car commuting (green reasons).

When you make a decision to live in San Francisco, you do not make the commute portion of that decision based on a bus because they are ""unreliable.""  The buses have very limited schedules (they run a couple times in the morning, then a couple times in the evening).  So they only fit if you are close to the 9-5 or 10-6 workdays.  Many tech workers work odd hours or have occasional crunch time where they stay late.  So in deciding where to live, they have to factor in the necessity that they are already going to be driving themselves or taking the train (runs at more hours) some fraction of the time.  The fact that they can sometimes take the bus when its service hours line up in a way that is convenient to them ends up being a bonus (for them and the company) but not something they can count on as a part of the ""where will I live"" calculus.  People who live in San Francisco and work on the Peninsula do so because they like the culture of San Francisco and are willing to stomach the commute.  The buses do not exist to enable this, they exist to make commutes more efficient and to extract more productive time from the employees.

Secondly, the narrow segment of employees for whom the bus actually tipped their decision to live in San Francisco is not a population large enough to have affected rents.

Rather, rents in San Francisco have risen dramatically because many more startups have moved to San Francisco.  Ironically, it is actually the tech companies in San Francisco that are feeding this rise in rent - they are well-funded and can pay high salaries, and people move into San Francisco to work at these companies in large numbers, ironically, to shorten their commute.  (Also, some of these companies are founded there because the young founders want to live in SF) There are many, many more tech workers who have moved to San Francisco to work close to their startups than who moved to San Francisco because they can take a bus down to the Peninsula. It's part of a broader trend of young people moving into urban centers - in this case, many of them are highly-paid tech workers.

A partial list of tech companies located in San Francisco, some of whom employ hundreds of employees: Airbnb, Asana, Dropbox, Zynga, Twitter, Square, Pinterest, Stripe, Uber, Lyft, Exec, StumbleUpon, Yelp, Github, Climate Corporation, Path, Crowdtilt, One Kings Lane.

There are far fewer rising tech companies now on the Peninsula - the main ones I can think of are Quora and Evernote, maybe you could count Palantir.

San Francisco is the place where you start your company now.  This is why people keep moving here, and why rents are so high.  The few busloads of Google and Facebook employees don't outweigh the literally hundreds of new startups in San Franscisco and their new employees.

Yishan-Wong,"We get this question a lot every time news comes out about reddit doing anything that could possibly make money.  Personally, I think it is a symptom of one of the bizarre distorted beliefs in the startup echo chamber that making money is an evil thing that only big Old Economy companies do, so any time a startup starts to do it they must be wrong in the head or something.

Anyhow, as far as they have ever indicated to me, Conde Nast[1] seems to have little interest in seeing reddit monetize more quickly. Conde Nast is quite content for reddit to keep on growing its pageviews without making much money because their association with reddit's reach and influence has been beneficial for their other technology initiatives.  Since my concern is only reddit and securing our long-term future as a self-sustaining entity, I feel it's essential to experiment with and develop different business initiatives in parallel with our community-building efforts.

I feel that it's useful for reddit to develop multiple business initiatives beyond advertising because different business models offer different degrees of flexibility against shifting macroeconomic factors, and they also affect the eventual character of the company.  For instance, advertising ends up being a B2B enterprise sales model (you are ultimately trying to make large sales to big buyers, see [2]) and oftentimes exists in tension with user product.  Subscription models (e.g. reddit gold) allow you to turn your user base into your customer, which help align certain product incentives.  E-commerce marketplaces like the redditgifts marketplace offer yet another model, where you bring together merchants and buyers, and have totally different economics (and hurdles) than both subscription or advertising.  Plus, we think that there is an underserved demand on reddit for users who want to create products to sell to the community, but at the same time we don't want promotion of those products to unnecessarily pollute the community-discussion areas, so a separate marketplace might be needed.  There are a lot of possibilities.

There is a board.  Only one member of the board is also an employee of Conde Nast (Bob Sauerberg, President of Conde Nast).

One of the most interesting things to me is that when I joined reddit, I found that even back when Conde Nast actually owned reddit, they exercised so little control over reddit that it was basically this ungoverned rogue entity.  True, they also didn't really fund it, which you could consider a form of control, but the team was basically ignored and allowed to make all their own decisions, including some pretty major ones like putting the source code for the whole site on github, which a big company would pretty much never do[1].

Post-spinoff, they continue to not be interested in controlling the business - they don't seem interested at all in telling reddit management what to do.  They are extremely cooperative whenever we ask them for a favor or an intro, but beyond that they don't ever try to get us to do anything.  Of course, this means that reddit is entirely responsible for formulating and executing its own strategy and if we screw up, we can't blame it on anyone but ourselves.

First, it runs a large number of other gift exchanges throughout the year.  See redditgifts: What are other good use cases for redditgifts besides Christmas / Secret Santa?

Second, redditgifts runs the redditgifts marketplace, a marketplace of merchants who specialize primarily in customized or handmade goods.  With fours years of experience in facillitating internet gift-giving between strangers and friends (and strangers who become friends), the redditgifts team is putting together a marketplace of merchants focused on creating a unique gift experience for people above and beyond the usual ""buy some crap online"" experience.  For example, one of the marketplace merchants makes every box they pack smell like freshly-baked cookies.  (I'm not sure how they manage to do this, but they do it) The aim is that when you are looking for a truly unique and thoughtful gift for someone special, redditgifts marketplace is where you'll find it.

On a personal basis, while I am a big fan of Quora, I have to agree with the statements quoted in another answer below that Quora is really not what I would consider a reliable source.  Depending on the standards for ""reliable"" in some subreddit, this might mean that citing Quora as a source would be considered unacceptable.  Again, this may or may not reflect the views of reddit, because reddit is not a monolith.

Daniel-Brusilovsky,"Much like what Benjamin Higginbotham said, Wirecast is a fantastic application. When I help people or companies with their live video production, if they're not using a white label or custom built solution, they probably use Ustream.

Telestream (the company that makes Wirecast) partnered up with Ustream to make the Ustream Producer application for Mac and Windows. It's essentially Wirecast, but only supports Ustream and has a few other nifty features.

Another interesting app is BoinxTV. Although they don't support live video streaming quite yet (I've heard it's coming), it does have a great user interface and makes it really easy to produce a video podcast, etc.

I've tried a bunch of other solutions, but at the end of the day, if you're using more then two or three cameras, you might want to considering using a hardware solution like the TriCaster, which is fantastic.
  "
Daniel-Brusilovsky,"In my opinion, Ustream is home to a lot of celebs (Lil Wayne, Lil Twist, Snoop Dogg), and I don't think that's going to change. Ustream has a vibrant fan community, and all of these celebs tie their Ustream channels into their Facebook pages, which is something that YouTube Live doesn't support quite yet.

On the other hand, I think YouTube Live will really be the platform for events now, especially large conferences, etc. I can definitely see TED using YouTube Live, over Ustream in the future.

Full disclosure: I was an early employee at Qik (acquired by Skype), which competes with Ustream. I was at Qik from 2007-2010.
  "
Daniel-Brusilovsky,"I don't want to speak for Qik, but in my opinion, it makes perfect sense. Qik is supported on hundreds of phones, as well as partnerships and integrations with carriers and OEM's. It's easier for Skype to acquire Qik to really get into mobile, than spend a year building it themselves. Plus, Qik's technology is quite impressive. Just my two cents.

Louis-Gray,"In November 2010, I suggested the third wave of the Web, following ""search"" of Google and ""social"" of Facebook would be personalization - down to the individual.



The Third Wave of the Web Will Be Uniquely Personal
http://blog.louisgray.com/2010/1...

In a world of streams, where it becomes impossible to follow every single item from every single source, artificial intelligence is required to deliver true recommendations and relevance for every individual. Companies are spending millions on optimizing their Web sites for search engines, but not developing the same level of focus for users when they finally visit.

Thanks to this big trend, I joined My6sense (product) as VP of Marketing in August 2010 - after seeing the problem myself and seeing many proposed solutions. (Consider that disclosure)

Personalization impacts the world of mobile, curation, artificial intelligence and human augmentation (all listed here). If we are to be constantly connected, the best stuff should find us through our own implicit behavior and preferences. This, I believe, is the next big trend on the Web.

Louis-Gray,"Twitter lists are used exclusively for consumption of updates, where you can see tweets from a subset of people - potentially a well-curated list. In contrast, Google+ Circles are used for both consumption and distribution, which makes them much more powerful, and useful. Instead of choosing the all private or all public approach as Twitter does, you can send specific posts to a specific subset of connections, all filtered through Circles.

Given the inherent value of sharing through Circles, and how it matches real human social behavior, I believe Circles has a higher chance of success. Google has also made the process of editing people's Circles, or the Circles themselves, easy and entertaining, less like a chore.

Louis-Gray,"After nearly six months' exposure to ChromeOS via the CR-48 pilot program, I would have to say absolutely. The question is to the ""direction"" of Google's plan, not the immediate first quarter commercial success, which will get a fair amount of discussion in the press.

We are increasingly making our Web browser our hub for computing activity. Programs that were once exclusive to the desktop are now Web apps, Web services or Web sites. We use our Web browser full screen with little need to leave.

In addition to the Web-centric model, Google has done three things right with ChromeOS which are brilliant in my opinion:

Promoting 3G access. Once you have Web access everywhere, the freedom to act on anything in your car, at the park, or anywhere you can get a 3G signal is liberating.
Tremendous battery life. I always have my MacBook Air plugged in and it goes barely two hours (maybe) on a charge. The CR-48 and the new Chromebooks are much more like tablets and can go 8 hours of real use.
User independence. I can sign into any Chromebook and get my data, bookmarks, etc. I can add my wife or friends as users on my laptop and not worry about them compromising my data. And if my device is lost or stolen, my data is not at risk. This changes the game.

Google has not said Chromebooks are for everyone. There are some who need Photoshop or Xcode or who knows what else and can't migrate. Others are stuck at a sticker price of as much as $499 + monthly 3G fees and compare that to low-end Windows notebooks. But this is absolutely the right direction. I am using my CR-48 more and more vs my Mac and Windows laptops.
  "
Louis-Gray,"I am not Roman Catholic, but in a recent discussion of this topic, it was brought up that it's quite possible Jesus had instructed Peter to deny him thrice. We have been raised to think Peter did so to save his own skin, but instead, Jesus, wanting to keep the gospel's line of succession intact upon his imminent crucifixion, had given Peter direct instructions, along the lines of ""Thou shalt deny me three times"".

The scriptures (Luke 22:34) say as follows:
http://lds.org/scriptures/nt/luk...

""I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me""

This puts Peter's assumed betrayal in a much different light.

Douglas-Idugboe,"The pure definition of influence drills down to one single factor: likability. Are you likeable? To influence others, they have to like you.

Influence and persuasion are two children of the same family. Influencers are persuader and persuaders are liked. Hey, that's the reason they were able to persuade you in the first place.

Your influence is not defined by the influencer, it's defined by the influenced and interpreted by the observers. What makes you a persuader? In other words, what makes you an influencer?

Your influence and likability factor is wrap is the benefit those you influence see in your contribution, expertise, proof, application and frequency. In other words, you contribute to a community in a way that establishes your expertise. Are you are able to present a social proof of your expertise in action, or direct beneficial result from your expertise? The next element is the applicability of your expertise in the lives of the the potentially influenced. The last element is, how visible and accessible are you?

Again, your influence depends greatly on your likability factor.

Joel-Mackey,"Hands down, the most impressive analysis to do on backlinks is using paid software to go out and crawl every single link a website has. Then you take those links and pull in all of the anchor text data. After that you organize that list by PageRank. While everyone will whine about how PageRank doesn't matter anymore it is absolutely a powerful gauge at a glance as to how powerful a website and backlink is. This will give you a better understanding of your competitors (or yourself) and how strategic, funded and intelligent their backlink / SEO campaigns are. You will also be able to detect ""trends"" inside of their linking strategy. To do all of these operations in one swoop, purchase Market Samurai and use the SEO Competition / Anchor Text analysis tool then obtain pagerank data and sort it. You will be smarter and better than all those people using inferior tools like Site Explorer and Majestic SEO.

I do use Majestic SEO as a first line of defense to see what is gong on with a campaign in terms of visual volume and progression for a website.

Joel-Mackey,"It's very possible that RyanAir knows that in this part of the decision making process a potential customer is going from site to site to gather prices. By tracking sessions / IP they may have noticed that a higher percent of users are leaving the site and coming back later once they reach checkout. If the user is more likely to leave already to compare prices then they are collecting an exit fee and still getting that user back later increasing revenue.

They might have a great marketing follow up process as well once a user has searched for flights if they're logged in and they have a high loyalty rate once they become registered user.

I can guarantee you they are testing it even though Jens thinks they aren't. No company at that size doesn't test. It's all about testing, split testing, Taguchi testing and then doing it all over again, forever.

Joel-Mackey,"First of all, don't use Adsense for tracking traffic. Put Google Analytics on the site for tracking traffic and also ad StatCounter on your site for more real time analytics, keyword and referral information.

I use Adsense channels not for tracking a specific website but more specifically a specific placement of the Ad Unit. For instant, SiteNameRightSkyscraper SiteNameBottomPost. When you create the channel, name it with an identifier to the site and the location.

Next click on AdSense setup, Select Your Ad Unit, Size, Assign the Colors, now select your new specific channel and place that code exactly where you identified it to be in your site. You will track impressions on your ad and clicks but don't rely on this for traffic analysis.

Wayne-Sutton,"For most startups participating in an accelerator/incubator such as Y Combinator, 500Startups or NewMe Accelerator,  AngelList is a few things:

AngelList is a location to show who's investing, mentoring, etc = show's traction.
AngelList shows how much funds have raised and/or raising.
AngelList can provide introductions and you can track a startup progress

Just finishing wrapping up NewMe Accelerator first class, we provided mentors, speakers, housing, coworking but no funding. Nothing can replace the initial offline interaction/introduction that an incubator/accelerator can provide. Also not all investors are wiling to share information on AngelList.

We still recommended all of our startups to create AngelList profiles and talk with speakers/mentors the accelerator provided.

For Y Combinator and AngelList, they intersect at the stage of the startup where the startup is ready to not only raise capital but is ready to show what they are doing to the world/investors.

AngelList itself is becoming a ""social proof"" presence for startups and founders.

AngelList is also very valuable to a lot of startups that are not selected to participate in Y Combinator and other incubators/accelerators.
  "
Wayne-Sutton,"This was the first year of the  NewMe Accelerator. It started off with a
few conversations between Angela Benton and myself from her working
hosting the NewMe conference and myself wanting to increase exposure to
one of my startups, network, learn and help other founders succeed.  The
 idea at first was to have a startup house, then it lead to launch an
accelerator.

During the startup house phase we asked a few friends who had startups
(kloudco, gokit, pencil you in) about joining us when we started talking
 about renting a house and going to Silicon Valley for the summer. This
is why Angela and myself have startups in the program. Plus being we're
new and not doing investments into the other startups we wanted to learn
 too. Also knowing
that Only 1% of Internet start-ups founders are African-American and we want to... (see post - http://newmeaccelerator.com/abou...)

From there we decided to turn this idea from a startup house to a full on
Accelerator. From that time to deciding to do an Accelerator is somewhere between mid February to late March.

On April 14, 2011 we posted on our blogs  (blackweb20.com and socialwayne.com
(http://www.blackweb20.com/2011/0...
) and other social networking sites an open call for startups to submit their pitches. By that time we decided that it was going to be 7 startup founders in the house ( 2 selected from the pitch) and include local startup
founders as well.

We had around 75 submissions and after the deadline, we announced 3
startups to participated in the  NewMe Accelerator to live in the house plus one being in ""stealth mode"" along with the local startups. We end
up selecting 3 vs two making it 8 startup founders in the house for the
summer and 5 local startups.  Post announcement:

But focusing on Gladwell is to totally miss the point.

We then raised $35M in 3 rounds, initially led by Sequoia Capital. Today the company is big and doing great, with over 70 employees and a lot of revenue.

Overall I think our initial deal was similar to other startups ($10M series A valuation). The fact that we were profitable didn't have a significant affect on funding, since we knew we needed to raise money if we wanted to expand quickly.

First, understand your community. Ask them where they hang out online. Then it's a matter of employing creative strategy that can benefit your business's bottom line while also catering to the communities where they are visiting.

A generic question like this unfortunately doesn't have a ""one size fits all"" question, but there are many ways other ways to do this. Some general ideas include:

Creative content creation around the product
Blogger outreach, especially with free products for review
Customer evangelism programs, using current customers to be brand ambassadors for your product
Engagement with customers for marketing and customer service through the channels your audience and prospects are frequently visiting.

You could go the plugin rout,e but I'm going to emphasize that you should learn about .htaccess and perhaps hide the entire entry page so that it doesn't load at all to anyone except those who have the username and password that you have provided.

As someone who has been reading Lifehacker since 2006 or so, and as someone who even was a contributing editor to Lifehacker in 2007-2008, I may have been more immersed in the Lifehacker culture; I know I have personally observed some of the more subtle shifts in Lifehacker's approach toward editorial. I strongly feel that that Gina was an incredible defining force in Lifehacker's success. Since her departure (and yet, she's still writing great articles!), there's been a great deal of amazing in-depth articles that I don't think I'd have seen just a few years ago.

Lifehacker was excellent under Gina's management and it's still thriving under Adam Pash's. It was and continues to be a really valuable resource.

Tamar-Weinberg,"Social media is a means of communication. With social media, individuals can communicate.

That said, ""social media"" as a communications channel existed online long before the term was coined. There were bulletin board services (BBS), online networks, and email has been around for a few decades. In the last few years, the Internet has given rise to more social interactions thanks to the affordability of the technology, and the name ""social media"" was born.

Communication is a basic term that encompasses social media, but I'd argue that we shouldn't get that broad. There are many ways to communicate, and this is just one.

If you've already done that or can showcase your writing skills exhaustively another way, it's a good idea to build relationships with key people at your target publication (writers and editors).

Pitch them your story idea, or better yet, pitch them the story when you think timing is right, and after you've checked if a similar post hasn't already appeared at the publication or elsewhere.

Contributors generally need to bring something unique to the table: expert thoughts or opinion, an angle about whatever topic that hasn't been talked about (much), data only you have, research only you've made, etc.

Editing is done by writers or editors, it can take a few hours to a few days, depending on the topic's timeliness and whatnot.

Contributors also generally don't get paid, but that's rarely the goal anyway, or else you'd be asking 'how to become a staff writer at a tech blog?'.

Tracy-Chou,"I set up a Github project at triketora/women-in-software-eng to crowdsource data on this subject (the data populates this spreadsheet, from which Ri Liu has built this visualization). As of April 2014, data from 149 companies has been submitted, for a total of 4700+ engineers counted. Overall, the percentage of female engineers in this data set is somewhere between 12 and 13%.

To answer the question, then:

The companies that have 1 out of 1 or 2 out of 2 female engineers technically have the highest percentages, but these are small numbers and very unstable. They just need to hire one or two men for their percentages to plummet. There's a lot of noise at the small company side of the spectrum.

At scale, the numbers start to reflect the underlying lack of diversity in tech, and it is harder to maintain higher percentages. Only counting companies with 50+ total engineers, the percentage of female engineers in the sample drops from 12.7% to 10.5%. In this set of companies, the ones that have above-average representation of female engineers are New Relic (19.87%), Rhapsody (18.42%), SurveyMonkey (17.31%), Guideware Software (17.21%), Practice Fusion (16.67%), Rdio (16.07%), Pinterest (14.39%), Quantcast (13.39%), Airbnb (13.16%), and Etsy (12.75%).

Note: People quibble quite a bit about who is considered an engineer or developer. I've gotten some flak about not counting some types of technical work as engineering (e.g. sysadmin, CSS), but the line has to be drawn somewhere. Any question like this is hard to answer ""accurately"" and to everyone's satisfaction.

Tracy-Chou,"Pinterest is a great place to work, full stop; but there are also many reasons to recommend it as a place to work as a front-end engineer:

The web product is what put Pinterest on the map and, even with the advent of mobile, is still critically important to the company as one of the major touch points with Pinners and partners. The work of front-end engineers at Pinterest is valued and has high impact.

pinterest.com is a hefty piece of engineering. We are no longer just building a website; we are building a full-featured web application, and there is a lot of complexity in that. At the platform level, we've developed a new web framework with modularity and reusability as first-class design principles, and built to consume the Pinterest API like any other client. We're still extending that framework (and the core abstractions on it), making it more powerful, performant, and easy to develop on. And of course the product itself is just really fun to build out -- features like place boards and place Pins require some pretty awesome front-end wrangling:

http://www.pinterest.com/triketora/tech-offices/

A strong company culture of ""knitting"" means product design and front-end engineers work very closely together to develop the user-facing product. And our designers are truly world-class and forward-thinking: the proliferation of the Pinterest grid layout across the modern web is just one indication of how we're pushing the field towards new standards. It's quite a privilege to work with such creative thinkers, and we really do work together. Designs aren't just set and tossed over a wall for implementation; engineers are also big stakeholders in ""putting pinners first"" (our #1 company value) and work hard to make the user experience great.

The team is phenomenal: deeply talented, with complementary strengths and backgrounds, and a dedication to collaboration and mentorship. I joined the web team at Pinterest with virtually no prior experience in web development; I couldn't have found a better team to bring me up to speed. Every pull request I submitted, I'd tag @Pinterest/web, and I'd get really helpful and insightful feedback on everything from alternate implementations with an analysis of tradeoffs, browser performance considerations, JS and CSS best practices, etc.

For those interested in exploring more full-stack work, there is also the opportunity to join full-stack product teams, doing front-end engineering for particular features but also delving into other/new technical domains. A couple of web team alums, myself included, have moved onto such teams, while retaining close ties to the web team.

Either way, it's certainly passed down over the years within the culture of NPR and public radio in general. We've always prided ourselves on a delivery that's thoughtful, deliberate and clear, while not being rushed, or academic for that matter. You also won't hear us using a lot of fancy, multi-syllable words that are more common in newspapers and magazines; we really try to write our scripts so they come across as spoken English, not written English. A lot of people who work here grew up listening to NPR, and they've worked very hard to get their own pacing just right

We also offer training to on-air staff so they can work on their delivery. There's even a book called Sound Reporting, by longtime NPR producer Jonathan Kern, that talks about on-air delivery, including how reporters and hosts make notations on paper copies of their scripts to specify when they want to emphasize a word or syllable, pause for a beat, etc.

One of the biggest goals is intimacy. On many occasions I've heard my on-air NPR colleagues say they always try to speak as if they're talking to one person who's in the room with them, rather than to an audience of millions. And that intimacy comes through in their delivery.

Trust me, it's not easy. I've been on air many times to be interviewed, and I'm always comfortable with that, but the couple of times I've taken a crack at reading a script, I failed miserably. And I'm always in awe of the hosts when I'm in the studio with them, in terms of how they can take a script and read it so naturally.

I never viewed money as being ""my money"" I always saw it as ""The money"" It's a resource. if it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system.

In other words, Cari and I are stewards of this capital. It's pooled up around us right now, but it belongs to the world. We are not perfect in applying this attitude, but we try very hard.

All that said, it turns out to be quite difficult to flush such a large sum back into the world in a way you can feel confident about, which is why we started Good Ventures (http://www.goodventures.org/) and work so closely with GiveWell. But we're learning more and more every day and accelerating our pace as we do. We intend not to have much left when we die (i.e. we have a ""burn down"" foundation).

Update: A few people have commented or sent me private messages along the lines of ""businesses can do good for the world too! don't just give it all away!"" I want to be clear that I agree 100% with that viewpoint. I personally work full time on building Asana because I agree so strongly (Solving the ultimate meta-problem at The Asana Blog). I also have many decades to invest my capital before the ""burn down"" aspect even starts to meaningfully limit the opportunities I can pursue on the business side. We've even already made one very notable investment from the foundation side of our world (Vicarious Raises $15M Led By Good Ventures To Build Software That ?Learns Like A Human?).

But I see no strong reasons to try to set up a system that perpetually invests this capital after I die, so I'd like to be rid of it before then (much like Warren Buffett). Further, even the money we grant will inevitably be re-invested in the economy somehow; it has not been ""consumed"". So, I'm just giving other people a chance to be stewards of the capital in the long run, to re-grant it or invest as they see fit.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"Based on my experience, the company size is not the most salient a factor in making the decision. It's more a question of how much you care about providing this benefit and how feasible it is to have a real kitchen where you work. I suspect the asker was trying to get at cost-effectiveness, but my guess is it is always more expensive than catering until you have hundreds of employees, and obviously it is more expensive than not providing meals at all at any scale.

Asana has had prepared meals since day 1, when Justin and I worked out of his apartment in Palo Alto. We had a part time assistant who was also a skilled chef, and she would cook us simple meals out of her kitchen. This was easy, incredibly convenient, and not very expensive.

When we moved to San Francisco, we started in an office that did not have a kitchen. Our assistant moved with us and still managed to cook pretty great meals using a combination of preparing some things at her own home and skillfully using an electric hotplate at work to finish them. By the time we were around 10 employees, this was enough work to justify our first full time chef, the incredible Donnie Thompson.

The hot plate was clearly limiting and not likely to scale, so when we were looking for our second office, having access to a kitchen was one of our top priorities. At a few places I investigated the possibility of installing a kitchen, but this was almost always prohibitively expensive at the scale we had then (hundreds of thousands of dollars up to a full million), particularly if you have to install exhaust, and most landlords weren't willing to consider it at all. At points, we felt we would need to give up and adopt catering, but we were very fortunate to find the Hamms building, which had an existing industrial kitchen on the first floor previously used by Pasta Pomodoro. The building was otherwise great and in the right price range, so we jumped on the opportunity. We've been there for 3 years already, and just signed a new 5-year lease, so this is our home for the foreseeable future.

At around 20 employees, we hired a second chef. With any operational position in a startup, I find you often need to go from 1->2 people pretty early, since it's really hard to deal with sicknesses and vacations otherwise and a team quickly becomes more than the sum of its parts for a number of reasons (energy++, bouncing ideas off each other, etc). This also enabled us to add to the quality of the service, e.g. by adding a Friday breakfast and afternoon snacks. At 60 employees, we recently hired a third full time chef to help us scale and to further improve the food service. We also have some part-time hourly members of the team who do prep work and dishwashing.

Whenever other entrepreneurs ask me about this benefit, I answer that I unequivocally feel it is worth the cost. Our food is amazing every single day and our employees greatly appreciate having it. Most will answer it is the company perk they most enjoy by a wide margin. However, I think we are very lucky to have found the Hamm's building w/ an available kitchen lease. If you are not similarly lucky, then you basically need to wait until a $300-$600k additional expense does not feel unreasonable added on to whatever office buildout you are already doing. Probably you would be 100+ employees and even then it will certainly be a big hit on your bank account.

Dustin-Moskovitz,"The single most important thing by a large margin we need to do to fight against animal cruelty is change our eating habits. Animal cruelty laws around pets are not perfect, but they are pretty good. Animal testing is not great, but the number of animals in those situations is relatively limited.

There are, however, billions of animals going through the industrial food system every year, in the US alone. If you could change the standard of care for those animals, you would be reducing animal suffering tremendously.

You can also have a meaningful impact by changing your own habits, since the average American is consuming dozens of animals per year. If you're not sensitive to how these animals are sourced, you are quite likely causing animal cruelty yourself, on a meaningfully large scale.

So, how can you fight this?
1/ Become a vegetarian or vegan.
2/ If you're an omnivore like me, care about purchasing and eating humanely raised meat. Unless you think the entire world population will switch to vegetarianism, it's critical that more omnivores eat mindfully to create a real market for this. Many terms like ""free range"" have been greenwashed and are not meaningful. I've found I need to actually know the names of the local farms that I trust to be confident. The vast vast majority of meat is not humanely raised, even by relatively low standards. Don't eat fast food at all (with rare exceptions like Chipotle, but even they aren't ideal).
3/ Again for omnivores, reduce your meat consumption. Even idyllic standards are not going to be perfect and this will help you naturally avoid the problem.
4/ Support legislation that enforces higher farming standards.

More evidence that it is not a currency:

""Actually, the question is whether anyone will actually use bitcoins to buy things at all. It's not clear why they would when its value can go from $500 to $900 in a matter of hours. Nor when so many people treat it as an inflation hedge. They think of Bitcoin more as an investment than as money. Indeed, researchers from the University of California-San Diego and George Mason University found that 64 percent of all bitcoins are being hoarded in accounts that have never been spent. And of the bitcoins that are being spent, a full 60 percent are on the gambling site Satoshi Dice."" - The Atlantic, ""Bitcoin is the Segway of Currency""

Until that changes, I think it's premature to talk about it as an alternative to the money supply and creation system in the US, or anywhere. It is much more a medium for gambling than the medium of transfer of wealth suggested in the question comments.

I generally like the idea of experimentation in markets of all kinds, so I don't want to paint the picture that I'm against bitcoin, but I don't see evidence for the optimism the question asker implies wrt solving the problems of the current banking system (or society). It's not a panacea. In fact, I think there is a serious potential to cause harm to the average American if a large chunk of the transaction market becomes opaque to the government, since it will result in tax evasion, potentially at large scale. Regardless of how I feel about individual tax laws, it is critical that they apply consistently to everyone in order to have a functioning democracy and welfare state. Moving a large part of the economy into the black market is a step towards anarchy, even if it is also a step towards freedom.

The reasons you suddenly become interested/uninterested in a topic are complicated and hard to simulate with algorithms.  You might even say it's ""AI-hard"", i.e. solvable only when true AI is solved.  Especially when the goal is to *exceed* the personal relevance achievable with existing non-personalized tools.

BTW, assuming here ""personalized news"" means an automatic news-filtering.  Of course it could mean other things too.

Lucretia-M-Pruitt,"Well, at first I felt bad because I knew I really haven't written anything worth mentioning on Quora in 2012 (not that I remember anyways.)

Then I scanned the list and thought ""Hey, those are a lot of the same people who have always been writing quality answers on Quora... I've followed them for a couple of years now.""

Then I started thinking ""I'm so not going through 500+ people to figure out who someone else thinks I should be reading when I don't even know what the criteria used was... Hmm. I should hunt down the criteria.""

Then after it settled in, I thought, 'oh honestly, it's like the damned Twitter checkmark - who cares? Either I write something useful to someone, or I don't. Doesn't make a difference whether I have a t-shirt or a plume-thingy.'

Finally I started trying to determine whether I was more in the Aesop's-Fables-Sour-Grapes mode, or the I'm-Feeling-Driven-To-Up-My-Game camp, or the I'm-Feeling-Disinclined-To-Write-More-Because-I-Hate-This-Kind-Of-Thing group..

It turns out I'm in the Groucho Marx club.

Ronald-Yau,"Another way of wording this question is, ""Is it better to get things done in high speed, or in high quality?""

Ideally, you would have both, but if you needed to sacrifice one, it depends on importance of the task which relates to the bigger picture: how does it affect the outcome of the project or goal? What are the costs, value, and risks of the approach of completing the task?
  "
Ronald-Yau,"Be Found
Create and complete your profiles on sites where most of the eyes and ears are. A few of the top ones are Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, iTunes, and MySpace. Integrate the sites together so you don?t have to do extra work. For example, when you post a new YouTube video, have it automatically post to your Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace
accounts.
Be Discovered
How are people going to discover you? One approach is creating covers on popular songs and putting them on YouTube. YouTube is the #2 search engine behind Google. People are going to search for their favorite songs and if you happen to cover one or more of them, you have a likelihood of appearing in the search results. This has been done by Just Bieber, Kina Grannis, and one of my favorite artists Mari? Digby
Be Liked
Make sure you create great content that?s worth watching, and most importantly sharing. Videos are an effective way for you to connect with your audience from a visual, audio, and emotional standpoint. While you can get away with video quality, audio quality plays a big factor.
Build Fans
Long story short, you are nothing without your  fans. Engage with those who interact with you. Sooner or later they will have a name for themselves to create a sense of belonging and connection with you. Mari? Digby has ?Digbyholics?, Kina Grannis has ?kinerds?, and Justin Bieber has ?beliebers?. Thank them for watching your videos, listening to your music, and being your fan. Make it easy for them to subscribe to you and share you with their connections. While social media sites make it easy for people to do so, it?s okay to ask, but don?t be too aggressive.
Build Ambassadors
They will sprout among your fans and they are going to be your top fans. They are passionate about you and will be more than happy o help you in their own special  ways such as creating videos, fan sites, and interviews with you. Make it easy for them to help you. Ask them what they need.
Build Street Teams
This is the next level, where you have teams of ambassadors helping you spread awareness. While this can happen naturally among themselves, you can create something for ambassadors to connect with each other online. Take a look at http://www.kinagrannis.com/stree... as an example.

Matt-Mastracci,"Moving on from DotSpots was bittersweet. We spent a few years pouring our heart into the product, which we all honestly believed would revolutionize how people consumed news. Unfortunately we underestimated how difficult it would be to get publishers to sign on and missed the window overall for success.

Another thing that's hard for me is having the great GWT-based infrastructure we built to pop up UI overtop of any webpage basically sitting idle. I'd love to open-source that one day, but it's not pressing right now. Perhaps if the right project comes along, we might be able to hand off some of it to them.

We did manage to use *some* of the DotSpots technology to bootstrap our efforts at gri.pe. The core web infrastructure for serving gri.pe pages is basically what we were going to use for serving dotspots.com.

The great part about moving on is that you have a chance to let go of all the future plans that were weighing on your mind. After a few years at a startup, you've got stuff that you've always wanted to do but never had time for. Pivoting to a new idea lets you finally let go of those in your mind.

It's also a great feeling to be working on an application that's seeing significant traction in the market. We blew by the total lifetime number of users of DotSpots within a few months! It makes you feel good seeing numbers that show people are using the application and it's making a positive impact on their lives. I would have loved for DotSpots to have a positive impact too, but it just never caught on.

In the end, it's an awesome move for us. It's still a bit sad though - like moving from a house you've lived in for years and have built memories in.

Matt-Mastracci,"I don't think the intent of the ""Learn More"" phrase is snark. I've seen this phrase used in many places where the context of the text is used as help documentation.

For instance, Google's search help has ""Learn more"" at:

http://www.google.com/support/we...

I believe that you should read the phrase ""Learn more about X"" as ""Click here for more information on X"" rather than ""You should learn more about X"".

Matt-Mastracci,"When I was young, I had the exact same experience: typing in listings from Compute! and Family Computing. I even went out and bought a few compendiums of software for additional programs to type in.

I don't have an exact analogue for Compute! magazine myself, but I think that Make Magazine serves at least some of this role for today: http://makezine.com/, at least for their embedded-development focus articles. Programming for embedded devices has something of the same feel as typing in thousands of lines of BASIC code.

I'd love to find a resource that could reproduce the feeling of typing in a simple game from a magazine, but the internet might have made typing in listings from hardcopy a thing of the past (to the world's loss).
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"Rooting an EVO 4G carries very little risk if you use the Unrevoked tool (http://unrevoked.com). The tool is designed to safely disable the security on the mobile phone and install a custom recovery to make it easier for you to move to new ROMs. I've rooted, unrooted and reflashed my EVO dozens of times without any problems while we developed the tool.

We've seen issues where people have attempted to a root a phone that isn't working properly (ie: is crashing constantly or locking up). As long as your phone is in good working order before you start, you should have no trouble.

There are disadvantages to running custom ROMs of course: the stock ROMs are built by people with access to the confidential hardware specs that open ROMs aren't able to use. The drivers for open ROMs are generally based on reverse engineering. As of today, I believe all of the hardware on the EVO is supported in open ROMs, including the troublesome WiMAX chip.

Overall, the quality of third-party ROMs is very high. You'll want to choose one that is actively maintained and has been around for a while.

Even if you choose not to run a custom ROM, I highly recommend disabling security on your device and rooting the stock ROM. This will let you run a handful of extra applications that require root (tethering apps, screenshot apps) and let you take full control over your device if you need it.
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"In the grand scheme of things if you pick a compa.ny as a domain name it doesn't really matter. Calling ourselves Gri.pe has a few advantages over Gripe: chiefly that there's a slightly smaller chance that people will try to go to gripe.com and that auto-linkifiers will make it into a link in some cases. We've had our URL mixed up in a few bits of press in the past, so we're very careful to explain ""GEE ARR EYE DOT PEE EEE"" to any press that wants to write us up.

As for the second part, we rank #1 for gri.pe and ""very highly"" for gripe (it varies based on your location).

Matt-Mastracci,"No, you can only retweet tweets from other users. Neither the API nor the UI will let you do this.

There does appear to be a number of tweets which were retweeted by their authors. One example is here:

http://twitter.com/#!/aasiain/st...

The likely explanation is that Twitter failed to validate retweets for a short period of time.

I just tried retweeting my own status from the dev console and got this:

{
  ""errors"": ""sharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)\nsharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)\nsharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)\nsharing is not permissable for this status (Share validations failed)""
}

I also tried editing the DOM of the page using old Twitter (and its private API) and was unable to retweet my status that way.

Matt-Mastracci,"You don't actually have to create a custom build. You can do this using the Chrome Extensions NPAPI functionality and call into the plugin from a background page:

http://niw.at/articles/2010/06/1...

https://code.google.com/chrome/e...

Your extension can then export an API on the window object by using content scripts. The content scripts execute JS in the context of the page to insert a brand new function on the window object. This function can use custom DOM events to send messages back to the content script, which are then passed back to the background page and into the native code.

https://code.google.com/chrome/e...

There is one disadvantage to doing things this way: you can only implement functions asynchronously. There's no way to block on a return value - you'll have to use callback functions.
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"Gri.pe was actually the idea of one of our interns, Arash Danesh. We were working on DotSpots at the time and he approached us with the idea, at the time named ""Twitrants"".

The original product was more of a tweet-mining operation: letting Twitter users use hashtags and keywords to more effectively complain about companies with Twitter accounts. We tossed the idea around for a few months and gradually morphed it into a platform where people with a complaint could visit, sign in with Twitter, find the business (even if it didn't have a Twitter account) and file it quickly.

We added Facebook logins soon after and realized that Twitrants was no longer an appropriate name. A company-wide brainstorming session yielded the lucky discovery that the domain ""gri.pe"" was available - we adopted the name that day and built the rest of the product around it.
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"One off the top of my head: The Humble Indie Bundle is a massively successful project built on AppEngine:

http://googleappengine.blogspot....

Note that we also built Gri.pe on AppEngine and I'd like to think we're at least somewhat successful (getting good press and mentions in mainstream media :)).

As for the second part of the question - I would definitely go back to AppEngine if I had an application that fit well on it.
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"This question can't be answered definitively because it depends entirely on what you are doing, how you write your code and various other factors.

We ran http://dotspots.com off EC2 and switched over to AppEngine when we moved over to http://gri.pe. At our peak with DotSpots, we were spending many thousands of dollars a month running Hadoop, our custom paragraph search engine, MySQL, MongoDB and the other various support infrastructure. We could scale our traffic up to fairly significant numbers at that levels.

Gri.pe is a much simpler product from a technical standpoint. We pay far, far less to run it than we did for DotSpots, but we don't lose much in the way of scaling.

To give you a point of reference: It costs us about 1 cent to serve my profile page (http://www.gri.pe/user/76001) 1,000 times.

Matt-Mastracci,"The jack can use the measured resistance between the different segments of the plug to determine what has been plugged in.

IDT offers a technology called ""Universal Jack"" that does what you describe:

From http://www.idt.com/products/getd...

The Universal Jack capabilities allow the CODEC to detect when audio devices are connected to the CODEC, sense the type of device (LINE_IN, LINE_OUT, MIC, Headphone) that is inserted, and to allow the CODEC to be reconfigured to support these devices wherever they are plugged into the system. SPDIF input sensing is also supported. The fully parametric IDT SoftEQ can be initiated upon headphone jack insertion and removal for protection of notebook speakers.

Here's a patent assigned to IDT that describes how it can drive the various segments in various ways. This is likely the technology behind the Universal Jack:

http://www.freepatentsonline.com...

""Nonetheless, if the right and left loads LOAD_R and LOAD_L are shorted together, then the right output RP_OUT will also be driven (indirectly) by the left amplifier 202 a . In particular, this left amplifier 202 a will drive the right output RP_OUT with the second AC measurement signal (e.g., ?18 dBv signal at 24-30 kHz). As illustrated by the cross-drive impedance sensing circuit 220 of FIG. 2, the second AC measurement signal causes an alternating current to pass from the right output RP_OUT through the resistors R_ESD_R and R_ESD_KILL and the transmission gates 210 c and 216 (TG_KD). This alternating current causes an alternating voltage to be present on the sense node PAD_SENSE, at the negative input terminal (?) of the comparator 212 and at the output COMP_OUT of the comparator 212 . The presence of an alternating square-wave voltage at the output of the comparator 212 reflects the presence of a short between the output loads and the presence of a fixed voltage (e.g., Vdd) at the output of the comparator 212 reflects a lack of a short between the output loads. The presence of the short may verify that a microphone has been plugged into the CODEC audio jack.""
  "
Matt-Mastracci,"Yep. I co-founded DotSpots in 2007 and Gri.pe last year and I still write code for personal use here and there. Most of the code I've written lately has been for Android device hacking for my hobby project, unrEVOked. If it's more than a simple script, I'll usually throw it up on Google Code or my blog for others to consume.

Matt-Mastracci,"I've attended the last two I/O conferences, once as a sandbox exhibiter and once as a speaker. It's very well run, although you'll find that many of the sessions are very popular and will fill up quickly. Plan your schedule carefully ahead of time and expect to rush from one session to another if you think the next one will be popular.

I/O runs on a number of tracks which vary from year-to-year, but are generally aligned with Google's developer technologies: Android, AppEngine, GWT, etc. Sessions in each track run throughout the day, depending on how many sessions they lined up.

There are areas scattered around the concourse for vendors to showcase their stuff built on Google technologies. If you are interested in a particular technology, they are usually developers manning the booth that are more than willing to discuss their experiences.

Last year's evening activities were held upstairs in a large area. There was an amazing video/music montage playing about the room. There were a bunch of neat demos around - including the mechanical walking spider from burning man and a high-speed camera. It's a good time to mingle, but it was too loud for me to hear much.

There's always snacks in the main concourse and lunch is served in a large room, so there's never a real rush to grab something to eat around then. The evening activities tend to be a little more chaotic for food, but you don't need to wait that long.

It actually turns out that the storage device fails to report that the writes failed and Linux continues to show the old information in its page cache. If you flush the caches or wait long enough, the modifications you made to the device will disappear.

In this case, neither T-Mobile nor HTC are fighting back any harder than they do on any other device.

As for why manufacturers don't allow root at all, this is a much tougher question. I believe that carriers are used to having total control over the telecom experience and, as such, don't see any benefit to giving users the ability to modify their devices. In fact, allowing users to install any software may hurt the revenue they see from charging users to tether via wifi to their device, something which can be done for free on a rooted device.

Our goal has always been to automate the process where a legitimate user has an unresolved complaint with a company, takes it to their social network and gets a big enough audience that the company notices and fixes the problem.

One of the checks we use in our system is your real identity. You link your gri.pe account to your real-life Facebook and Twitter accounts to take advantage of the networks you've built organically. Would you blackmail or unfairly harass a small business owner using your real name, in front of all your friends and family?

As an aside: we've been surprised at how many ""cheers"" (the positive equivalent of a gripe) have been filed in our system as well. Our users continue to surprise us by filing an almost even number of positive and negative statements about business they've interacted with, even though our product is clearly aimed at capturing and resolving their complaints.

Edward-Boches,"I get asked a lot how it is that Mullen transformed itself over the last couple of years, evolving from a ?traditional? ad agency into a firm that blends digital, social, media, creative, mobile and DR in a way that actually works, albeit with a bit of occasional tension and pain.

Here are what I believe has worked for us:

A philosophy summed up in a single word:  Unbound

It was at an offsite a few years ago when our management team challenged itself to re-invent the company for a future filled with all kinds of changes ? technology, social media, consumer behavior.  We came up with the word Unbound to declare that we would not be restricted by our past, by the conventions of advertising,  or even by our current skill set.  Instead we would embrace ? even more aggressively than we already had ? the idea that the answer to how we build a client?s business wasn?t necessarily advertising. It might be a new product, or the way we gather a community, or how we construct new tools, apps and platforms.

An obvious emphasis on talent

We made an aggressive investment in new talent and got out of their
way. We brought in a new ECD, now CCO.  We hired a new leader for our
account group. We added experience in our analytics group. We also
created bigger opportunities for our existing stars. One of our key criteria was how hungry they were. Those of us who?d built the company from a small regional boutique into a national agency knew how far determination and passion can take a company. We wanted the same qualities in the next generation of leaders.

A relentless focus on the work

It should go without saying, but the fact is that everything from deadlines to approvals to expediency can get in the way of a relentless focus on great work. But Mark Wenneker, the agency?s creative leader, has taken the work up more than a few notches and more importantly gotten the entire company aligned with the mission.  We?re not where we ideally want to be, but anyone who?s any good never is.  The fact that creativity, in all of its manifestations, has the organization?s collective attention is likely to yield even better work in the coming year.

A willingness to push responsibility down

Mullen has always prided itself on a culture of ?collective entrepreneurialism,? an oxymoron I coined years ago to describe our culture. When you?re a small company it?s a lot easier to recruit people who share the same mindset.  The best way to find out of folks still have that quality is to give them rights and responsibility then hold them to it.  The best people want that, even demand it, and the benefits to both clients and the agency are quickly apparent.

An environment that forces collisions

I can?t put enough emphasis on this. When we moved to Boston we  intentionally designed an open environment that forced people to crash into each other. More importantly, despite three floors and multiple  departments, we embedded a broad range of capabilities in the creative group, including social, connection planning, mobile, tech, UX, digital design and production.  It helped foster a new kind of team, more diverse working sessions and an increased respect and understanding for every discipline.

A openness to experimentation

Finally, we made a commitment to trying more things for ourselves, in anticipation of client needs. John Moore, our media chief, built an emerging media lab and filled it with every new gadget, technology and platform. We created projects and reasons for everyone in the company to embrace social media, conceiving Brand Bowl (originally Trash Talk from the Twitter Section, which introduced much of the advertising industry to Twitter), turning our own site into a blog open to all employees, and experimenting with crowdsourcing.

Some of the best investors in Silicon Valley are not very well known. They work behind the scenes, don't generate excessive PR for their firms, and don't speak on behalf of their portfolio companies, letting the founders do the talking instead. Sigma matches this profile: they are very focused on building great relationships with their founders and generating IRR for their LPs, not on landing the next speaking gig at a conference.

And, like many of the best VCs, each team member has extensive operating experience, both at startups and at big companies. They have high loyalty from their portfolio (as evidenced by the other answers here) because of this.

You can also look at their portfolio: oDesk (near-term IPO candidate), Responsys (recent IPO then Oracle acquisition), EqualLogic (largest venture-backed acquisition of 2007, at $1.6B), Postini ($625M Google acquisition), Strava, SugarSync, Demandbase, and many others.

On July 16, 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope Gregory IX (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, friend of St Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. He was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His burial place remained unknown until it was discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for his remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of St. Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by Pope Paul VI, and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.

Michael-Wolfe,"For a technology company like Vicarious the major expenses are always people.

For each person you have on staff, you have to account for:
Salary - probably averaging $120-$150K for the kinds of highly qualified engineers and researchers that make up much of their staff. Even more for executives, senior sales reps, and others.
Payroll taxes, social security taxes, short term and long term disability insurance, healthcare - add another 30% or so to salary.
Recruiting costs - easily $20-30K per head.
Facilities - you need a place for all of these great people to work, plus furniture, kitchen, reception, etc.
Equipment and software - those Macbooks and monitors add up, as do the 10+ Saas subscriptions per employee you probably pay for.
Training, career development, perks - good companies invest in developing their employees and keeping them happy.
Travel and expenses.

This means that in Silicon Valley, it costs you at least $200K per year for a qualified, senior staff, fully loaded. It can even be higher - at my last company we budgeted $250K per head since had enterprise sales reps with large commissions that travelled a lot.

The net is this: five fully-loaded, qualified staff costs you a million dollars per year.

So $40M gets your 200 person years. This means:
200 people for one year.
100 people for two years.
66 people for three years.
50 people for four years.

(I apologize for being so pedantic, but I'm amazed at the number of people who will challenge numbers like these with, ""it can't be that expensive"").

I don't know how many people Vicarious has - a quick LinkedIn search says they have at least 30 or so.

If they want to grow their staff by a bit and give themselves a few years to develop the technology plus a cushion, they can go through $40M no problem.

  "
Michael-Wolfe,"I'll answer your question, but I'll take some liberties to answer what I think the *real* question is.

Investors can ask for whatever they want. You are free to say yes or no. They would typically ask for things like:
Founder vesting - you should want this, too. If you don't have it, put it in place before you raise money.
Employee pool - they will push to raise the size of the option pool. They want to make sure you have enough equity to build a great team, plus raising the pool effectively raises their post-money percentage ownership.
Revesting - in some cases, if the founders are already substantially vested, new investors might ask you to ""revest"" some of your shares to ensure you stay around. This is negotiable.
And all investors will take a key interest in the founding team. They'll invest based on the quality of the team, how many of the key roles your team has covered, and how well you seem to work together. They'll probably eyeball the equity distribution to see if it passes the sniff test.

But asking founders to redistribute their stakes? I'm sure it has happened - everything under the sun has. But it is not common. If investors thought that a founder was this weak, and if the investor thought you lacked the strong co-founder relationship required to get the stakes right between yourselves before they came along, that investor would be unlikely to invest in the first place.

But forget the investors - they don't run your company. You do. The bigger issue here seems that you have a problem within your founding team. You need to solve it, and you should not wait until some investor comes along and forces the issue.

Your co-founder is acting very strange in the following ways:
He is taking something that is unlikely to happen and telling you that it is likely to occur.
By telling you that ""investors will all think you have too much,"" your co-founder is telling you that *he* thinks you have too much. Why would he raise the issue otherwise?
He is telling you that if he gets this request, he'll cave in vs. negotiating or finding different investors.

This doesn't sound to me like someone who is happy with the amount of equity that you have. He might not be happy with you at all. And he may have good reason - I have no way of knowing.

What he should do is sit down with you face to face, share his concerns, then either renegotiate your position or ask you to leave. But he is not willing to do that. Instead he is going ""blame it on the investors"" once those investors come along and supposedly agree with his assessment of your stake. This is a very convoluted and backwards way to avoid a difficult discussion.

If true, this shows a real lack of integrity and the management courage required to have difficult conversations. Blaming decisions on ""the board"" or ""the investors"" is a sign of weak management. Blaming them before it has even happened is worse.

When you start a company, you always should do this:
Agree between yourselves how you want to split equity and responsibility between the founding team. Read the first few chapter of http://www.amazon.com/The-Founde... for a great discussion on the topic. Part ways if you can't come to terms.
Decide what new talent you need on the team and propose an option pool to cover it.
Get your pitch and story nailed.
Then go to investors with a united front, negotiate for what you want, and get it.

Expecting investors to intervene and help you hash out important issues within your team is a very poor strategy. I'd recommend that *before* investors get tangled up in this, sit down with your co-founder. You need to talk about
Does he think your equity stake is correct?
If so, why does he think investors won't?
If so, will he stick up for you if the issue does come up?
Does he have concerns about your performance? It he regretting working with you?

This is purely a conversation between the founders. It has nothing to do with investors.

If you don't get this settled, you'll suffer a founder breakup later (very common), and the company will suffer regardless of the investors.

You have an idea you are knowledgeable and passionate about.
You have great co-founders who work together well.
You are determined to get your idea into the market since it is something you want to exist in the world.

I don't read any of that into your question for the following reasons:
You mention ""for the experience of doing it"" as a reason to start a company. That is a very poor reason.
You mention ""for the title"" as a reason to start a company. This is an even worse reason.
Just the fact you are asking the question means that you haven't really discovered an idea and team you are passionate about, otherwise this wouldn't be a dilemma for you.

I'd recommend taking a job at an early stage startup, learning all you can, and only start your own company when you are truly ready.

Michael-Wolfe,"I'd recommend taking your emphasis off of the title. No, titles are not meaningless, but focusing on them tends to blind you to the things that really matter. A focus on title can cause you to make a bad decision which will not only make you unhappy, but which could set your career back far more than picking the ""wrong"" title.

So, don't worry about what you *call* the job, worry about whether you want to *do* the job.

Do you have a great idea for a company, great co-founders, and are eager to get going? If so, start a company.

Or, do you really love this company that is bringing you on as a VP? Do you think you can be successful, the company can be successful, and you are looking forward to working there? If so, join.

Pick the role that you are passionate about and where you can succeed. If you do good work and build a strong network of people who want to work with you again, that will move your career forward far more than one title or the other.

Michael-Wolfe,"I'll defer to Jason M. Lemkin's great answer on the question of how to manage and pay the sales team and comp plan - his experience matches mine.

At my companies we did not cap our reps. We had our best rep make $1.1M one year. And guess what? The engineers, as well as everyone else from the board on down, were ecstatic. The > $8M in revenue that the rep brought in was one of the inflection points that put our company on the map. The $1M we paid him brought in $7M of cash plus probably raised our market cap by $50M. Does that sound like a good investment?

The engineering team was happy because they all had stock in the company, were focused on the revenue goal, and loved watching the deals close. Many even helped work on problematic deals. Many of the ""heroes"" at the company were the best reps, many of whom made well more than $500K in their best years.

Which gets me to perhaps the more important point: you may have a poor or inexperienced management team. When I hear things like, ""they are afraid the engineers will get upset,"" it is a red flag to me - it almost always predicts weak management.

You really have a management team who is going to put your top line at risk because it will ""feel unfair""? This feels to me like a management team who:
Assumes that your employees will not be aligned with the goals of the company - either your managers don't plan to give them stock options, or they don't plan to hire engineers who are motived by the success of the business and the value of their options.
Assumes your employees are not adults and aren't savvy enough to know that different roles have different comp structures.
Is not aware of the market for great sales talent. Instead of looking at where the best reps are, how they get paid, and what they have to pay to get them on your team, they are using some arbitrary internal measure of ""fairness"" to set comp levels below market. You can't do that: the market sets the comp you need to pay the best people. You don't.
Isn't 100% focused on crushing revenue but is instead going to try shortcuts and half measures to win in the market. They may screw around for a couple of years trying to get reps to agree to lame comp plans, and by then the market will have been won or lost (probably won by someone who didn't do that).

So, even if you negotiate to raise or remove the cap, I'd look a lot closer at the management team and ask if you are on a winning team.
  "
Michael-Wolfe,"There are a set of grifters who hang around the startup industry like flies around honey who try to take advantage of young founders. Your ""friend"" is one of them.

Introductions to investors happen for free - period. They are done by people who want to help the company and help the investors and believe they will get ""paid"" through increased goodwill from both sides.

I make dozens of these introductions, and everyone I know does, too. They *never* ask for compensation for them.

But if someone wants to help the company and get involved in an ongoing basis, you may add him to your advisory board along with a small equity grant (typically around 0.25%), but this not direct ""payment"" for introductions. This is for ongoing help in his area of expertise.

Regardless, the question is somewhat moot for two reasons:
As Casey Allen pointed out, it is likely illegal anyway.
You'd have to disclose this to the new investor as well as any future investors, and most would walk away from the investment, not wanting to deal with a company with naive founders and 10% dead equity.

Michael-Wolfe,"Product management is a great background to start a tech company, and many tech companies have been started by product managers.

Product management is actually the closest job description to a startup CEO. In both jobs, your time is spent:
Interviewing customers and understanding their needs.
Working with engineering and designers to build the product.
Pitching the product to customers and partners.
Testing and optimizing pricing and distribution.

That being said, some rather large caveats:

Many product managers at large companies have never really done the job as I described it. Many are simply go-betweens from customers to engineers. They generate spreadsheets of feature requests and beg engineering to build them, but they have few opportunities to truly be the ""CEO"" of their product.
Many product managers have not worked on truly new products and markets - they may have only worked on products they inherited. They were not there when the initial vision of the product was developed and tested. This requires overlapping, but different skills. (See anything written by Steve Blank on ""Customer Development"" for examples).
People management skills are just as important as product management skills for founders. They need to be able to bring in and manage a strong team, as well as manage the product discovery process.
I'd never recommend anyone make a career decision based on ""what will best set me up to start a company?"" Do what you love and are good at - not only will you have more fun, you'll be more likely to succeed.
Startups founders are somewhat sui generis - each came via their own, unique, path. Although many do come from engineering or product management backgrounds, the best ones seem to have an ""X factor"" that transcends skill in any one area. I'd never predict that simply being a good product manager would make someone a good founder, nor would I discourage someone who hasn't been a product manager.

Which is all a long way of saying that, although product management skills are valuable, I'm not sure that information is really actionable. If you think you are ready to start a company and are passionate about it, do it. If not, don't.

Michael-Wolfe,"Why aren't there more successful sites? The answer is simple: there are only 24 hours in a day.

Although the number of internet users is large (over 2 billion) and rising, and the number of hours per day spent online is rising, there are still only a finite number of hours in the day for users to spend with their favorite sites. Thus only a finite number of internet products and services can generate a large amount of usage at a given time.

This is the same reason why there are a relatively fixed number of hit movies and TV shows in a given year. People have a finite amount of time and dollars.

In addition, network effects businesses (like Facebook), further narrow the number of winners in a given market since the bulk of usage clusters around a few winners.

So the better question is not ""why aren't there more Facebooks?"" but ""why was Facebook the winner in their market?""

This has already been covered elsewhere, but possible answers are:
Team - Mark and his co-founders were incredible. They have continued to bring in incredible folks like Sheryl Sandberg.
Timing - 2003 turned out to be a perfect time to start a social network.
Launch strategy - starting with a single school, then multiple schools, then expanding outside of schools was a great strategy.
Design - the site has already been very well designed, and the company has made consistently good product choices.

Yes were 10's of thousand of programmers in the world with the skill to build Facebook 1.0, very few of them were working on social networks in 2003. At the time Facebook started, there were probably fewer than 100 teams seriously working on social networks.

A social business is an organization designed consciously around sociality and social tools, as a response to a changed world and the emergence of the social web, including social media, social networks, and a long list of other advances.

Enterprise 2.0 is generally used to represent the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies -- like cloud computing, social media, wikis, and the like -- and is, as such, principally a technology adoption issue, and not a reconceptualization of business operations.

Stowe-Boyd,"Let's start by agreeing that the 2.0 meme has been played out.

I suggest we refer to these modern collaboration tools as work media: social tools designed for the enterprise but based on the patterns of interaction, influence, and communication from social networks of the open web.  Work media  tools  share a number of characteristics, most  centrally the streaming  metaphor  of Twitter and Facebook, with short updates from a variety of followed sources cascade into each user's dashboard, from which each can derive a networked gestalt of the world. Work media is altering the DNA of business.

The transition to liquid media -- where content is contextualized within streaming apps like Twitter, Flipboard, and News.me, instead of on web pages -- is not a fad. It is the next cycle of a fundamental transition into social media, and one that is moving past the superficial, earlier adoption and into a deeply socialized experience of information flow, based on social networks, not just alternative, low-cost publishing solutions.

And yes, this is a movement away from business processes as the primary metaphor of business operations in hierarchically organized companies, over to social network-based work and social network-organized companies. This is much more than a shift in scale, and very pragmatically, it is a shift to a way of work that is very well fitted to the time we are living in.

The adoption of work media in business will be profoundly transformative, and not just because of the shiny toys -- like tablets, and truly smart phones -- that are arriving at exactly the same time.

There are strong cognitive reasons that people naturally are adopting a stream/networked model of work communities. There are numerous studies (Meade, and many more recently) that demonstrate that people are happier and more productive, for example, when they share their immediate tasks and receive acknowledgment of progress made. In such settings, we perceive time moving faster, and the effort involved in work seems less. (See my writing on 'social cognition' for more on this.)

To the extent that we are capable of getting to a flow state in our work, it seems clear that the best tools are those structured according to the patterns of human interaction present when teams 'flow': helping us to keep relevant information in close context, to coordinate with team members, and for all to know what needs to be accomplished by who, for example. This requires tools in which we, those doing the work, are the principal sources of information, the principal sources of meaning: not the information we are exchanging, or even the company on whose behalf we are exchanging it.

Today, companies need solutions that foster trust in an increasingly free agent world, and especially the 'swift trust' that is necessary for short-term teams to come together quickly, accomplish a shared task, and then move on.

We need liquid media to deal with an increasingly slippery, uncertain world, and to -- paradoxically -- help ground us by keeping our heads above the churning surface exactly where the flow is at its fastest.

Ten years from now, we will have a strange sensation when we think about how work was accomplished 'in the old days.' We will look back on the work environment of the '00s and earlier, and wonder: how did we ever get anything done when our tools got in the way and divided us from ourselves?

Stowe-Boyd,"Like most systems based on gaming, it will turn out to be a fad, unless there are complex strategic elements of the game (like chess, go, bridge, or WoW).

  "
Stowe-Boyd,"Meade and other researchers have shown that setting goals and noting progress made, people were happier, sensed time passing faster, and were more productive. As Robert Levin said in A Geography Of Time, ""Psychologists and planners have sometimes used the ?time flies? phenomenon to their advantage. In one project, for example, psychologist Robert Meade was able to improve workers? morale by speeding up the psychological clock. Meade took advantage of the fact that that time is experienced as shorter when people believe that they are making progress toward a goal. The sense of progress, he found, can be enhanced through simple procedures such as establishing a definite end point to the task and providing incentives to reach those goals.""

Socializing these activities through the use of streaming collaboration tools is an obvious approach (see Surrender To The Stream And Be Happy http://d.pr/cMSU ).

Stowe-Boyd,"I think the web is having a strong impact on spirituality, and in a way that accords with disruptions it has engendered elsewhere.

In the long run, the web will favor decentralization of spirituality, away from dogmatic and exclusionary creeds. And just as the web allows -- and supports -- the dynamism of many views on any sphere of human interaction, we will see the reemergence of enigmatic spirituality -- where we confront the unknowable and transcendent -- and the decline of dogmatic and formal religions.

Stowe-Boyd,"Google needs to think about the next stage of the social revolution, not the last one (the one they sat out).

The next stage is the rise of the social operating system, where social connection is managed intrinsically, like today's operating environment's handle files, programs, and network connections.

What we have learned from the open social web is that it's all about people: people following each other; communicating; sending pictures, invitations, and love notes. We invented the web to happen to ourselves, not to create content.

So Google should push ahead with Android (and drop Chrome OS), building in the primitives that implement sociality. Then, they and other application developers can build on top of a social platform that is distributed, open, and not under the control of a single company. Our social metadata would reside on our hard drives (and cached in the cloud), controlled by us, not in the data farms owned by Facebook.

Yes, Twitter would be a great acquisition for Google in this regard, although they would have to rearchitect it to be a distributed, open solution, although with a very similar user experience to today's.

Instead of scrambling to build social apps, Google could be the first to lay a foundation for the social world.

PS But I bet it will be Apple, since their history of integrating operating environment, devices, and applications together is much, much more compelling.

Stowe-Boyd,"Flipboard is perhaps the defining iPad app of the present, and in their niche -- the social magazine -- they command the visionary high ground. There will be a huge competition for that space, and a wide variety of competitors, including traditional publishers like NYTimes, Wired, etc., crossovers like Branson's Project magazine, and many, many upstarts like Flipboard.

I expect that Twitter's ambitions in making its own client software suggests they will -- sooner or later -- take a run at the social magazine niche, once the potential is really obvious. Perhaps an acquisition of Flipboard? Facebook could also build a tablet format social magazine, and drowning in cash, why wouldn't they?

Google should wade in immediately, since meaning is the new search: we will rely on our social connections to deliver meaningful insights to us instead of relying on search engines' indexing to find clues. But Google's social deafness has hampered them for years, so they will likely dither until the metaphor of social magazine has been well-established, and then they will build a sketchy knock-off using three people's 20% time, wait a few months and shut it down, and then acquire two social magazine start-ups for $50M, wait two years and then shut them down. Then one of the founders of one of those start-ups will build a great social magazine product, which will be acquired by AOL.

Stowe-Boyd,"I never warmed to Friendfeed, primarily because it seemed dominated by outsized personalities and their acolytes. As I wrote in Jan 2009 in Bottom Feeding Off Friendfeed (http://www.stoweboyd.com/post/82...
It may also be that the benefits of Friendfeed only accrue to very popular people ? like Gray and Scoble ? who have dozens or hundreds of acolytes who respond to their every post with a barrage of commentary. I will also suggest that those who are very active followers of those two and their ilk may also get a secondary, real and significant benefit as well. But the average schmoe, wandering around in Friendfeedland, having not perfected either massive social popularity or the followership model will try the service out and quickly leave never to return because there is no ?it? to get for them. There is no there there, as Gertrude Stein famously said of Oakland.

The difference with Quora seems to be the thematic approach. Instead of personalities dominating, in Quora issues dominate. This has the direct effect of drawing deeply knowledgeable people to jump into Quora discussions -- like having the founder of a startup answer questions about the company -- which reminds me of the Woody Allen bit from Annie Hall, when he's drawn into a discussion with a bombastic idiot at a cocktail party about Marshall McLuhan, and Allen pulls McLuhan out of thin air to refute the blowhard.
The dominant motif in Quora is the spirit of inquiry, a direct rejection of being a fan boy of highly popular media personalities. Quora is less like talk radio, where Howard Stern holds court on a dozen topics each show, and much more like reading -- and participating with -- the New Yorker or the Atlantic, where a diverse set of leading thinkers address the issues of the day.

Jennifer-Van-Grove,"Ben did a great job of answering that question, so here are my additional thoughts on the subject matter.

If you don't have the connections, your best bet is to send an email pitch to the right reporter (see Ben's point on knowing who to pitch).

The number of cold email pitches I receive far outnumbers the vetted-through-trusted-contacts ones. I don't treat each equally, but I will read each and every one (at least partially).

Here are some dos and don'ts on email pitches:

Your first few paragraphs should not be used to tell me how much you enjoy reading my work, that we may have crossed paths two years ago, that you're like X popular startup but for X industry, or that you think this is a great story idea for Mashable. Get to the point within the first few sentences.
Tell me what type of coverage you're looking for (launch, funding, new feature release etc) and for when (also good to put this in the subject line). Is there an embargo? Is this an exclusive? etc.
It's okay to pitch your startup when there isn't any specific news -- say for instance you launched six months ago and Mashable has yet to cover you. I will likely point you to our Bizspark series for profiling new startups and you can submit an application for consideration. I usually look through these 2 - 3 times a week, but emailing me directly to let me know you've submitted an application may help you cut the line.
Asking me to give you feedback on a site as a roundabout way to get my interest doesn't work. The average news day is a whirlwind affair of email, phone calls, demos and, of course, writing. I don't have time to look at your site and give you feedback (unless we're friends).
If I think your startup is worth a story, I'll either star it/label it and come back to it, tell you to submit to the Bizspark series, forward it to a colleague more suited for the story or pick it up immediately and follow up with you via phone or email for more on the backstory.
I will write up startups that have been picked up by other outlets, but linking to your New York Times or TechCrunch writeup when you're pitching me doesn't win you any bonus points. I want an original story, not an also-ran.
I have different expectations around pitches from PR people and ones from founders. I don't expect a founder to have a polished pitch and that's okay. I do expect tangible passion for their product and vision. I expect a more formulaic/seasoned pitch from a PR person.
You could break all the ""rules,"" but if you have a killer product, I will pick up the story.

It's not an if, then situation where if you have 10MM users then you're mainstream. I'd argue it's less about numbers and more about whether the app or web service is being regularly talked about in circles beyond the tech niche. I'd also argue that once the media starts to run exposes or editorials on the downsides of X, then you're dealing with something that is verging on ""mainstream.""

Christine-Lu,"The short answer is:

How the China promo video is generally viewed in America depends on who is viewing the China promo video in America.

If we're talking Americans, then it'll be interesting to hear the diverse points of view on this answer. Some will see it as a tourist promo video. Others may see it as China being in our face about being a rising power. And many will have a bunch of stuff in between.

The not so short answer is:

I personally don't think this promo video was made for an American point of view to begin with. Who aside from Yao Ming do most Americans recognize in that clip? If it was made for Americans, they would have included a lot more cliches to make us feel warm and fuzzy about visiting China. Panda bears, the Great Wall of China, smiling Chinese kids saying hello on camera and telling us to visit. You know, stuff like that. But this wasn't that kind of promo video.

When you factor in the timing and place of where the promo video debuted, I would say influencing Americans to visit China or think more positively of China came second to projecting China's ""soft power"" in America and giving the Chinese a lot of international ""face"" in the process.

The promo video debuted the same week that Hu Jintao was in the U.S. for an official state visit. Even though New York wasn't one Hu's stops, it is where the mainstream media is headquartered. Given the amount of attention that was already focused on China that week, this promo video in Times Square was another opportunity for media to talk about China's ""rising influence on the international stage"" during Hu's visit -- giving the Chinese lots of international face.

The promo video was covered in Chinese media during the week of Hu's visit also. This includes segments by Chinese media at Times Square interviewing Americans and international tourists about what they thought about the promo video. Being the polite westerners we are, when a Chinese film crew asks us what we think about a Chinese promo video, we're going to say nice things about China (even if most of us don't know who the heck any of those people are besides Yao Ming) and those nice things we say about China are going to end up being aired in Chinese media -- giving the Chinese lots of international face.

This last point is one that the mainstream media overlooked. The promo clip is set to play 300 times a day straight through Valentine's Day. Which also means it's going to play straight through the Chinese New Year. Since New York City is a popular destination for mainland Chinese tourists during Chinese New Year, get ready for groups of Chinese tourists taking pictures and videos in Times Square the next few weeks with that promo clip of China in the background. This is an excellent way for China to project China's image in front of Chinese citizens visiting the U.S. --  giving the Chinese lots of international face.

Farhad-Mohit,"Originally the question was: Explain Burning Man in layman's terms.
Please, keep that in mind when reading my answer... :)

I would say that Burning Man is weeklong gathering in the desert where a bunch of people consciously go about ""burning"" (or getting rid of) the default set of assumptions about how the world has to be, as told to us by the (mostly western) MAN -- capitalistic, competitive, scarcity-based, hierarchical, judgmental, dogmatic, etc. -- and seeing what happens.

So, it's a week-long gathering of people who are interested in exploring a world which is about individuals producing instead of masses consuming; of people creating something of direct value to their community rather than doing whatever it takes to be able to buy stuff off a shelf that has little intrinsic value, but comes with a silly brand or logo on it.

It is a week of turning your fantasies and your imagination into reality rather than passively consuming a manufactured image that predictable advertisements try to brainwash you into believing is the only reality possible.

Burning Man is a place where accepting your and others' uniqueness, freedom of expression and right to do whatever you want (as long as it doesn't violate anyone elses rights) is highly valued.  So, in a fundamental way, it's a place that inspires people to participate instead of to spectate, to suspend fixed judgement about what is right and wrong, and to instead become immersed in the field of infinite possibilities.

The weird bits (sex, drugs, rock and roll, outrageous outfits, camps, art work, etc.) all derive from a combination of the above which results in a celebration of our collective individuality and uniqueness, instead of adhering to a socially coerced, manufactured, branded, homogenous set of norms that one institution or another (companies, governments, religions) are forcing down people's gullets in order to control them and keep them in line.

hmm... As I read the above, I see that it doesn't really do a good job of answering the question in layman's terms...  but, I guess, Burning Man is not for the laymen anyway...

It's a place for the playmen of the the highest order -- the crazy ones who believe in their god-like power to shape a reality where the purpose of life is to give and experience as much joy and freedom as possible!

Farhad-Mohit,"I've had some success in Los Angeles.  BizRate was in Marina del Rey, Shopzilla in West Los Angeles.  Flipagram is in Culver City and as we expand, we're thinking about West Hollywood.

That said, I will never again locate my start-up west of the 405! No chance, no way, no how!  So Culver City 100% over Santa Monica.

Because I'll tell you something: the biggest fraud sprung upon the rookie entrepreneur in L.A. is this stupidity known as ""Silicon Beach."" 

Calling ""west of the 405"" ""Silicon Beach"",  is akin to the naming the Department of War, The Department of Defense. Sure it makes sound like a good idea, but it doesn't make it a good idea.

You see, every Angeleno knows that the lamest thing about Los Angeles is not the vacuous stares of the fit-and-brainless folks in the ""industry,"" it's the god-awful traffic.  That makes the center of evil in L.A. the 405 freeway.  So all your moves need to consider this evil vein running through the city.

With that in mind, I feel that putting your startup west of the 405 is what the devil would do if he had control of your destiny, because that assures misery for the 80%+ of your people who invariably live east of the 405.  No amount of hypothetical biking on the beach or rubbing elbows with fellow nerds stuck in the same predicament will make up for that soul-draining commute every morning.

And no, you won't be playing beach volley-ball with the snapchatters every afternoon, because, like you, they're sitting in front of their glowing screens biding their time and waiting for the 405 traffic to die down before they can start their dreaded commute home. :)

Ryan-Sarver,"On the Twitter Platform team, we think of this in a few ways:

It's the joining of two, totally complementary platforms. One is a vertically integrated mobile OS, the other a horizontal social platform. There are around 200M iOS devices sold and Twitter has around 200M users, so there are huge opportunities for developers when combining the two user bases.

Lots of value for developers with very little code. Apple abstracts away the difficult parts, like doing OAuth signing and managing permissions/identity. We think developers will find the most value in:
Instant Personalization - One-click, instantly personalized experiences for users. Identity, single sign-on and social graph can be combined to create a really powerful, personalized and deeply social experience with little code.
Distribution / User Acquisition - Twitter is a great distribution channel. Tons of apps like Foursquare, Instagram and Quora have benefited from its effects and we think more iOS apps will learn to use it for that. Quora recently said they see, on average, 30 clicks back for every tweet a user sends from their thread pages. That's incredible traffic and leads to lots of new users and page views. This will translate to app downloads on iOS. We think it has the potential to be the second largest driver of app downloads next to the App Store.
  "
Ryan-Sarver,"As Zac says, it's more about the contract we have with the user. They entrust us with their content and we need to be good shepherds of that.

In order to do that, we need to have a direct relationship with developers and partners who are consuming Twitter content via the API to make sure they are playing by the rules -- and if they aren't, we need the ability to shut them off.

Jason-Keath,"Killing another person should be done when there are a lack of all other options to prevent the death of others. War falls into this column (sometimes). Self defense as well.

The Death Penalty is a Punihsment
The death penalty is enforced not to defend life, not to prevent future crime, and not for the betterment of society as a whole (as many have quoted it's failure as a deterrent), but rather, it is used to satisfy the personal (and very internal) desire of individuals to punish another individual for their pain, sorry, guilt, sadness, and outrage.

If the death penalty was used to protect society as a whole, it would potentially hold more merit. The government exist to protect it's citizens. But instead it serves only those individuals who wish revenge, retribution, and emotional ""closure"" to a wound caused by the worst criminals in our system.

The Death Penalty Devalues Life
Our view of whether the death penalty is a positive benefit to society actually comes down to how much we value other people in our society, it correlates strongly with how much we value the life of those we do not know, in fact the life of people we may not even appreciate, value, acknowledge.

Liberals have a stronger believe that we should support each other, be each other's keeper. That we should rehabilitate criminals more to than penalize them. Over very penal system is named so because it focuses on punishment and separation from society than it does on improving the moral character of criminals and improving their ability to contribute to society.

Consider where most executions in the US take place. 13 southern states have conducted 73% of all executions since the ban was lifted in 1976.


(US executions since 1976, source: Death penalty in the US mapped)

These are of course the same states it where it was at one time ""normal"" for slaves to be executed. Many of these states such as North Carolina and Virginia had so called Black Codes (United States) which were basically stronger death penalty laws for blacks compared to white. At one point in Virginia there were 5 crimes that a white man could be executed for and 70 that a black man could be sentenced to the death penalty for. Clearly slavery taught much of the south to value blacks less than their own race.

(Caveat, half of southern executions come from Texas. Many of the causes of a high number of executions are magnified in Texas where elected judges have to be hard on crime, the legal system in general is less ""fair"" to violent offenders, and the population is very high)

I would argue that slavery's devaluing of life has continued til today. Our morals and ethics and outlooks on like come get passed along through nurturing, for better or worse.

When You Devalue Life, You Devalue Society As A Whole
If you truly view life as precious, as the most precious thing we have and will ever have, creating scenarios or reasons for why another person's life should be taken away becomes a very short list. But if you value certain people's lives less than others, you can more easily believe that the death penalty is a useful penalty. We all do this to some extent. Many would for instance sacrifice the life of someone they don't know for someone they love, forced to choose. But a mindset of devaluing those that are poor, a different race, a different religion, etc. can allow us to be more comfortable making decisions about the taking of the lives of others.

This does not mean if you believe in the death penalty you are a bigot or racist or ignorant in any way. Many whites get executed in southern states after all.

Why Liberals?
To get back to the question.

Why are liberals generally opposed to the death penalty?

Because liberals believe in a social contract ? that everyone has a right to life, liberty and property (not slavery). And that a central authority is required to maintain those rights to all. In our natural state, humans retract to self-preservation as goal number one, despite any cost to others on many levels. In general, liberals fight for the welfare of all people and an equality that would not exist without a central authority or government to protect it.

That right to life, that protection of equality is driven by a believe of valuing all people in the society and helping them not only gain and protect certain natural rights, but also an ability to understand humans are flawed. Humans make mistakes. There is a larger belief in rehabilitation and forgiveness amongst liberals.

Liberals also look at the poorest in society as being disadvantaged at no fault of their own. Conservatives believe, to a higher degree, that anyone in society can transcend whatever environment they are born into, for better or worse.

If you fight for the wellbeing of society as a whole, then you also fight to correct the flaws in that society. If you for the rights of the individual above the rights of the society then you may be more inclined to support the death penalty as a more selfish act.

This is not to say that conservatives do not care about other people and that liberals are better people. These believes are built over lifetimes from nurturing to education to friends, family, and life events.

If you know someone who was convicted of a crime and imprisoned you may build a stronger belief that criminals can be rehabilitated. If you are attacked on the street violently and mugged, you may support harsher penalties under the law for criminals. And if you have a brush with death yourself, you may value all life more, appreciating how precious life really is.

It Is Not A Simple Subject
The issue is also not black and white, liberals against, conservatives in favor. Many humans fall somewhere in a grey area. Bill Clinton, liberal and Democratic President, supported the death penalty and strengthened the federal law. The Republican Party was founded in large degree to end slavery.

Politics change just as the people they represent tend to change their views as their lives progress. In one direction or the other.

The support for the death penalty decreases each year. Last year it was down to 61%. Americans are also increasingly moving to cities more and more, just like the rest of the world. Cities are in general much more liberal populations than rural areas. Cities require more public systems for the good of the whole. As this trend and others continue, the support for the death penalty will likely continue to decrease over the next several decades.

For consumers there will be more and more improvements on mobile, UI, and ease of use to produce dynamic content on an ever expanding number of social networks. We have yet to find the maximum number of social networks consumers are willing to maintain. The average continues to go up.

Facebook growth suffers from this. Though they are still innovating enough to survive as the king of the hill.

But realize, most Facebook users are on at least one other social network on a regular basis. Pinterest, G+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, etc, etc all are seeing consistent growth.

Retail Social Media

This is not to say social media for stores selling goods. Retail, as in retail politics. Hand to hand social media. Closer and closer to one on one, highly targeted messaging.

The more targeted content is the more effective the message, the ask.

Automation is getting better and better. As is CRM. Plug these two systems together and you have more relevant touchpoints with more potential customers, and excellent traffic to understand it all.

I know some people think social networks and social media tools will start consolidating, but this is not going to happen. Social media is fragmented and will remain so. There will not be another Facebook, instead there will be several Facebooks, and several tools that can help you manage those channels.

Targeting is the key. This is why FBX retargeting ads just rolled out to the Facebook newsfeed. This is why Facebook ads are so powerful, and when done right, can generate email marketing sized ROI numbers.

The real return in social media comes when targeting and consumer intelligence meet with a savvy marketer and savvy tools. Savvy because they can point highly relevant messaging to those consumers, and reap the benefits. See dark Facebook posts. See Facebook Power Editor. See retargeting.

Take a community manager. Train them how to use social ads. And you have a powerful sales machine. 

Content will increasingly be customized for a smaller and smaller audience segment.

Additionally, he made the journalist to VC jump and realized that it was a difficult jump to make, so worked his ass off for his Startups. (Versus just helping them get posts in TC).

I say this as a company he passed on,  and someone who hasn't always agreed with his views.

GV is building an apparent ""dream team"" of early and late partners that should make it possible for them to get any deal they want. (Couple that with the additional services they provide, and it's a pretty solid situation for their portfolio.)

TL;DR MG has become a solid investor that understands what GV is building, and has expanded his value to the portfolio he works with.

That being said, you are asking the wrong question.

Where you live is so much less important than how you take advantage of where you live.

As a founder all you should care about is recruiting talent and raising money. Living in Denver or Boulder doesn't preclude you from Colorado money, and SF/NY money will look at you the same.

Talent depends on your industry, etc. clearly Denver has more people and therefore is probably easier to hire than in Boulder. But if you really want to grow you better be recruiting from outside Colorado.

So it really comes down to one thing: where do you want to live?

If you know Objective-C and Cocoa APIs already you'll feel right at home. So much so that it'll feel like you're literally writing a desktop Mac app or iPhone app.

Sproutcore, on the other hand, gives you the benefits of many design patterns in Cocoa but you're not writing a new language, you're still using Javascript and your code still looks like Javascript.

d.b.a. is great but don't bother with it on weekend nights when it becomes a fratty mess and it takes 20 minutes to get a beer.  Same with Hop Devil Grill on St. Mark's.  Professor Thom's on 2nd Ave is great unless a Boston sports team has a game that night.  The likes of Mayahuel and Cienfuegos are nice, but keep in mind that the drinks are expensive and the scene gets very packed and loud during peak hours.

I'm a fan of The Immigrant on 9th between 1st and 2nd, which is a little on the ""dark and cozy"" side (e.g. can be a bit of a date bar) but is very unpretentious and is a great spot for a drink.  For something a little more unpretentious, there's Tile Bar on the northwest corner of 1st and 7th -- PBRs and a jukebox without the moderate-to-questionable sketchiness of some of the East Village's popular dives.

Caroline-McCarthy,"You know, I've looked into this extensively out of curiosity about the same question, and actually did a presentation for Ignite NYC about it last summer (
-- keep in mind that Ignite uses a pecha-kucha inspired format so it's a little jumpy as the slides keep rolling automatically).  My answer to this question is more or less from the perspective of the Gen-Y business traveler, so keep that in mind.

I believe it's been reasonably proven through survey results that Gen-Y wants to have more workplace flexibility or at least the ability to work from home.  That could easily be construed into wanting a more flexible, nomadic life.  But you also have to keep in mind the fact that the Internet actually allows us to do LESS travel -- the buzzwords here are telepresence, videoconferencing, virtual offices, etc.  Many of the same technologies that permit us to be ""anywhere"" do so because they reduce the need for face-to-face interaction.  Consequently, while we may have the ability to travel somewhere and work in the process, we also have the ability to do cheap, frequent, high-quality video calls with the people we'd be visiting in that ""somewhere.""

I think the central tension here is between having the (informational) world at your fingertips through digital technology in a way that requires less interaction with the physical world (e.g. Google it rather than biking to the library, order it online rather than going to the store), and yet being freer to roam the physical world thanks to the flexibilities that digital technology affords.

There are also some impracticalities, which I learned through a year of traveling:
Short-term sublets are much costlier per night than longer-term ones. I found this through very deep analysis (read: I was looking for somewhere to live) of Craigslist, Airbnb, etc.  I know some people who have solved this by traveling in groups or by apartment-swapping, but that is a MASSIVE logistical headache.
The IRS and the fine folks who handle your jury duty summonses do not take kindly to, ""But I'm in California for three more months and then I don't really know where I'm going.""  Trust me on this one.
There are things you don't think about immediately with regard to not having a permanent or semi-permanent residence.  I ended up spending enormously higher amounts of money on food because I didn't have a fully-stocked kitchen and pantry (spices, olive oil, rice, etc.) that would otherwise permit me to cook more frequently.

And then, lest we forget, many (most?) members of the Net Generation don't have this digital privilege anyway, even some of those who are earning very enviable salaries.  I think about what my high school and college classmates are doing, on average -- teachers, engineers, doctors, lawyers, theater professionals, the occasional coffee-shop dreamer -- and face-to-face interaction is still so crucial for those professions that ""the peripatetic life"" just isn't possible.

Oli-Gardner,"As people are saying, it depends on the use case. If you are doing it for SEO purposes it depends on what type of landing page you are talking about.

Landing pages can be any page, but an effective promotion based landing page should be a standalone entity not connected to your website, with a single focused purpose and call to action. Typically sitting on a subdomain.

If you are running a PPC campaign - then it's critical that you don't have them indexed. This is to prevent your statistics from being contaminated by different inbound traffic sources. Having a standalone landing page allows your to correctly measure it's performance and perform A/B testing.

If you are doing it for SEO, and you have them on a subdomain, be prepared to have to start from scratch with regard to rankings. And you must ensure that the content is completely original and different on each page.

Noah-Kagan,"Find paying customers before you start your business.

Offer your product to people who you think will want it (i.e. your target customer) and see if they will pay for it in advance.

Almost every business idea is guaranteed not to work out the first try. That?s why you have to Validate, Validate, Validate.

If you cannot find paying customers for your service/product/idea you have a problem, BUT you have also been given the greatest chance to learn why the person is NOT buying and what they WILL buy.

I?ve started a number of my own companies and also worked at a few startups (Facebook, Mint) that have since hit it big. My current business AppSumo was validated and built for $50. Before AppSumo, the #1 problem I found at my last business was getting customers, and it drove me crazy.

The solution? I had to go out and make sure that people actually wanted what I was offering. So I started finding web apps that I knew people were using and then tried to see if I could sell the premium version of that apps to people. The first way I validated was by offering an imgur Pro account at a special price on Reddit to Redditors. (Read How AppSumo was built for $50 for details.)

Keep in mind you do not actually need to have the product in hand or have the service set up...yet. The promise of the product is enough. Recently I started selling taco shirts, but only after my original idea failed. (How You Can Accidentally Start Your Own Company -- It?s a quick story about how to validate without spending $$.)

If potential customers don?t like your idea OR even if they like the idea but won?t pay... you know you have to find out what they will buy.

Before you start your business, and before write up a business plan, and before you start making a website, and before you print business cards, and before you create a logo, AND before you quit your day job.....

VALIDATE.


Most people start a business backwards. They do everything else before they do the most essential thing: Finding paying customers.

Once you know this and internalize it, you will see ?wantreprenuers? everywhere who have ideas, plans, and schemes?but no paying customers.

When we started Monthly1K course (How To Make a $1,000 a Month Business by AppSumo) the entire purpose was to change this problem and help the average person see/take actionable steps towards finding a profitable idea without wasting time and money.

Depending on your business/business idea, there are different ways to find your first customers. One of the best ways to come up with ideas for how to validate is to read how others found their first customers (see How I Got My First 3 Customers). In many cases they did research, found the customers' pain points, or figured out how to offer a better version of an existing service.

Bottom Line: Get paying customers before you do anything else.

Very Basic Examples of Validation:

Starting a Restaurant: Sell what you think will be your top plates at a dinner party. Ask people to send you $20 by PayPal in advance?before you buy the ingredients. Sell 20+ plates in advance.

Starting a Service: Look through Craiglist, forums, or Quora to find people who need what you?re offering. Email them, call them, tweet them and offer your services but make them pay first (discount a little if you have to).

Selling a Product: Send an email to friends and family about the product, what it will do, how it will solve their problems and ask them to PayPal you $15 - $45 in advance. If you are solving a real problem or fulfilling a need, they will pay.

Noah-Kagan,"Every business gets its first clients differently. The challenge for many entrepreneurs is to get their first three customers.

Before diving into my answer, it?s important to get your first clients BEFORE you start your business.

Traditional answers start by telling you to build a website, print business cards, and take out ads. Many of the most successful businesses take an approach that allows them to validate (see whether or not people will pay you) their business, their ideas, and value proposition before jumping in with both feet. When they validate (find their first three paying clients) or fail at validating they either strengthen their original idea OR they are able to find a new business/idea without wasting time, money, social capital.

When we started the website How I Got My First 3 Customers (more than 60 entrepreneurs tell their stories) we found that the way people get their first clients is as different as the founders and businesses themselves. There are too many stories to write up, but here is an overview (check out the full website for all of the stories).

For some bloggers, their first readers were family members and coworkers. Some new business got a lucky break from a local newspaper that decided to cover the business. Although many slugged it out by going door to door to offer free estimates, others spun their 9to5 skills and industry knowledge into a side project leveraging free work for testimonials and referrals.

A few basic ideas on how to get your first clients:
Visited 250 houses in 6 hours. Result: 11 leads and closed 5 clients.
Started visiting forums, going to meet ups, interviewing people. Result: Built an app that addressed customers need and then scaled to grow the business.
Reach out to those really close to you and willing to help. Result: One major client came through a friend of a friend.
Search for people disliking competitor products by looking at people follow or like competitors on Facebook. Result: You have a potential client looking for something better from the start.
Interview potential customers to design the service/product to them. Result: These interviewees often turn into clients.
Some advice from these entrepreneurs:
Don't underestimate forums. We Googled ""kpop forums"" and reached out to fans from there.
Do what you are good at. Go after it. Do it cheap and don't spend money before you make money.
Business starts and thrives on word of mouth, referrals, and product research.
Build relationships with key influencers and potential 'referral partners' who are connected within your target customer's circles, and offer to help them, do great work, even do it for FREE.
Keep trying every method possible then stop and keep doing what works.

As Oliver Emberton wrote earlier, it is one challenge to get your first clients and it is another challenge to get your first paying clients. When you are able to offer some value up front (show them something new, solve a small part of their problem, or introduce them to a new software) and whet their appetite. IF you are able to solve REAL problems for people you will be able to get clients. If you are great at solving real problems (and enjoyable to work with) you will be able to get many more clients! (A lot of people feel guilty charging for their time or service starting out [see How Not to Feel Guilty about Charging For Your Time.] Remember you are helping to make money for your customers and clients.)

I?ve helped hundreds of businesses validate and launch successfully. In the past year, we launched ""How To Make a $1,000 a Month Business.""

Here's an example of One of the Best Cold Emails I?ve EVER Received.

I'd suggest to email a current customer who knows them and ask for a referral.

If that person doesn't want to, no sweat. Ask if you can use their name.

Then use the subject line ""Referred by Person's Name.""

Otherwise, 3 options I've seen work quite well:
Relevant and personal. For me, it would be referencing taco deli. The short is that it shows you've spent more than 5 minutes and value the time of the recipient. ""Noah I know you love taco deli....""
Flattery. ""How AppSumo changed my life...""

Noah-Kagan,"Love this question since it applies to so many physical stores.

The key thing is to ensure you have the customers available before you consider opening a physical location.



The easiest way is to use Eventbrite or just Paypal and do what I call the ""home"" technique validation.

Invite over your friends, families, co-workers etc to eat vegetarian food at your house.

CHARGE THEM.

Have them paypal you directly or setup an Eventbrite page with a certain # of tickets for dinner available.

Yes, you can charge your friends / associates. If they aren't willing to give you money, why would randoms?

Let them know the menu ahead of time.

I'd continue repeating this model until you can't handle the # of people available at your house. One option would be to raise your prices at this point.

Then you can consider getting a physical location or a trailer.

One hack I learned recently is there are many vacant buildings you can rent out for free or low cost to use as dining space until you have a loyal following.

A few ways to get customers outside of your immediate circle:

1- Look for people who've checked into vegetarian restaurants on Foursquare

2- Reach out to people on Yelp who've reviewed positively / negatively

3- Go to Vegetarian Meetup groups.

4- Ask your co-workers / friends for

5- Look for Houston food bloggers to come review and eat at your place. Their input can be helpful in improving your menu.

Christina-Warren,"As you mention, Swype is one of the bigger players in this space. For people who get the system, it has the potential to be faster, but it's still following the same keyboard paradigms of old.

Usability studies have shown that while the DVORAK layout is faster and can make more sense to the brain, when learned and utilized, most people are born and raised as QWERTY users through and through. Realistically speaking, I don't see a big shift away from QWERTY as long as traditional keyboards are still a central part of the computing experience outside of the smartphone/tablet.

The big movements I see, with the exception of other Swype like services (which in some ways, really kind of recall the old Palm OS stylus language, which if pressed, I could probably use today without any issues), is in predictive text entry. The predictive text engines are getting better and better all the time. This is an area that lots of companies are investing heavily in, because with the right sort of engine, and especially with systems that can ""learn"" usage, word choices and have a better sense of context and grammar, this can do much to speed up data entry and output.

Likewise, I see a growing shift to improved voice recognition. Google's voice search tools are quite good; so is the engine used by Dragon Dictation.

It works the same on Mac, Windows, Linux, can be easily integrated into mobile and desktop apps (which makes the process painless and invisible for the user) and it's fast.

Having something work reliably and seamlessly is a big deal. If I copy or create a folder in Dropbox, I know that it will soon be available on my other systems or if absolutely needed, on the web. I don't have to use a web-based uploader, I don't have to mess with any sharing settings and I don't have to change anything other than making sure the file is in the Dropbox folder.

As Michael Wolfe said, it doesn't add on extra features that people don't want. Sure, you can extend Dropbox's usefulness with some really geeky add-ons, but the base product just does what it does. Most importantly, it does it well.

Marc-Bodnick,"There is no question that Sand Hill Road is less cool than it used to be. Having said that, many of the best venture firms are still there -- Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner, Sequoia, Greylock. Many senior partners at these firms have built their lives and families around Silicon Valley, and anyone with kids in school won't want to move. So I think Sand Hill will be important for a while.

But the future is probably San Francisco. To the extent Silicon Valley remains a stronghold for venture, I think downtown Palo Alto (where Accel, Matrix, Social+Capital, and a few other firms are) will be the hot spot.

At Silicon Valley firms where the key partners don't have kids in school, you might see them move north.

Related thoughts:
Companies really don't like traveling to Sand Hill Road. (I'm speaking for myself, but I think others share this opinion.) There's nothing to do there, and company founders generally don't like eating in conference rooms, even if they are fancy and the food is good. Sand Hill Road feels insular and corporate.
The power continues to shift toward companies and away from investors. Which means that investors are going to be traveling to companies more and more, and not vice versa. This is a trend that's been in play for a while.
There are virtually no restaurants on Sand Hill, except for Madera, which is pretty stuffy and dominated by bankers and similar folks.

Antone-Johnson,"It was highly inappropriate and probably illegal.  If I were them I'd explore filing suit against her for ""false light"" invasion of privacy at a minimum, perhaps other privacy and defamation claims as well.

The two aspects eliciting tremendous backlash are (1) plain hypersensitivity to an overheard conversation not intended for her, and (2) extreme overreaction involving multiple steps taken, knowingly and intentionally, to inflict public damage on private individuals ? whether as retribution, for her own self-aggrandizement, or other reasons.

In general, we are not entitled to ambush an ordinary person on private property, photograph them up close without their consent, broadcast those photos to thousands of members of the general public while claiming on a pure hearsay basis that the people pictured are guilty of misconduct.  Ironically, Richards used (abused) her own privilege to publicly shame two previously unknown people to make a point about privilege.  A much safer way to report this kind of thing while seeking maximum publicity would be to go to the press, giving them the photos and telling the story.  Decent journalists would research it, look to verify facts and seek comment, etc. before running the story.

Saying off-color things to each other, not intending to be overheard is not harassment. We are all subjected to tastless jokes and other offensive remarks our entire lives.  How many times have you overheard a racist joke?  Believe it or not, plenty of women actually find dick jokes to be funny (at least some of the time).  Like, I dunno, my wife (who's done improv comedy) or pretty much every comedienne alive.  Have you listened to Sarah Silverman?  Watched Sex and the City (TV series & creative franchise)?  How on earth could something involving ""dongles"" be so offensive as to constitute harassment if unintentionally overheard?  In fact, isn't it patronizing to assume in this day and age that all women are such delicate flowers that their tender ears need to be sheltered from profanity or coarse humor?  (Importantly, if there were things like threats of violence involved, mention of rape, etc., I will eagerly eat my words.  I haven't read anything to that effect.)  The term ""pedestalism"" comes to mind ? see Frontiero v. Richardson.

This is noise to be tuned out, or boorish behavior to be reported to the conference organizers in keeping with event policy.  It would be harassment if it were aimed at her, which by all accounts it was not ? or if these yahoos persisted after Richards made it clear she could overhear and found their remarks unwelcome.  Without those things, it lacks the necessary element of intent.  Clearly nobody intended to hurt, harm, intimidate or harass her.  By contrast, everything about Richards' conduct was deliberate, intended to cause as much harm and/or milk as much publicity as she could from that single event.

Instagram vs. Vine for short video clips ought to be a good showdown. Personally I lean toward Instagram because it's one app that can do two things well (pictures and video) + include Foursquare check-in.
GroupMe for group text messaging has been useful in the past. Nothing new, but it fills the need for real-time updates about parties, wait times, etc.
Evernote for making notes about virtually anything, anytime, anywhere, on any device. The Swiss Army knife of apps, it captures photos, scans documents, business cards, records voice memos. Also geotags and titles quick entries relying on both GPS and calendar entries (e.g., ""Notes from meeting with Marc Bodnick at Antone's, West Fifth Street, Austin, TX."")
Cobook or Contactually for adding/tracking contacts, merging their social media info, etc.

Buffer for sharing the best of everything on multiple networks without being too spammy.

Antone-Johnson,"I agree with the general sentiment expressed by others:  Probably not if it's a California corporation and most or all investors are based in California; otherwise, it could present a (generally surmountable) challenge to closing a financing round.

California is home to the largest concentration of startups and VCs in the U.S.  It also spawned the odd creature known as the quasi-California corporation.  State law provides that regardless of where a company is incorporated, it will be treated as if it were a California corporation for purposes of certain key governance requirements if the company's center of gravity is in California and a majority of its shares are held by Californians.  For startups based here, that effectively undermines some of the benefits of incorporating in Delaware or other company-friendly jurisdictions.  (Without going down that rathole, recent court decisions have called this law's enforceability into question.)

In VC-sized deals ($1MM+), it will always be worth the expense and hassle to reincorporate in Delaware simply to close the investment.  At the opposite extreme, if an angel offers $20,000 but wants to invest in a Delaware corporation, it may not be worth it.  In that sense, it could make a difference at the margin, which is one reason I generally favor Delaware from inception.

The question asks about investors in general, not limited to Venture Capital or typical Angel Investors.  Anecdotally, I've seen non-traditional investors increasingly involved in financing early stage ventures.  If the lead (or only) investor is located somewhere else, it could be happy with its own home state as the corporation's domicile, as it undoubtedly has legal, accounting and other experts in that state.  (Think of a Texas billionaire investing in a Texas corporation as one example.)  International investors often find it beneficial for tax reasons to invest in a Cayman Islands or other offshore entity.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"No.  Ignoring technical issues (does the data even still exist?) and looking only at the legal side, the analysis depends on who's seeking the posts and in what context.  It can get complicated in a hurry, but the basic rule in the U.S. is that contents of electronic communications (as opposed to metadata like time/date stamps) can only be produced to government agencies with a search warrant, and only to private parties (everyone else) with the consent of the subject.

Posts, like email messages, are considered content.  Government entities can subpoena the most basic user information (email address, etc.) but need a court order for more detailed metadata and a warrant (issued by a judge upon finding probable cause) for access to the contents.  It's analogous to police looking at the outside of an envelope with address and postmark, etc., vs. opening and reading it.  The law in question is the Stored Communications Act, a part of the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA).

Private parties in litigation can subpoena user data / metadata but not content.  ECPA is strict on that point.  If you think about it, this actually makes sense:  If you're litigating a dispute with someone, the court expects you to subpoena the other person to produce copies of messages herself (either by just handing it over or by voluntarily requesting her own records from the service provider and then delivering them) ? or not:  These things are fought over in litigation.

Bottom line:  Even if the data exists, law enforcement needs a warrant, and everyone else can't get from the service provider at all.
  "
Antone-Johnson,"Because the relevant stock exchange rules don't require it.  At the risk of sounding flip, a billion dollars ? in cash and/or stock ? isn't that much money to a truly large corporation.  With Yahoo!'s current Market Capitalization of nearly $30 billion, issuing another $1 billion of stock would only dilute existing stockholders by about 3%.  That's significant but not earth-shattering.

Yahoo! shares are traded on NASDAQ.  The so-called ""Nasdaq 20% rule"" (1) requires shareholder approval of a transaction if the number of shares to be issued is greater than 20% of the shares of stock (or voting power) outstanding before the deal (subject to some exceptions).  Three percent obviously comes nowhere near this 20% threshold.  If Y! were making a $6 billion acquisition it would likely need shareholder approval.

What about the feds, you ask?  You've seen SEC Filings by companies seeking shareholder approval for Mergers & Acquisitions, etc.  Well, yes, but that's primarily about disclosure, not governance.  For the most part, federal securities law regulates sales of securities to the public ('33 Act), ongoing disclosure by companies issuing securities ('34 Act), and securities industry participants such as broker-dealers ('40 Act).  Corporate Governance matters are mostly regulated by state law (Delaware in the case of almost all large U.S. corporations), plus stock exchange listing requirements for the minority that qualify and choose to have their shares listed for trading, as YHOO does on Nasdaq.  That said, Congress did poke its nose into corporate governance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, after enough meltdowns of Enron- and Worldcom-sized proportions prompted public outcry, but the governance piece of SOX didn't exactly set federal standards.  Rather, it instructed the stock exchanges to go forth and regulate, and the SEC then gave its seal of approval to the resulting rules.

That gives her a big out to say ""No, my boss is a hard-ass"" or ""I don't have much privacy at work so everyone's in my business,"" etc.  Then take her at her word and don't read too much into it.  Nobody knows what's inside your GF's head except her.

Sarah-Perez,"Seriously, at what point can we change this outdated etiquette rule for good? At what point is buttered too much butter to be acceptable? This is way too vague a rule. I can't stand to see people eating asparagus with their fingers. It looks bad, and seems slovenly, even if it's technically ""correct."" If most people don't even know the rule exists, and find it rude, then perhaps the consensus should lead the way on this one. Please stop eating asparagus with your fingers, I beg you!

Sarah-Perez,"Uninstalling apps will help, but also moving them to an SD card, as noted above. However, on the Nexus S, there's no SD card slot, only internal USB storage. In this case, you can go into Settings/Applications and move apps one by one to the USB storage.

Clearing the cache on some apps may help too.

Removing files (docs, photos, music, videos) from the device would also free up space.

Fred-Wilson,"It's not cost of living or cost of/lack of dev talent. It's the fact that everyone sells out too early in NYC. They don't have any role models of big independent companies to look at for inspiration. That will change in my opinion, but it takes time to create role models.
