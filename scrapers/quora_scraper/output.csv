Robert-Scoble-1,"Update. It's now almost a year since I got mine and I find my utility going down because Google has not yet fixed the major problems.

Voice response only works if you have a connection. Often I'm in a place, like Yellowstone, that has no connectivity.
You can only put 10 contacts into Glass, so making calls much more difficult than it should be.
You can't see, edit, or caption photos in Glass easily (only voice commands, which don't work in noisy situations like concerts). No way to automatically push photos from Glass to your smartphone, which would make it a LOT easier to edit, etc.
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter apps inadequate for really doing great posts.
No store, so getting apps very difficult.
Voice control of directions is usually good, but when it makes an error it is very hard to fix.
No live video streaming yet.
Battery life continues being too short, particularly when shooting video (I only get about 40 minutes when recording video).
Video compression is being done in software, not hardware, so unit gets hot, video isn't very high quality, and battery dies in 45 minutes or less.
Video only goes to a special part of Google+ (a new version of YouTube) and you can't easily push it to other places, like Vimeo, or your existing YouTube account.
The price is still at least twice as expensive as the most expensive smartphone and doesn't work without a smartphone. Until the price comes down I'll advise most people to stay away, especially given the lack of utility at the moment (and the risks that the UI and API's will dramatically shift this year).

There are other problems, as well, that keep it from being very useful. When I wrote the post below I thought Google would fix the problems quickly. I keep hoping fixes are coming.

I have had a Google Glass for two weeks now and they are VERY useful. Here's my review: My two-week review of Google Glass: it all depends on the?

Why? Well, just yesterday I was walking my kids around in a stroller. Both hands were on the stroller. Yet I was able to have New York Times articles read to me, I took a phone call (and made one to my wife), and I took a photo of the experience too.

This product is life changing. By the way, the Glass can NOT broadcast live to the world yet. You can shoot a video, have it uploaded to a private area on Google+, and only then can you move it over to public view from your smartphone or from inside the Glass itself.

After showing them to hundreds of people, I think the threats are mostly perception issues: if you walk into the wrong kind of bar, or a bathroom or gym locker room with them on, you might suffer consequences that won't be fun.

The big usefulness, though, is that these assist you living your life. When I got to the airport the other day it told me the gate and time of my flight. Very useful. Google Now also tells me other stuff, like how bad the traffic is on the way to work, etc. That's where the real functionality is.

Robert-Scoble-1,"Easy. Walk into any restaurant. Look at how many people are holding a mobile phone. Now consider that about a billion people are getting smartphones this year alone. Second, look at adoption rates of new things on laptops vs. mobile. Mobile is way higher. Third, look at numbers at some place like Facebook -- mobile is passing desktop usage.

I often sit next to people who use Windows PCs and I ask them ""show me something you've put on your computer that's new, loaded in the past couple of weeks."" Out of hundreds of people most can't answer that. Ask a mobile user the same thing and they'll take you on a tour of their apps ""oh, just got this Dots game, or check out the new Nest app I just got, etc etc.""

The tech press and investors care about where the market is going. Where is growth happening. Where are the most interesting, new, apps?

In my world: mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile.
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I get way more requests than I can take. Here's a few things I do:

1. I have an out-of-office message on Gmail that gives me the permission not to answer you (no answer is an ""automatic no"" the email says). Here's that email -- that lets me avoid being a jerk just by not replying:

++++++++++++++

Thank you for taking the time to write to me and I'm sorry if I don't get back to you.

I'm now getting emails at a level that I can't respond to everyone. This is an automatic response to an email you sent to scobleizer@gmail.com.

I will make a best attempt to get back to you, especially if you are sharing world-changing technology or if you are building contextual software or services, since I wrote a book with Shel Israel on that trend. Our book, ""Age of Context,"" has been released at Age of Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy eBook: Robert Scoble, Shel Israel: Kindle Store

I also am looking for best-of-breed tools to help people build companies on top of cloud infrastructure, due to my role at Rackspace.

I do read every email, but I only can reply to about 5%, sorry.

Unfortunately if I don't answer you within two or three days, it's the same as hearing ""no.""

To PR people, if you want me to cover your product you've got to give me more than one day warning.  I don't do press-release rewrites like other tech bloggers. It's best to get in touch with me at LEAST A MONTH before you launch.

If you are looking for more about where I'm publishing, or just want to have an informal chat, visit Robert Scoble | Facebook which has links to all of my blogs, and social media accounts.

Another way to get through is to talk with my producer, Rocky Barbanica. You can reach him at rocky@rackspace.com.

Thanks and sorry if I don't get back to you.

++++++++++++++

2. Have a philosophy. Mine is contextual computing is going to be more and more interesting. So, if you aren't contextual (mobile first) and using sensors, wearable computers, etc, then I will be less interested in you. This lets me say no in a nice way. ""Sorry, I'm looking for a specific kind of interaction in 2014 and you don't fit.""

3. Have a boss who makes you say no due to other interests. Boss's don't need to be employers, either. My kids and wife are in charge of my life too and demand my time the same as others do. ""My wife won't let me fit that speech into our calendar, sorry."" Or, ""my kids haven't seen me for a month so I can't make that dinner, sorry."" Works just as well as ""my boss at Rackspace already signed me up for another speech that evening, sorry.""

4. Know what you want out of life. I want to have more three-star Michelin-rated dinners. So, if you offer me one of those I'll find it very hard to turn down. I also want to see the next big company when it's just two entrepreneurs at a table. I find it hard to turn down a chance to see another company, particularly one that has an interesting new product coming out.

5. Try to be helpful in some other way. ""Hey, I can't do that interview you wanted me to do because I'm already booked this week, how about I introduce you to some other journalists who can help?""

6. Suggest ways to get to success. Those who are busy are very transactional. So, asking for coffee might get turned down, while asking to meet to pitch might not. Coffee implies some sort of squishy social agenda. ""I don't do coffee, but if you have a pitch please email me that."" Often they really just wanted to pitch you anyway and were trying to be nice by asking to buy you coffee.

7. If the person sounds interesting to at least meet, suggest meeting at an event ""hey, I'm about to head to CES in Vegas, will you be there or at SXSW in March?""

8. Be honestly busy. My calendar is 100% filled for January now. I'm very happy to show you my Google Calendar, which demonstrates that well. So, saying ""I'm booked until February and not booking new things"" works.

9. Ask them to go through someone who has an easier time saying no. For instance, I have a producer, Rocky Barbanica. He is far more willing to say no than I am. That said, if you convince him, it usually is because you actually have something great, so I'm more willing to put you on the calendar after you get through him.

10. Push them over to a social network. I do that because I want to be scalable in everything I do (answering a question on Quora, for instance, helps out potentially thousands of people, while answering a question in email only helps one person out). So, saying ""ask that question on Quora"" is a good way to turn down people. Smart people use Facebook to see when I'm online, too (I'll often chat with you there before answering my own email).

UPDATE: a friend, Loic Le Meur, turned down my request by saying simply ""I'll be on Necker Island then."" (That's the island that Richard Branson owns). I'll add that as #11: be doing something far cooler than what is being offered. :-)
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I would say that you should contact a tech journalist only AFTER you do this:

Know and follow at least 50 (I have a list of 600+ tech journalists on Twitter at Tech News People).
Make sure your startup might be interesting to the journalist in question.
Know why said tech journalist MIGHT cover you and HOW he/she might cover you (IE, have an interesting story). If I was trying to get into the New York Times, for instance, I'd read at least 500 articles written there first and I'd even start putting them into buckets. Know what bucket yours will go in.
Know how your startup is better than other companies already on the field.

Remember that, in my case, I only can accept about 1% of what gets pitched to me. I'm looking for companies who are pushing the future forward. That's vague, but not really. scobleizer@gmail.com is generally the best but phone can work too. +1-425-205-1921 -- know when I'm online and available, you can tell this from Facebook, in my case: https://www.facebook.com/RobertS...

Some tips?

Keep it short.
Explain why you are an example of how the future is changing.
Bring up anything that backs up your story (for instance, do you have a famous developer who already changed the world at, say, Apple?)
Make it easy to dive in. Do you have a blog? A video? A bunch of people talking about you on Twitter or Google+ or Facebook? A successful Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign?
Work hard on a great headline. Lots of us get 1,000 press releases a day. Think about how to stand out.
Get someone we trust to refer you. If Marc Andreessen emails me and says ""Scoble, you gotta see this new company"" you bet your bottom dollar I'll stop and pay attention.
ALWAYS carry your demo on your phone or iPad and be willing to show in weird places. Accidental PR is the best. I've found many of my favorite companies away from ""official PR.""
Be persistent, but not overbearing. Sometimes trying a second try when you have something new to announce works. I don't know why. It's just the luck of the draw. The difference between being persistent and being overbearing is a very thin line, though. Be good at listening to feedback.
If in a crowded market (photo sharing services, for instance) you better be 10x better and you better be able to demonstrate that in 30 seconds or less. Google was the 17th search engine but in just one search I was hooked and saw why it was better.

Some don'ts?

Don't mix social and business. If you want to just hang out with us and be our friend, that's OK, but don't try to ""buddy up"" just to get a chance to pitch me. Our social time is for socializing, not work.
Don't ask to pitch. The answer is ALWAYS no. Instead, ask something like ""I have a ground-breaking iPad app that is 10x better than Microsoft Office, what do you need to verify that what I'm telling you is true?""
Don't pitch us without looking at our Twitter and Facebook (even better if you use a tool like Nimble.com that shows you everything about us) . I have gotten a pitch right after I learned my mom was dying (I wrote about that online).
If you meet me in the street, don't try to pitch me unless you have some very unusual social proof (like if you are hanging out with Marc Andreessen and he verifies that what you are building is the best thing he's seen this year). I never remember these ""street"" pitches and they rarely are any good anyway. Instead, introduce yourself, and ask for our email so that you can pitch us professionally.
Don't pitch us on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Email is best for a whole lot of reasons (at least in my case). If you do pitch us there you'll get instructions to pitch us on email (mine is scobleizer@gmail.com ). I hate these social pitches because I can't easily search for them in the future and I often don't have time to answer everyone everywhere so focus on my email first.

Robert-Scoble-1,"I always want to be on the bleeding edge, or, more accurately use tools that are ""best of breed."" For the past seven years that was Apple's iPhone which is, still, arguably the best mobile ecosystem out there. Apps still ship on iPhone first (generally) and when I look at tech passionate people most of them still have iPhones and iPads.

That said, things are switching. Read Paul Stamatiou, designer at Twitter, about his experiences with Android: Android is better I agree with all his points.

My view started shifting last year when I saw a new series of trends that, bundled up, bring us contextual computing (I'm writing a book on those trends with Shel Israel, titled ""Age of Context"" that will come later this year).

Most of the apps in this new field are on Android first because of Android's more open approach. A great example is Everything.me - Introducing the Dynamic Phone TM, which is my favorite app switcher. It can change nearly everything about the phone and hook into all your apps, even. Things that are impossible for developers to do on iOS.

These new contextual apps, including Google Now, got me to look at Android in a new light. No longer was it an uglier cousin of iOS but was bringing very real innovation to bear.

Then, when Google Glass came out, my mind totally switched. I was  one of the first in line at last year's Google IO conference to lay down $1,500 for my own Google Glass (I've been wearing them every day since April 16, 2013).

Google Glass is a real game changer. No other consumer electronics device knows where I'm aimed, where I'm looking, and has such a consistent access to my context through the sensors inside.

Of course it works better with Android (it runs Android 4.0.4 inside). So that pushed me to make the switch.

Later, Moto X showed me that there's yet again, more innovation coming on the Android side of the fence (you can't talk to your iPhone without touching it first), but on Moto X it just listens for you to say ""OK Google Now."" Since it is illegal to touch a phone while driving, both Glass and Moto X are big deals for me since I drive 1.5 hours every day to the Rackspace Studio in San Francisco and back.

That all said, I still have an iPad and am watching the Apple ecosystem closely. Most users won't follow me, there aren't enough advantages -- yet. But with Paul's note, and my observations, there is something happening on the Android side of the fence and I think it'll become more obvious next year that Android has taken the innovation crown away from Apple (and everyone else).
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"It's expensive because the ones that are being distributed now are prototypes that are being built one-by-one.

I expect that when they are released to the public next year they will be somewhere around $200 to $300. The build-of-materials is somewhere around $100, when you look at all the components. Of course that doesn't cover the millions of dollars spent in R&D and in acquiring people, like Thad Starner, to come and build them.

Some reasons they are so expensive (this isn't the first time a company has charged a lot for developer prototypes -- the Xbox prototypes were about the same price):

Supply and demand. They can only make a few hundred per week at this point. So, having a low price wouldn't make sense. When you have very little supply and a lot of demand, raising the price is perfectly reasonable.
Making sure that the best people get them first. If I were Google I'd want mostly developers to have them at this point so that there'd be some apps when they are released early in 2014. Developers see the value in building companies and products to target a new platform. Paying $1,500 to build something like Instagram won't seem significant in three years if the business is successful. Most other people won't see the value in paying $1,500 for an unproven new gadget.
PR reasons. If you spend $1,500 for a pre-release prototype you know what you are getting into. You'll likely give a lot of feedback to Google. You'll likely understand the limitations (there are MANY app holes right now, for instance) and forgive those. Regular people, if they got them at this point, wouldn't understand those limitations and would complain about them on Twitter and Facebook, etc.
Anyway, I think this is a short term problem. By May most people will be able to buy them and I can't see a reason that Google would charge more than $500 for them (and I can see many that they would want to make them very low cost, like $200).

Evan-Williams,"Another reason it became standard to break an article up is because it increases the number of pageviews and, thus, ad impressions.
  "
Evan-Williams,"I can't think of one.

All the companies mentioned here either:

a) *Did* have significant revenues:
Netscape (the same company as Mosaic, btw) made $400M in revenue the first 9 months of 1997: http://sec.edgar-online.com/nets...
Geocities (This is a guess, but I bet that traffic made Yahoo! a boatload of money back when banner dollars were easy to get. Maybe not enough to justify the $3.5B acquisition price, but that wasn't the question. Anyone know?)
Shutterfly (see comment above)

b) Didn't really have a lot of users. (What's ""a lot"" anyway?)
4chan?

c) Got bought, ran out of funding due to dot-com crash, or sued out of existence before they tried in earnest to monetize. None of these are the same as ""failing"" to monetize.
Geocities (Even if not really in category A under Yahoo's regime, they are here.)
Almost everyone else mentioned

Possible exceptions (don't really know the story on either of these, but I doubt it):
JenniCam (was she a company?)
DejaNews (did they have any users?)
Ning (I think they were growing well for a while, not sure what happened exactly.)

Having a large number of users and the inability to monetize them is a non-existent problem. People talk about it all the time, but it doesn't really happen?at least it doesn't happen in today's world. I'm not even sure it ever did. Sure, there were Internet companies that went out of business because they were losing too much money, but I think usually they didn't *really* have a lot of users (just a lot of hype) or they had out of control costs.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"My job is to find the binary projects (like Uber) that most folks don't understand until they change the world. I was in the first round of Uber because when I saw just one taxi on Travis' iPhone and his passion it was clear to me that he would scale it to thousands.... of course, I would be lying if I said I saw it getting to where it is today (much more than thousands) as quickly as it has.

Yoga and $4 coffee are examples of crazy trends from the 80s that have become something almost everyone has either tried or participates in. In 1987 the idea of spending $3 on a .25-.50 cup of joe was insane.



The idea of bankers and lawyers doing yoga in 1986? Also absurd... but now it's not uncommon to see 15 to 70 years olds in the same yoga class! It's 100% normal.

Meditation? Seems strange to some, until they do it and have a massive, life changing event. Which it has been for me and countless others.

If you want to know if this will work, get the 1.0 of the App and spend $10 for the yearly pass. Do it 10 days in a row before you go to bed.

If you don't feel you got your money's worth I will hand you a $10 bill.

note: there is still a 70% chance that a startup like Calm.com will fail... that's just math/historical trends. Of course, I think it has a 70% chance of being a $100m+ business that will get my investors 10-25x their investment.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"You should talk directly with the owner of the businesss if you have this much leverage, and you should center your ""package"" around getting close to that individul.

As a developer you will have a ton of options--that's not what is important in startup life. Being as close to the founder, the investors, the board and the decision making process is the place you want to be.

So, if it was me I'd say:

1.  In terms of pay I'd like to have whatever the difference is between the top developer on the team and the CEO -- even if it is lower. (i.e. CEO takes $100k, top developer gets $130k you take $115k).

2. That you get a stock package that is 2x the current best developer OR what the stock package would have been if you joined in the A round (i.e. time machine). You can say ""if i suck you fire me and I lose it all due to the 1 year cliff).

3. Most important: I will only take the job if I get to have a 1-on-1 lunch with the founder 2x a year and we put it on the schedle now--because I want to learn and understand the business deeply.

This puts you in the ""massive team player"" and ""close to the crown"" categories... which is really where you want to be.

4. Finally, max cash is bullshit in our industry. There is always more money somewhere, and after $1XXk you're life isn't much difference (the beach in fiji, maui and mexico is the exact same... just 10x the price difference). So, optimize for the BEST TEAM and BEST PRODUCT and BEST MISSION. That will give you the most joy and happiness.

5. Loyalty: be a loyal melon farmer always... too many people get caught up in cash and the shinny new objects. like relationships, the best ones are built through the tought times. Stick with a great leader and team for 2-5 years.... because all the good stuff is in year 3, 4 and 5 of a project. Years one and two are just slogging generally.

Dave-McClure,"as jeff notes, typical fund investors tend to be institutional, corporate, or family office groups (collections of rich people), as well as high net worth folks (individual rich people).

some of the more successful & well-known micro-VC funds raise from the same sources as larger VC funds, however since most of us haven't been around very long (<5 years) and start out with smaller funds (<$50M), it's difficult to raise money from traditional VC investors because of our limited track record, and because they can't / don't write checks smaller than $5-10M. they may also have max ownership restrictions where they can't be more than 10-20% of the capital in any one fund.

in any case, 500 Startups first fund started out with a mix of individuals (lots of friends we knew from PayPal, Google, Facebook, YouTube, Linkedin, Twitter, etc), corporate investors, and some VC funds / individual partners. gradually as we have gotten more established & raised larger funds, we have begun aiming for larger investors from more traditional sources.

however, we still have a large # of small investors who helped us get started early, and we appreciate them a hell of a lot. in particular, some high-profile VCs & entrepreneurs were kind enough to write us small checks in the beginning, which helped us a LOT to get off the ground & legitimize us to other investors.
  "
Dave-McClure,"aS
  "
Dave-McClure,"all these answers are nonsense & mathematically flawed. it has absolutely nothing to do with returns.

the reason is because they want to hold board seats in the company, and have controlling stakes in governance.

there is *NO* good logic behind VCs taking 20% of individual companies in order to generate returns. they could take a lower % of more co's, or a higher % of fewer co's, and still achieve target returns (altho note that most do not).

more likely, the 20% ownership target is  practical for traditional VCs that aim to hold board seats -- given most companies only have 3-5 board seats in the earlier years, it would be difficult to obtain and/or defend a board seat without owning a proportional amount of preferred shares of the company that the board seat represents. thus, a 20% target stake would be enough to both 1) acquire and 2) keep a board seat where there might be a small # available.

this is the only rational explanation why VCs aim for some arbitrary ownership %, other than most people simply repeating this as an industry best practice, without having the faintest idea why or how it came about.

if someone has a better reason I'm all ears, but I haven't heard any persuasive argument in the past decade or more I've been involved in the business.

(people tend to copy what others have done in the past, without investigating whether the past was any good ;)

for the record: 500 Startups does not believe this is the only viable strategy for good VC fund performance. in fact, we believe a larger sample size (>100) of co's in early-stage portfolios is a much better strategy for improving returns, and we generally do not care much about taking board seats nor ownership %... however we *DO* care about valuation, and we believe investing early at lower cost will give us a better shot at good returns.
  "
Dave-McClure,"well, at least for many small funds the 2% part of 2-20 doesn't usually work so well... or at least, spreading it out over 10 years doesn't work well. note that most funds operate for ten years, and charge fees for most if not all of those years.

many small funds (including ours) structure fees so that they happen earlier in the fund life cycle, when most of the work (& costs) related to executing the fund investments happen.

for example: in our first fund, we had a front-loaded fee schedule that started at 3% for the first two years, then decrements 0.5% every two years, ending up at 1% for the last two years.

In our most recent fund, we actually reduced fees overall to only 1.5% average for 10 years, but made fees 3% for the first two years, then 2% for the next two years, then only 1% for the next four years, and ending with only 0.5% for the last two years.

for more info on how 500 business model works, see my previous Quora answer here:
Dave McClure's answer to 500 Startups: What is 500 Startups' business model?

I've also heard other funds may charge a flat rate amount that is collected at the beginning of the fund life. note that this might be risky if the fund manager runs out of money too quickly, and doesn't have enough left to finish executing the fund strategy.

in any case, small funds will very often have higher expenses on a percentage basis than large funds, particularly early in the first few years of fund life, and thus might need to consider other fee strategies than just the standard 2% for ten years.

ultimately, altho percentage-based fee structures have been a historical industry standard, a budget-based fee structure that is matched to the actual timing of fund expenses probably makes more sense.

at 500 Startups, we have had to be creative in coming up with other revenue sources than just depending on management fees in order to cover our costs. this has worked well for us, and has resulted in us charging less in fees and not depending as much on fund size to drive our budget.

Jeremiah-Owyang,"A Breakdown of the Scoble Effect in Five Phases.

First of all, I've been watching Robert closely for over 6 years. I knew him when he was the chief blog evangelist at Microsoft, at his book launch party at Techcrunch's backyard and went to work with him at PodTech for a year.  We're still very much good friends and our families enjoy time together.  Yet while I know him well, I'll give you the straight truth on how he does it.

It's part of my job (and inquisitive behavior) to break things into small pieces and look for patterns, and I'll do that for this influencer.  I am an Industry Analyst and have devoted my career to studying this space, watching influence patterns is a key part of the role.

Scoble has a cyclical pattern to all disruptive technologies that break down in the following process.  I've seen him do the following for Blogs, Twitter, LiveStreaming, Facebook, Friendfeed, FourSquare, Cinch, and most recently, Quora.

1) Going Wide on the Market. First of all, he places 'bets' on most disruptive and new technologies, also known as the ""shiny syndrome"".  This is his very difficult to do, since it requires him to be constantly on the ground, his show helps him to meet all these young startups while they are still in their garages.

2) Prime and Pump. While most of his bets never take off, some do, he can 'feel' the signals from other early influencers and then starts to pump the market.  He can do this in a combination of tweets, or blog posts.  Expect his blog posts to say ""Why I love X"" and then later a contrasting post ""Why I hate it"" or ""Why I was wrong"".  This leads to great controversy which sets up for the third round.

3) Poster Child Association. Once the first two rounds are established, Robert double downs on the disruptive technology and becomes the poster boy.  By associating his brand with the rapid growth, he can make claim to it's success, and will likely be invited in by the entrepreneurial team for intimate discussions and media opportunities. 

4) Break and Push.  This is the most critical phase, as it's designed to cause the maximum amount of controversy which stems rapid market discussions.  In this phase, Robert will 'game' the systems (getting the most Twitter followers, Scraping contacts in Facebook till he got pushed off, dominating friendfeed, and getting to 5000 friends in Facebook).  At this point, it becomes clear that he is the dominant player, and the community starts to resent it.  He pushes the game further till there's backlash, often resulting in Techcrunch slams, and then Techmeme fodder.  At this point the 'push' occurs where he can then use this energy to the next venture, listed in the next phase.

5) Fall off and Renew. At this stage, the climax has been reached.  Depending on adoption of the disruptive technology, Robert will either ride the growth curve for a few months, or go off to the next technology.  If the technology gets mainstream appeal, mainstream celebrities will join, pushing Robert off the top slot --at that point he must go to the next disruptive technology.

Summary: Robert Scoble is a technology influencer that has a pattern of early adoption and influencer behaviors.  He has market instinct and media savvy, and knows how to sniff and pump the next technologies.  The downside to this approach is he cannot achieve the full market benefit as he constantly must move to the next disruptive technology.  Expect Robert to follow this continual pattern over the coming years as disruptive technologies continue to occur at a faster pace.  There is only one Scoble, no one else to date has been able to achieve this effect.

So it's more enlightening to determine an ""amplification factor"" overall rather than just a viral coefficient, also known as K-factor or contagion. This is especially true with a Facebook game due to the variety of paid methods of promotion possible.

Use for v = total installs from invites / total non-paid users and then for p = total paid installs. Calculate amplification factor growth as (1/1-v)*p. P here can be total users from all non-organic invitation channels.

Dave-Larson,"Technically the viral coefficient is the contagion rate only (K-factor). But that is just one growth factor, and so people often include other growth factors in reporting.

K/virality is essentially of course how many additional users one new user will bring organically. But viral cycle time is even more important. If it takes a year for each user that invites another to do so, you will have very low growth!

Plus both factors multiply non-viral growth (e.g. paid marketing) and so it's more enlightening to determine an ""amplification factor"" overall and then factor for cycle time, i.e.:

Here's how that would look comparing K=0 on top of a sample non-viral growth rate:

Steve-Case-1,"A lot! I don't remember the total spending but do recall in the early 1990s our target was to spend 10% of lifetime revenue to get a new subscriber. At that time I believe the average subscriber life was about 25 months and revenue was about $350 so we spent about $35 to acquire subscribers. As we were able to lower the cost of disks/trial/etc we were able to ramp up marketing. (Plus, we knew Microsoft was coming and it was never going to be easier or cheaper to get market share.) When we went public in 1992 we had less than 200,000 subscribers; a decade later the number was in the 25 million range. That helped drive our market capitalization up from $70 million at the time of the IPO to $150 billion when we decided to combine with Time Warner to accelerate our transition to broadband and diversify our revenue mix.
  "
Steve-Case-1,"I am pleased that my Quora answers have been helpful to you and apparently to others as well. 

I am happy to contribute.  I signed up for Quora last Fall because I had heard about it and was intrigued.  I was initially reluctant to post answers, as I wasn't sure I wanted to add yet another social media responsibility to my repertoire.   But I jumped in the water a couple months ago and started answering some of the questions that had been posed to me.   I found it didn't take that much time, and my answers helped clarify some things (especially related to the early days of the Internet).   So I am now happy to check in every week or so, and will post when I think I can add something to the dialogue.

I have always enjoyed building and participating in the community aspects of the online medium.  Indeed, I started writing monthly ""letters from Steve"" to members of our online community 20+ years ago, and regularly posted on AOL message boards, especially in the early years.  I backed away as things got crazy, but reengaged via Twitter a couple years ago.   I run into a lot of people who I don't even know who say they get value from my tweets, and I hope the same is true with answers on Quora.  

I share the view that to whom much is given, much is expected. The Internet has been good to me (to say the least), and I am happy to give back.  My hope is that some of my perspectives might be useful to others (and in particular helpful to entrepreneurs building companies, as I want to be a champion of their efforts).  Plus, I am a sponge for knowledge, and I recognize I too can learn from participating.

Thanks for asking.
  "
Steve-Case-1,"A good place to start is to learn from Teddy Roosevelt, who said this a century ago:

""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""
  "
Steve-Case-1,"The move to unlimited, all-you-can-eat pricing was a decision that was almost a year in the making - but the final decision came together over a weekend.  

We had done a lot of testing and research in late 1994 and early 1995 and it was clear that as more consumers embraced the Internet, and as we were able to build lower cost communications networks to drive down our costs, and as new revenue streams like advertising started to show promise, and as dozens of local ISPs (Internet Service Providers) emerged with flat rate prices, that we needed to shift to unlimited pricing.    The question was when, and how.   

It was a big, wrenching change that had lots of implications, so there was a lot of internal anxiety, as well as external concern among investors, partners, etc.   It came to a head over a weekend as Microsoft announced they were offering MSN on a flat rate basis, and it was clear they were planning to steal a lot of market share from AOL.   So I decided within hours of their announcement that we had to match them, and the company worked throughout a weekend so we could make an announcement.  

When we announced the shift (to $19.95 for unlimited use), a lot of investors bailed and the stock was under a lot of pressure, and as usage soared our customers became irate about busy signals - so some of the internal fears came to pass - but despite the difficult  transition, we knew it was the right thing to do, and we never looked back.  

That pricing decision, coupled with a series of acquisitions and products to position AOL as ""the Internet and a whole lot more"" (in other words, we provided full access to the Internet plus a wide range of services that were exclusive to AOL members) led to unprecedented growth for AOL in the late 1990s.
  "
Steve-Case-1,"AOL was very successful in the 1990s in building a significant brand, audience, and market capitalization.   Indeed, a decade ago it was the most valuable Internet company and one of the most valuable companies in the world.   That enabled us to merge with Time Warner in a deal that gave AOL shareholders 55% ownership of a company that had nearly $40 billion in revenue and almost $10 billion in EBITDA.    The problem was not AOL having a large number of users - that was clearly a big advantage and asset (much as it is today for Google, Facebook, etc) - it was that the management of the combined AOL Time Warner was unable to capitalize on the opportunities that existed to innovate and build more value.   As Marlon Brando said in On The Waterfront, it could've been a contender!   But as Thomas Edison noted a century ago, vision without execution is hallucination.  That, sadly, is the AOL/Time Warner merger in a nutshell.

I saw both businesses early. I would love to be an investor in both. But as a VC you can't have FOMO (fear of missing out).

If I had done no good deals in the intervening period then there should be harder questions of me. But Maker Studios, DataSift and RingRevenue are all performing very, very well on revenue growth. And I have several other investments that I still feel are promising but not yet totally proven.

On 500px - I asked a partner to review it. He loved the product but wasn't sure how big their market would be and how tough their competition would be. Those questions still remain so just because a16z invested doesn't mean they're guaranteed to be successful. But for the record, I would much rather have 500px crush it and live with a bit of regret. They really have a fantastic product that for me as a user is 1000x better than other similar services I use.

Pros
well paid
people come tell you how they want to change the world - it's interesting
spend time on problems / companies you're interested in. don't spend time with ones you're not
no quarterly sales / revenue targets
we get paid to network
we get to go where we want to go / when we want to go*
big t&e accounts (enough said)
you don't have to manage people (the older people get the less they really aspire to do this)

Cons
we're on the sidelines, not in the game. the game is always more fun
individual, not team sport
we say ""no"" all the time. contrary to other answers - this does wear you down
it is a ""get rich slowly"" industry

And as you can see from the balance, you'd have to be a pretty big baby to complain about being a VC [that said, the comments from Anon User above are VERY spot on about how many people in the industry feel, which is why it was so refreshing to read.]

Mark-Suster,"Often VC's tell you ""keep in touch"" as a polite way of saying, ""no."" The reason they do this is that there's very limited incentive to say ""no"" outright because if you do catch a fire they don't want to have shot themselves in the foot.

My recommendation is to stay in touch with VCs whom you respect even after they say ""no"" and you will see the level of engagement they have with you.
- Do they return emails?
- Are they willing to help? (I'm surprised more entrepreneurs don't realize that VCs love to help - even when they haven't invested. Every VC you meet ought to be part of your network since they tend to know many people
- Are they willing to have occasional 15-minute phone calls?
- Will they meet periodically for coffee / updates on the business?

Most VCs WILL say ""no"" the first time. Not because they're jerks but because VC math is simple. In most larger funds each partner will do 2 deals per year. That equals a lot of ""no's.""

I wrote a guide to keeping in touch here: http://www.bothsidesofthetable.c...

And to why I believe it's vital to focus on lines, not dots (even in how you yourself pick which VC to work with):

OK, now some more info since ol' Jim Andelman called me out below!

acting as a ""class"" (e.g. the whole group of investors) seed investors will have some veto rights that are associated with nearly anybody who gives you money. these are typically over things like selling the company, raising more money, acquisitions, large expenditures outside of the biz plan, etc. They are called protective provisions
I would try really, really ... REALLY hard not to give them to individual investors separately than those acting as a class. I have done it as an entrepreneur - it is painful.
If somebody is a substantive part of the investment round, they may end up getting them by default. You have to do the math on the % ownership of the preferred stock and look at the voting thresholds in the protective provisions.

Mark-Suster,"Yes, and it's total coincidence that on the day they were suspended Twitter ran the promoted Tweet #TwitterMobile and that UberTwitter was never suspended before being bought by Bill Gross & raising $17.5m.

As a long-time user of UberTwitter I find this kind of platform behavior offensive. Not as a VC or as somebody who loves Twitter & always has. But as a user of a product Twitter chose to punish.

are they looking to become an authority on a topic?
are they looking for fame?
are they passionate about topic areas and just want to contribute?
are they looking to be entertained to get over boredom?
are they looking to make money? friends? find love?

Whatever.  But once you understand human motivations and what drives them to want to come back to the site then you can develop incentives / mechanisms to drive this behavior.  Badges are one form of this.  Leaderboards are another.  Ultimately ""keeping score"" in some ways DOES drive behavior.  I think it is one seldom talked about fascination with Twitter - your follower numbers are public.  Gulp.  Size doesn't matter? Ahem.  I think LinkedIn capping the user numbers at 500 was a terrible mistake.  Once past the threshold you have no incentive to go higher.

Mark-Suster,"Bio ALWAYS goes first and anybody who says it comes last is, well, wrong.  The most important thing a VC makes its decision on is the team.  Therefore you need to put your best foot forward. 

Additionally, you're about to talk about a bunch of cool new innovation you're working on and how you're going to change the world.  If you haven't shown the bio they're wondering the whole time ""on what basis do you have to make these claims?""

Examples: I had a very salesy guy pitching me on how he had built a world-class system to monitor & manage electricity consumption for every device in your house by a single patch at your circuit breaker and then using statistics to model which device is draining the most electricity.  The whole thing fascinated me but the whole time I thought I was talking to ""the sales guy"" and didn't know whether to believe his claims.  At the very end he mentioned he was an engineer from ...

Mark-Suster,"Always quote options to people on a ""fully diluted basis"" because that is the possible percentage they will actually own if you allocate all options.  It's the same way that public stocks often report also on a fully diluted basis because otherwise you might own less than is theoretically possible.

As a side note, in VC we often talk about ""primary"" shares (e.g. owned and therefore used to calculate voting threshold and ""fully diluted"" shares. We assume our ultimate ownership will be on the latter.

Mark-Suster,"There is no easy ""hack"" to become a good startup investor.  You first need to become a good entrepreneur (if you later want to angel invest) or join a VC firm as an analyst if you want to be junior in the industry.  But sincerely the best way is to go work at a startup for 5 years.

re: why most people are not suited to be angel investors - I wrote some posts on the topic.  See the second set of articles where the headline starts, ""for investors"" http://www.bothsidesofthetable.c...

[note - I see the tag ""angel investor"" but realize you *might* be talking about public market investing.  If so this is not relevant to you, but your question is too broad so I stuck to this narrower topic]
  "
Mark-Suster,"I don't think we can really say yet whether I'll be a successful VC in the long-run or not.  As of Sept 2010 I've been a VC for 3 years.  The average time it takes to exit an investment is 7-10 years if you're successful (12-18 months if you're not).

I divide VC into four phases:

1. Sourcing high-quality deals - This is where you build a network of people who refer deals to you and eventually it is hoped that you build enough of a reputation that entrepreneurs seek you out.  This filled my activities for my first 18 months. I'd give myself a 9/10 on ability to source competitive deals.  Only time will tell the quality in terms of financial returns but I'm delighted by the group of entrepreneurs with whom I work.

2. Working with early-stage teams / coaching / mentoring / setting strategy / rolling up sleeves - Writing checks is the easy part of VC.  That's why I always chuckle when I hear people brag about how many deals they've done.  All you have to do is be willing to pay the highest price or fund with the least diligence and you can write as many checks as you like!  But what I think separates the wheat from the chaff of investors is that some VCs turn up at board meetings and review financial spreadsheets.  Others muck in.  I'm in the latter camp.  If you like that sort of VC I think I'm a good fit for you.  If not, best not to take my money.  But I'd also say I feel I've done an 8 or 9/10 here.

3. Getting your companies to the next financing event - Inevitably as you start to make more investments and more time has passed more of your companies are going to need more money.  Raising money with them is a function of:
how good was the quality of the team, product, concept, market in the first place?
how has it developed since your investment?
how good are you at cultivating relationships with people further down the funding chain from you?
what is your reputation? do people trust you? want to work with you? believe you've backed good companies?
do you pick up the phone and dial for dollars alongside the entrepreneur or just ask them to go out and raise money and tell you when they're ready for your prorata check
Honestly, fund raising IS mostly down to the entrepreneurs / team.  But there's a lot more that a VC can do than most people know.  I'm frankly surprised how little my investors (I had 9 funds in my first company!) helped me.  I felt like I was on my own.  I swore I would never do that to the companies I fund.  I'm willing to put my reputation on the line with the entrepreneur (obviously where warranted).

The truth is that I'm just entering this phase.  Of the companies I've funded only one has gone through the next funding round (Ad.ly) and that went very well.  In the next 12 months at least four other of my investments will go through funding.  So far there has been strong in-bound demand.  But check back with me in a year and you can judge whether I've done well here.

4. Getting exits / Driving LP returns - Funnily enough I just wrote about this today http://www.bothsidesofthetable.c... - I think the best VCs help drive exits alongside their entrepreneurs.  I have done 6 VC investments - all within the past 20 months.  None have exited.  That's normal.  If they did it would be because there wasn't a huge outcome. 

But the truth is only time will tell whether I'm financially a successful VC and I'm comfortable in my skin saying that.  Any VC 3 years in saying otherwise would either be exaggerating, lucky or an extreme outlier (and obviously those do exist).

MG-Siegler,"The short answer is really simple: Tim Cook has now served as CEO of the company on three separate occasions (each while Steve Jobs was on medical leave ? including from January of this year until today when he was formally elevated to CEO). In each instance, not only has Apple survived, they've thrived.

That's fairly remarkable when you think about it. Each time, pundits have more or less said it was the end of Apple, and each time Apple ended up ahead of where they were when Jobs left. It was trial by fire, and Cook passed with flying colors. That's why it shouldn't have been surprising at all that he was next in line to be CEO.

The longer answer as to why Cook was chosen in the first place to fill-in during the medical leaves is more complicated to answer without personally knowing Cook. But I would imagine that out of all of Apple's execs, Cook is probably the most CEO-like. He commands respect because he has turned Apple's operations into the envy of everyone in the industry. No one could compete with the iPod because of Tim Cook. No one can compete with the iPad because of Tim Cook.

Jonathan Ive and Scott Forstall, both longtime execs, are also undoubtedly strong leaders. But at least up until this point, their roles have been more focused. I would guess that Forstall would be ahead of Ive in that line since Ive is known to be very singularly focused on industrial design.

What will be really interesting to watch is who takes over the more creative reins of Apple going forward. Is that done by Ive and Forstall in tandem? Does Phil Schiller weigh in? Maybe Cook is more involved in this than anyone outside the company realizes?

MG-Siegler,"Right now, it's still the Mac. The Mac has sustained Apple for far longer than any other product they've ever produced. Through good times and bad times, the Mac has lasted.

Second is the iPhone. Whereas the Mac disrupted a nascent industry, the iPhone completely turned over a massive one. The iPhone is making so much money now in a market absolutely exploding that I suspect that within a few years, it will be viewed as Jobs' crowning achievement.

Third is the iPod. This saved Apple. And it led to the iPhone and number four...

...the iPad. This could end up being number two or even number one when all is said and done. It's too early to tell. But the fact that it's already driven the number one PC maker (HP) to want to sell off their PC business, and affected the number two PC maker (Acer) in a bad way, says a lot.

Two wild cards are iTunes and the App Store. They're not traditional Apple products, but both have been extremely disruptive and have been catalysts driving the above-mentioned products.

MG-Siegler,"Who knows if it will actually be a MacBook Air, but I think that yes, it's inevitable for them to make a 15-inch Air-like notebook. (As MacRumors reported earlier: http://www.macrumors.com/2011/07...)

The reason is simple: the Air is the best computer they make, and the most recent update makes it more than powerful enough for many to buy one instead of buying a Pro (or replacing their Pro with one, as I did). When you consider that some people would like a bigger screen size, and some would like even more battery, again, I think a 15-inch thin machine is inevitable.

But again, perhaps it will or won't technically be an ""Air"". The clear movement across Apple's entire line is to forsake optical media. When Apple cuts the optical drive out of the 15-inch MacBook Pro (and I do mean ""when""), they can make it significantly smaller. Then they just need to trade the glass screen for the plastic one, and it will be much lighter. Boom - 15-inch Air-like machine right there.

MG-Siegler,"We're not just talking any old politician here, like a local city board member, we're talking the President of the United States. And plenty of other world leaders have used Twitter to varying degrees as well.

The post in question came about as I stood there in the White House watching the President take questions from people all around the country exclusively on Twitter. Then I thought about what the many people in 2006/2007/2008 who trashed the service as being pointless and something no one would ever use, would be thinking now.

The fact of the matter is that Twitter has become an extremely important service in the modern age. You can debate the degrees to which it has helped facilitate revolutionary actions, but there's no question that it has played an important role. And now it's fostering important political dialogue. What struck me most about the Twitter/White House event was the quality of the questions that came in.

That doesn't mean that Twitter has fully succeeded, of course. They do still need to figure out a viable business model that can sustain what they've built. But it would now be impossible to make the same arguments about the service that many were just a few years ago ? that it would never amount to anything. It already has.

And that's an important lesson for every startup that gets bashed for being something ""stupid"" that ""no one will use"". Sometimes it's those startups that have a chance to truly make a difference. By not fitting a mold, they can break others.

MG-Siegler,"TechCrunch traffic always dips on weekends. The overall numbers are constantly changing (rising), and there are exceptions, but generally I would say that most Saturdays see traffic that is roughly half of a normal weekday.

But it's important to note that there are two key factors here. There are less readers, it seems. But there are also less stories we post on weekend days. Still, I would bet that if we did post a full weekdays worth of posts (30-40) on a Saturday, traffic would still be down.

Sundays are typically better traffic-wise than Saturdays because people seem to start reading tech news again on Sunday night. Perhaps this is to get ready for the week or maybe it's because many companies like to time stories for this slot.

Friday afternoons, for what it's worth, are perhaps even more dead than weekends.

MG-Siegler,"To be honest, we're just trying it out. I can tell you firsthand that no deep Facebook partnership thinking went into this. We tend to do these kind of rollouts a lot with new technology when we're approached by companies and it sounds interesting.

In my view (one I know that a number of people at TechCrunch share), the core issue with comments on the web remains that the majority of people who leave them are either anonymous trolls or idiots looking to leverage your platform to draw attention to themselves.

Obviously, the level of absolutely ridiculous noise goes down quite a bit when the ability to comment anonymously is turned off. But even with something like Disqus, people can just create fake accounts. With Facebook, that's harder to do.

There are downsides, of course. We would have really liked for Twitter and Google to be a part of this ? but the sides apparently couldn't agree. So now Facebook and Yahoo are the only options. That's not ideal when people are at work and Facebook is banned, for example.

But we'll see. Is the troll trade-off worth losing those would-be commenters? Maybe, maybe not. Also, people can still easily create fake Twitter accounts, and we may have had the same issues.

But again, the core problem that no one has solved up until now is the complete and utter uselessness of comments as a site grows in size. People read Quora because it's useful. I can't remember the last time that the TechCrunch comment section was useful. But I'm sure it has been a long, long time.

But shouldn't it be useful? There's a great group of people reading everyday with a ton of knowledge. Why can't the comment section on TC be more like Quora?

I'm not saying Facebook has nailed this. And who knows, maybe we won't use it for very long. But something needs to change, and someone needs to step up with a better solution.

MG-Siegler,"I know some people think it's crazy due to the low margins, but I'm still betting on an actual TV. As in, a giant screen designed from the ground up by Apple. Obviously marked up to make it worth their time and effort.

Apple has so many ins now with component manufacturers -- including display manufacturers, that I think it's not only doable, but inevitable.

Steve Jobs has talked about how no one wants another set top box in their living room. While Apple was able to shrink the latest Apple TV so it's less of a box, it's still another separate device you have to control. I envision Apple creating an all-in-one system that simplifies the entire living room media situation.

Another reason I believe they'll do this is that consumers are willing to spend a lot of money in their living rooms. And just look at the options we have now. In terms of UI and UX, it's one giant across-the-board nightmare.

There are obviously some potential holdups here -- and they're big. The cable companies, first of all. They clearly would not want Apple anywhere near the TV set space. Why? Because it will mean the beginning of the end of their control with their awful cable boxes and over-priced content.

It could take some time. But I imagine this will come.

MG-Siegler,"It's absolutely fair. Everyone is all in a tizzy about "".X"" vs. ""X."" but Google and Apple simply (and obviously) don't view them the same way.

Does Apple roll out statues onto their lawn for each .X update? No. They don't say anything, with the exception of 4.2 because that unified the iPad with the iPhone.

Google uses their .X releases to pack in new features, new UI elements, and a ton of new APIs. Apple waits to do those until X. releases. Instead, their .X updates are mainly bug fixes.

As Adam Kazwell notes in this thread, I did point out that the only reason it perhaps was a little unfair was because 2.3 is very new. So perhaps 2.2 ? which has been around longer than iOS 4.0 ? is a better comparison then. But even that has a paltry 51.8%.

That's awful. And imagine how long it's going to take 2.3 to get there. At least 6 months. Probably more. Potentially a lot more given the current growth rate.

Obviously, most of this is not Google's fault. It's the damn carriers and OEMs. And that, in a nutshell, is the main problem I have with Android.

Long answer short, X. vs. .X is a meaningless argument. Just look at how Apple and Google treat their updates.

MG-Siegler,"Yeah, the situation is pretty gray at the moment. On one hand, you'd have to believe that Verizon/Apple wouldn't rope everyone into buying one expensive product, then turn around and launch an upgrade a few months later. Oh wait, that happens all the time :)

But really, this seems too high profile of a situation for the two companies to screw customers here. I would hope that if the iPhone 5 comes to Verizon in the Summer, there would be a heavily discounted version for customers who bought the iPhone 4 on the network.

Perhaps not the full subsidy, but maybe $100 more? Pure speculation there.

The other possibility, of course, is that the iPhone 5 will be AT&T-only at first. Though this would also be sort of a slap in the face to Verizon iPhone customers. And the latest rumors suggest the iPhone 5 could be a CDMA/GSM hybrid.

It is interesting that Apple would launch this version in February, and not just wait a few more months until the Summer (after years of waiting overall). But perhaps it's because they want to have the iPhone 4 as a cheaper alternative ($99) at that point on Verizon as well and keep things in line. Again, pure speculation there.

No matter the reasoning, I've had more than enough of AT&T and will happily jump over to Verizon the second I can.

MG-Siegler,"I'd argue that the core of fanboydom is something very simple: killer products.

When you first hear about or look at an Apple product, your first reaction might be -- ""wow, that's overpriced"". But when you actually use one for an extended period of time, you realize that part of what you're paying for really is quality. Are Apple's margins huge? Sure. But they can get away with it because more so than just the components themselves, Apple clearly puts a lot of time and thought into making their products.

Most tech products are junk that is poorly thought through and/or designed by committee. Most do some things well, but fail to nail much of the small stuff. Apple, time and time again, seems to nail the small stuff. And that instills a feeling of trust and loyalty among users.

When Apple's products weren't great -- in the 90s, for example -- they began losing this trust and the company almost collapsed as a result. Jobs came back, the products got good again, then the trust came back. Again, it's all just the killer products. That's all that matters.

If Apple made crap, it might sell quickly at first as a result of marketing, but that would quickly collapse. The notion that people who use Apple products are in some way ""brainwashed"" is laughable. And it's always put out there by people who, for whatever reason (price, prejudice, etc), haven't extensively used Apple products.

These are challenging problems and we will continue to build the best possible development team to tackle them.
Expand Quora into other languages. Most of the world does not speak English, so in order to fulfill our mission to share and grow the world?s knowledge, we need to internationalize. Our first priority is keeping English high quality as it scales up, and we have our hands full at the moment with that, so this will not happen for a bit. But it is certainly something we will use these funds for.
Scale up technically, and fund our infrastructure. Our usage is growing a lot faster than our headcount is, so as we project forward we expect that a lot of this money will go to infrastructure costs. This will mostly be EC2 bills, assuming Amazon doesn?t let Google undercut them.

In the long term, becoming cash flow positive will be important to ensuring that Quora lasts forever, so that we are not dependent on external investors. If you?re curious about how we plan to make money, see this answer. These new funds would be enough to get us to break even if we wanted them to, but we may raise more in the future if we want to invest in development more heavily. For now, we are fortunate to be able to put 100% of our resources toward sharing and growing the world?s knowledge.

Adam-DAngelo,"While I was in college I made a prototype of a chat website. I wrote the long polling server in Erlang because it seemed like the ideal language for the task and also as a chance to have fun learning a new language.

I then worked on the initial Facebook chat prototype as part of a hackathon project in early 2007, along with Anonymous and Ari Steinberg. I reused some of the Erlang code from my personal project. When we decided to make it an official project and productionalize the server code, the team decided to stick with Erlang and took over the code from there.

The rationale was something like:
We already have a working prototype to start from.
Erlang is good at holding a ton of open connections, which is the hardest part of a chat service.
Erlang is easy to learn, even though very few engineers already know it.

The last point, lack of expertise, is a real weakness of the language, but it was outweighed by other factors at the time. Ultimately it contributed to Facebook's decision to move the service to C++, though even with the knowledge that it would eventually be rewritten, I think it was the right choice for the initial version because of the limited resources we had at the time. It was probably also the right choice for WhatsApp for the same reason.

See Ben Maurer's answer to When did Facebook switch away from using Erlang for Facebook Chat? for more details about why Facebook later switched.

Adam-DAngelo,"I have had the chance to see a lot of engineers' resumes and interview performance before they were hired and gotten to see how they turned out as employees. In my experience, some of the best engineers I've worked with did not start programming until college and I don't consider starting age of programming to be a useful signal.

I don't have any quantitative data but I would suspect that on average there is a positive correlation between starting programming earlier in life and programming skill. The reason I don't think it's a useful signal is that the information in it is almost fully captured by the following two more accurate signals and it becomes irrelevant if you are good at measuring them:

How good are they at programming today? Holding everything else equal, someone who starts earlier has had more time to accumulate experience, and so they will usually be better today as a result of having that experience. But it's much better to use interviews, reference checks, etc. to judge how good someone is than to look at the age they started (or even the number of years of experience they have).
How genuinely interested are they in programming? This is not the most important signal but there is value in it even beyond #1 - it means someone will be more likely to enjoy their job and to spend time learning new things and getting better. I know people who started programming in middle school but lost interest by college. The ones who stuck with it all the way through are more likely to be genuinely interested in it. But there are also lots of people who develop an interest during college or after it. It's much more useful to try to judge current interest directly than to look at evidence from 10+ years in the past. I also should be clear that there are very good engineers who would not rank programming as one of their top 5 interests - but holding everything else equal, it helps.

Once you know how good someone is at programming and how genuinely interested they are, I think the age they started programming is complete noise. You could even look at it as a negative - if they are at this level now after having been programming for 10 years they are probably not going to be as good in a year as someone who is at the same level now after only programming for 2 years. But I'd just ignore it and focus on how good the person is right now. And I highly doubt it has an effect on long term potential.

One other thought is that I can see why first age of programming might be an outdated signal that would have been more useful in the past. Before the internet it was much more difficult to solve the kinds of obscure problems and design decisions that come up from time to time while programming, and having a lot of experience accumulated over many years was almost the only way out of this. Today with things like Google and Stack Overflow and Quora every engineer can access far more information than any ""hacker"" in the 90s could have had access to. In the past, technology changed so slowly that experience from age 13 was likely still very relevant after college. Using Lisp in the 90s was just as reasonable of a choice as it was in the 80s, but today it would be crazy. And you don't need experience to know that. You can just ask a friend or look on the internet.

Experience is still valuable but as the pace of change in technology increases and the barriers to knowledge decrease, the value of the experience decreases. That is a great thing because it opens up opportunities for more people and increases the size of the available workforce for technology companies.

Adam-DAngelo,"Protocol buffers and similar frameworks solve a set of problems that come up when serializing data.

Let's say you're writing a C++ program that keeps a log of web search query strings, along with the IP address of the user and the timestamp, written to disk. If it's a simple program you might create a simple file format with spaces separating the fields and newlines separating the records.

Now what if someone else wants to write a different C++ program to read that file? They need to write deserialization code. You can create a shared library for reading and writing data in this file format.

But what if someone wants to use Python or Java to read and write this data, to analyze the logs later? You'll need a whole set of shared libraries, one for each language. Maybe a lot of them can be wrappers around a C library and a Java library.

Then what happens when you want to add another field to the logs to store the language of the user for each query? You can come up with a new format and update the C and Java libraries, and all the wrappers for the other languages. But what about all the old data on disk that was logged in the old format? You'll need to make sure there is backwards compatibility so that all future versions of the libraries can always read the old data.

Now what if you have 50 different types of logs, to store all the other events that happen across a whole set of products, besides web search queries? You end up with 50 libraries for each language. There is a ton of repeated work here, and it's error-prone to maintain.

Protocol buffers let you declare the minimal set of information to describe the format of records in a log, and a compiler does the work of generating all the serialization and deserialization code in many different languages. At the same time, you get type safety, backwards compatibility with old versions, and lots of free optimizations.

This is similar to what a schema in a database gives you, except that you don't need to use a database to store the serialized data. You can keep it on local disk, in a distributed file system, in a remote cache, or you can use it as an RPC query.

Adam-DAngelo,"There is a very small risk, which I estimate is conservatively about as dangerous as driving in a car for 15 miles:

About 15 people per year are shocked by lightning while using water in their house in the US: [1]

Ron Holle, a former meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who tracks lightning injuries, estimates that 10 to 20 people in the United States are shocked annually while bathing, using faucets or handling appliances during storms.

About 12% of people struck by lightning are killed. Of 240 people struck by lightning in the US in 2012, 28 were killed. [2] Let's assume that rate is the same for water related strikes.

So the average number of US citizens killed by lightning during water use is about 12%*15 = 1.8. So, out of a population of 312 million in the US, there were 1.8 deaths, or a rate of 0.5 deaths per 100 million people per year.

There were about 40 ""thunderstorm days"" in an average US state in 2010.[3] This sounds high if you live in California or the northeast but the south and midwest have a lot more thunderstorms which pull the average up.

So, assuming there is one thunderstorm per thunderstorm day, the death rate is 0.013 deaths per 100 million people per thunderstorm. This is if you act normally.

Normal people wouldn't usually shower during a thunderstorm, because a) the storm usually isn't happening at the exact time when they want to shower, even on a ""thunderstorm day"", and b) they avoid showering during thunderstorms. In order to figure out how much you increase your risk by showering during a thunderstorm, we need to estimate both of these rates.

(a) to me seems reasonably estimated as the chance that a daily 20 minute period with a shower or other contact with water will overlap with a one-hour thunderstorm, my guess at the average length of a storm. This is roughly 1/24.

(b) is trickier -- how much less likely are normal people to shower or use water during a thunderstorm? I think this is somewhere between 10x and 100x. Lots of people have heard that it is dangerous to shower during a thunderstorm and will avoid it. But some storms start while people are showering, others might not be aware that a storm is happening, and others will just risk it. I'll say 50x to be conservative.

Putting all this together, you have about 50*24*0.013/(100 million) = 16 deaths per 100 million for someone who takes an extra shower during a thunderstorm.

The risk of death by driving a car was 1.1 deaths per 100 million miles traveled in 2011. [4] So, if you believe the assumptions above, the risk of death from taking a shower during a thunderstorm is about equivalent to 15 miles driven.

I am open to feedback on these estimates - respond in the comments if you think there is a better way to estimate any of the parameters.

In general, try to take some of the harder courses before you graduate. At most colleges these are things like compilers, operating systems, and computer graphics, but it varies. Though if you are a freshman, don't worry about this and just try to build up a solid foundation.
Also, take the courses you are interested in, and the ones taught by the professors you like or other students tell you they've liked. You'll do a lot better if you're enjoying what you're learning.
For Quora in particular, I'd put extra value on the following courses: compilers, operating systems, databases, machine learning, and more advanced statistics and economics courses. You can learn any of this stuff later, so it isn't critical, but it is a useful background to have.
Outside of coursework, it's helpful if you get experience writing code, through personal projects, programming contests, or internships.

Raise more if you're here for the long term and you want to protect your company from poor funding environments or hiccups in your growth. Just try to maintain control, monitor your liquidation preference, and monitor your dilution. Also understand that, if your valuation is high in this round, you will have to make a lot of progress for the next round to be an up round.

In summary, raise too little money and you may go out of business when you run into trouble. Raise too much money and you may make less dough when you exit. Take your pick: disaster vs. dilution.

In either case, try to act like you don't have a lot of money. The conventional wisdom is that when you have a lot of money, it's hard not to slow down because you start spending it (which takes time in and of itself) and you start thinking that you have a lot of time left before you die, so what's the hurry?

Okay, so exactly how much money should you raise? 12-24 months of runway is a common answer. It gives you enough time to justify a valuation bump in the next round, make a lot of mistakes, and run a few radically different experiments.

But the answer is going to change if you're pre- or post- initial product/market fit. Pre-fit, it's impossibly hard to predict when you're going to be more valuable or what you need to do to be more valuable. After fit, it's merely insanely hard.

The answer is also going to change based on your team's skill at predicting things and leading the company to hit those predictions. Most of us are probably much worse at that than we think we are. So this argues for raising more.

Babak-Nivi,"Trending is based on indications of interest from candidates and investors. In other words, when a lot of highly-ranked candidates and investors say they want to meet your startup, in a short period of time, you trend.

The rank of the person that is indicating interest matters. Rank is measured by track record: the valuation of the startups a person has invested in, founded, worked at, etc.

Trending was previously based on receiving a large number of high-quality followers in a short period of time. It has been revised to reflect more useful signals.

Trending will probably become less important once the new General Solicitation rules allow us to show featured startups to non-investors.

When is the deal closing?

Before I get into how the community answers these questions, let me say that, one, AngelList is free and, two, you can control exactly which investors in the community see your startup (http://venturehacks.com/articles...).

1. Market terms

How do I know what my shares are worth?

When you sell your car, do you go to Craigslist, or do you go knocking on doors? When you sell your action figures, do you use eBay, or do you throw a garage sale and offer your toys to one person at a time, over a timespan of 'whenever'?

You can't clear the market in series, you can only clear it in parallel. And the only way to clear the market is to go to the market. The best companies on AngelList end up raising money on better terms than they expected. It's impossible to get that outcome if you're meeting investors one-at-a-time.

2. Most value-add investors

How do I know the girl/guy I'm marrying is the best one?

Terms aren't everything. You also want investors who can add the most value. All the investors you know are probably on AngelList?but there's also a thousand other investors on AngelList that you don't know. It's highly likely that some of them have massive domain expertise in your market and you will want them involved in your company.

3. Fast

When is the deal closing?

On AngelList, you show your startup to all the investors that you want to meet at the same time. The investors know that, so they move fast. Even the investors you're already talking to know that, so they move fast. People sitting on the fence know the time for sitting on the fence is over. The best startups on AngelList start closing in days, not weeks.

For example, I remember having an idiosyncratic issue that I couldn't figure out, and Naval took a 20 minute call with me where he basically solved what two professors couldn't quite help me with (background: I was finishing up school while raising my round). The non-obvious value that AngelList has is that Nivi and Naval are like sherpas helping you scale the Mt. Everest that is fundraising."" ? Rafael Corrales, Learnboost

Summary

It's the difference between going door-to-door to sell vacuum cleaners and placing an ad on Google. One approach is a pain in the ass. The other is fast, easy, efficient.

Or think of it like this: you do everything else online, why wouldn't you raise your money online? You put your code on GitHub. You put your servers on Amazon. You buy customers on Google. You market on Twitter. And you can raise your money on AngelList.

If you have any questions about AngelList, send us an email at team-at-angel-co.

Frankly, the less you need AngelList, the more the community can do for you. That sounds surprising but it's not. The stronger you are, the better your terms will be, the better your investors will be, and the faster you'll close.

In summary, raise too little money and you may go out of business when you run into trouble. Raise too much money and you may make less dough when you exit. Take your pick: disaster vs. dilution.

In either case, try to act like you don't have a lot of money. The conventional wisdom is that when you have a lot of money, it's hard not to slow down because you start spending it (which takes time in and of itself) and you start thinking that you have a lot of time left before you die, so what's the hurry?

Okay, so exactly how much money should you raise? 12-24 months of runway is a common answer. It gives you enough time to justify a valuation bump in the next round, make a lot of mistakes, and run a few radically different experiments.

But the answer is going to change if you're pre- or post- initial product/market fit. Pre-fit, it's impossibly hard to predict when you're going to be more valuable or what you need to do to be more valuable. After fit, it's merely insanely hard.

The answer is also going to change based on your team's skill at predicting things and leading the company to hit those predictions. Most of us are probably much worse at that than we think we are. So this argues for raising more.

Babak-Nivi,"This is pretty badass. We bought a 27"" iMac for the office to build a dashboard for AngelList (http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/0...) and display Pivotal Tracker (which looks great with full screen in Chrome).

We also figured out how to set up Skype for free and easy telepresence. So someone can call our Mac and put their ugly face on the screen with absolutely no operator intervention on our end.

These instructions are for Skype for Mac 2.8. In the Preferences, turn on these settings:

""Auto-answer calls"" under Calls.
""Start my video automatically"" under Video.
""Keep call windows in front"" under Advanced (so you can see the video even if Skype wasn't the front-most window).
Set Energy Saver on the Mac to keep the display on for 3 hours (or indefinitely) ? Skype doesn't tell the Mac to turn on the display when it receives a call.
It's also not obvious how the caller can initiate a video call without making a voice call first. Here's how you do it: In the Chat window (Command-2 to bring it up), select a name from the drawer and click Video in the Toolbar at the top of the Chat window.

Some additional settings you should consider modifying:
Adjust the ""who can call me"" settings under Privacy and Video.
Turn on ""Start my video automatically"" under Video.
Turn off the screen saver entirely. When the screensaver is on, the caller can only initiate an audio call, he can't initiate a video call.
These instructions might seem complicated but you only have to set this up once.

Babak-Nivi,"Investors fall into two camps. Some think ""it's never been done before"" is a ding. Others think it's a compliment.

I'm not an investor, but I think it's a compliment. So market proof is irrelevant to me. But traction is paramount.
  "
Babak-Nivi,"Social proof is when you do something because other people are doing it. If you're walking down the street and everyone is looking up at the sky, you look up at the sky.

In this context, social proof is looking at what other investors, entrepreneurs, and advisors are doing. Customers don't count.

I'll disagree with Naval Ravikant on ""An investor is choosing not to invest in your company and is making the introduction for you"". I don't think this is as bad as he makes it out to be.

The primitive part of your brain will probably recoil when a peer sends you their rejects. But the logical part of your brain will ask why the investor is passing. And there's often a good reason: wrong market, wrong stage, wrong geography, bad chemistry with entrepreneur, some known risks that the investor doesn't want to take, etc.

Rejecting a deal just because a peer rejected it is mathematically unsound. Here's the proof. Every deal you ever invested in was probably rejected by a peer at around the same time you made the investment. So, if your criterion is that you will reject deals that peers reject, you will never make any investments.
  "
Babak-Nivi,"It's always a good time to apply. You can now continuously update your application and we'll review it every time.

Here's how I personally filter the startups:

If you've got good social proof, I'm done ? I'll make intros.
If not, then if you've got great traction, I'm done ? I'll make intros.
If not, then if you've got an awesome demo, I'm done ? I'll make intros.
If not, then if you've got a killer team, I'm done ? I'll make intros.
If not, no intros. Go back to work on your startup, improve one of these metrics, and apply again.

But those are just my personal filters. And my filters don't matter much anymore. Any of the angels on AngelList can now share deals with their followers.

Charlie-Cheever,"Palo Alto has Stanford. That's really important. You have people speaking foreign languages walking up and down the street. It means that you have access to all kinds of nice things around like the Dish, Stanford itself, sporting events at Stanford Stadium (Stanford athletics obviously, but also occasionally MLS games, etc.), and the town is liberal for a suburb. The real estate is really expensive here.

Mountain View feels a little bit 80s and kitschy to me, and mostly is populated by people who work at the big tech companies nearby like Google and LinkedIn or similar.

Redwood City has a big movie theatre which is nice and missing from Palo Alto. It feels more like a normal suburb that you find outside any city.
