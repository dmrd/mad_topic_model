Robert-Scoble-1,"Update. It's now almost a year since I got mine and I find my utility going down because Google has not yet fixed the major problems.

Voice response only works if you have a connection. Often I'm in a place, like Yellowstone, that has no connectivity.
You can only put 10 contacts into Glass, so making calls much more difficult than it should be.
You can't see, edit, or caption photos in Glass easily (only voice commands, which don't work in noisy situations like concerts). No way to automatically push photos from Glass to your smartphone, which would make it a LOT easier to edit, etc.
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter apps inadequate for really doing great posts.
No store, so getting apps very difficult.
Voice control of directions is usually good, but when it makes an error it is very hard to fix.
No live video streaming yet.
Battery life continues being too short, particularly when shooting video (I only get about 40 minutes when recording video).
Video compression is being done in software, not hardware, so unit gets hot, video isn't very high quality, and battery dies in 45 minutes or less.
Video only goes to a special part of Google+ (a new version of YouTube) and you can't easily push it to other places, like Vimeo, or your existing YouTube account.
The price is still at least twice as expensive as the most expensive smartphone and doesn't work without a smartphone. Until the price comes down I'll advise most people to stay away, especially given the lack of utility at the moment (and the risks that the UI and API's will dramatically shift this year).

There are other problems, as well, that keep it from being very useful. When I wrote the post below I thought Google would fix the problems quickly. I keep hoping fixes are coming.

I have had a Google Glass for two weeks now and they are VERY useful. Here's my review: My two-week review of Google Glass: it all depends on the?

Why? Well, just yesterday I was walking my kids around in a stroller. Both hands were on the stroller. Yet I was able to have New York Times articles read to me, I took a phone call (and made one to my wife), and I took a photo of the experience too.

This product is life changing. By the way, the Glass can NOT broadcast live to the world yet. You can shoot a video, have it uploaded to a private area on Google+, and only then can you move it over to public view from your smartphone or from inside the Glass itself.

After showing them to hundreds of people, I think the threats are mostly perception issues: if you walk into the wrong kind of bar, or a bathroom or gym locker room with them on, you might suffer consequences that won't be fun.

The big usefulness, though, is that these assist you living your life. When I got to the airport the other day it told me the gate and time of my flight. Very useful. Google Now also tells me other stuff, like how bad the traffic is on the way to work, etc. That's where the real functionality is.

Robert-Scoble-1,"Easy. Walk into any restaurant. Look at how many people are holding a mobile phone. Now consider that about a billion people are getting smartphones this year alone. Second, look at adoption rates of new things on laptops vs. mobile. Mobile is way higher. Third, look at numbers at some place like Facebook -- mobile is passing desktop usage.

I often sit next to people who use Windows PCs and I ask them ""show me something you've put on your computer that's new, loaded in the past couple of weeks."" Out of hundreds of people most can't answer that. Ask a mobile user the same thing and they'll take you on a tour of their apps ""oh, just got this Dots game, or check out the new Nest app I just got, etc etc.""

The tech press and investors care about where the market is going. Where is growth happening. Where are the most interesting, new, apps?

In my world: mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile.
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I get way more requests than I can take. Here's a few things I do:

1. I have an out-of-office message on Gmail that gives me the permission not to answer you (no answer is an ""automatic no"" the email says). Here's that email -- that lets me avoid being a jerk just by not replying:

++++++++++++++

Thank you for taking the time to write to me and I'm sorry if I don't get back to you.

I'm now getting emails at a level that I can't respond to everyone. This is an automatic response to an email you sent to scobleizer@gmail.com.

I will make a best attempt to get back to you, especially if you are sharing world-changing technology or if you are building contextual software or services, since I wrote a book with Shel Israel on that trend. Our book, ""Age of Context,"" has been released at Age of Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy eBook: Robert Scoble, Shel Israel: Kindle Store

I also am looking for best-of-breed tools to help people build companies on top of cloud infrastructure, due to my role at Rackspace.

I do read every email, but I only can reply to about 5%, sorry.

Unfortunately if I don't answer you within two or three days, it's the same as hearing ""no.""

To PR people, if you want me to cover your product you've got to give me more than one day warning.  I don't do press-release rewrites like other tech bloggers. It's best to get in touch with me at LEAST A MONTH before you launch.

If you are looking for more about where I'm publishing, or just want to have an informal chat, visit Robert Scoble | Facebook which has links to all of my blogs, and social media accounts.

Another way to get through is to talk with my producer, Rocky Barbanica. You can reach him at rocky@rackspace.com.

Thanks and sorry if I don't get back to you.

++++++++++++++

2. Have a philosophy. Mine is contextual computing is going to be more and more interesting. So, if you aren't contextual (mobile first) and using sensors, wearable computers, etc, then I will be less interested in you. This lets me say no in a nice way. ""Sorry, I'm looking for a specific kind of interaction in 2014 and you don't fit.""

3. Have a boss who makes you say no due to other interests. Boss's don't need to be employers, either. My kids and wife are in charge of my life too and demand my time the same as others do. ""My wife won't let me fit that speech into our calendar, sorry."" Or, ""my kids haven't seen me for a month so I can't make that dinner, sorry."" Works just as well as ""my boss at Rackspace already signed me up for another speech that evening, sorry.""

4. Know what you want out of life. I want to have more three-star Michelin-rated dinners. So, if you offer me one of those I'll find it very hard to turn down. I also want to see the next big company when it's just two entrepreneurs at a table. I find it hard to turn down a chance to see another company, particularly one that has an interesting new product coming out.

5. Try to be helpful in some other way. ""Hey, I can't do that interview you wanted me to do because I'm already booked this week, how about I introduce you to some other journalists who can help?""

6. Suggest ways to get to success. Those who are busy are very transactional. So, asking for coffee might get turned down, while asking to meet to pitch might not. Coffee implies some sort of squishy social agenda. ""I don't do coffee, but if you have a pitch please email me that."" Often they really just wanted to pitch you anyway and were trying to be nice by asking to buy you coffee.

7. If the person sounds interesting to at least meet, suggest meeting at an event ""hey, I'm about to head to CES in Vegas, will you be there or at SXSW in March?""

8. Be honestly busy. My calendar is 100% filled for January now. I'm very happy to show you my Google Calendar, which demonstrates that well. So, saying ""I'm booked until February and not booking new things"" works.

9. Ask them to go through someone who has an easier time saying no. For instance, I have a producer, Rocky Barbanica. He is far more willing to say no than I am. That said, if you convince him, it usually is because you actually have something great, so I'm more willing to put you on the calendar after you get through him.

10. Push them over to a social network. I do that because I want to be scalable in everything I do (answering a question on Quora, for instance, helps out potentially thousands of people, while answering a question in email only helps one person out). So, saying ""ask that question on Quora"" is a good way to turn down people. Smart people use Facebook to see when I'm online, too (I'll often chat with you there before answering my own email).

UPDATE: a friend, Loic Le Meur, turned down my request by saying simply ""I'll be on Necker Island then."" (That's the island that Richard Branson owns). I'll add that as #11: be doing something far cooler than what is being offered. :-)
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I would say that you should contact a tech journalist only AFTER you do this:

Know and follow at least 50 (I have a list of 600+ tech journalists on Twitter at Tech News People).
Make sure your startup might be interesting to the journalist in question.
Know why said tech journalist MIGHT cover you and HOW he/she might cover you (IE, have an interesting story). If I was trying to get into the New York Times, for instance, I'd read at least 500 articles written there first and I'd even start putting them into buckets. Know what bucket yours will go in.
Know how your startup is better than other companies already on the field.

Remember that, in my case, I only can accept about 1% of what gets pitched to me. I'm looking for companies who are pushing the future forward. That's vague, but not really. scobleizer@gmail.com is generally the best but phone can work too. +1-425-205-1921 -- know when I'm online and available, you can tell this from Facebook, in my case: https://www.facebook.com/RobertS...

Some tips?

Keep it short.
Explain why you are an example of how the future is changing.
Bring up anything that backs up your story (for instance, do you have a famous developer who already changed the world at, say, Apple?)
Make it easy to dive in. Do you have a blog? A video? A bunch of people talking about you on Twitter or Google+ or Facebook? A successful Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign?
Work hard on a great headline. Lots of us get 1,000 press releases a day. Think about how to stand out.
Get someone we trust to refer you. If Marc Andreessen emails me and says ""Scoble, you gotta see this new company"" you bet your bottom dollar I'll stop and pay attention.
ALWAYS carry your demo on your phone or iPad and be willing to show in weird places. Accidental PR is the best. I've found many of my favorite companies away from ""official PR.""
Be persistent, but not overbearing. Sometimes trying a second try when you have something new to announce works. I don't know why. It's just the luck of the draw. The difference between being persistent and being overbearing is a very thin line, though. Be good at listening to feedback.
If in a crowded market (photo sharing services, for instance) you better be 10x better and you better be able to demonstrate that in 30 seconds or less. Google was the 17th search engine but in just one search I was hooked and saw why it was better.

Some don'ts?

Don't mix social and business. If you want to just hang out with us and be our friend, that's OK, but don't try to ""buddy up"" just to get a chance to pitch me. Our social time is for socializing, not work.
Don't ask to pitch. The answer is ALWAYS no. Instead, ask something like ""I have a ground-breaking iPad app that is 10x better than Microsoft Office, what do you need to verify that what I'm telling you is true?""
Don't pitch us without looking at our Twitter and Facebook (even better if you use a tool like Nimble.com that shows you everything about us) . I have gotten a pitch right after I learned my mom was dying (I wrote about that online).
If you meet me in the street, don't try to pitch me unless you have some very unusual social proof (like if you are hanging out with Marc Andreessen and he verifies that what you are building is the best thing he's seen this year). I never remember these ""street"" pitches and they rarely are any good anyway. Instead, introduce yourself, and ask for our email so that you can pitch us professionally.
Don't pitch us on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Email is best for a whole lot of reasons (at least in my case). If you do pitch us there you'll get instructions to pitch us on email (mine is scobleizer@gmail.com ). I hate these social pitches because I can't easily search for them in the future and I often don't have time to answer everyone everywhere so focus on my email first.
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"I always want to be on the bleeding edge, or, more accurately use tools that are ""best of breed."" For the past seven years that was Apple's iPhone which is, still, arguably the best mobile ecosystem out there. Apps still ship on iPhone first (generally) and when I look at tech passionate people most of them still have iPhones and iPads.

That said, things are switching. Read Paul Stamatiou, designer at Twitter, about his experiences with Android: Android is better I agree with all his points.

My view started shifting last year when I saw a new series of trends that, bundled up, bring us contextual computing (I'm writing a book on those trends with Shel Israel, titled ""Age of Context"" that will come later this year).

Most of the apps in this new field are on Android first because of Android's more open approach. A great example is Everything.me - Introducing the Dynamic Phone TM, which is my favorite app switcher. It can change nearly everything about the phone and hook into all your apps, even. Things that are impossible for developers to do on iOS.

These new contextual apps, including Google Now, got me to look at Android in a new light. No longer was it an uglier cousin of iOS but was bringing very real innovation to bear.

Then, when Google Glass came out, my mind totally switched. I was  one of the first in line at last year's Google IO conference to lay down $1,500 for my own Google Glass (I've been wearing them every day since April 16, 2013).

Google Glass is a real game changer. No other consumer electronics device knows where I'm aimed, where I'm looking, and has such a consistent access to my context through the sensors inside.

Of course it works better with Android (it runs Android 4.0.4 inside). So that pushed me to make the switch.

Later, Moto X showed me that there's yet again, more innovation coming on the Android side of the fence (you can't talk to your iPhone without touching it first), but on Moto X it just listens for you to say ""OK Google Now."" Since it is illegal to touch a phone while driving, both Glass and Moto X are big deals for me since I drive 1.5 hours every day to the Rackspace Studio in San Francisco and back.

That all said, I still have an iPad and am watching the Apple ecosystem closely. Most users won't follow me, there aren't enough advantages -- yet. But with Paul's note, and my observations, there is something happening on the Android side of the fence and I think it'll become more obvious next year that Android has taken the innovation crown away from Apple (and everyone else).
  "
Robert-Scoble-1,"It's expensive because the ones that are being distributed now are prototypes that are being built one-by-one.

I expect that when they are released to the public next year they will be somewhere around $200 to $300. The build-of-materials is somewhere around $100, when you look at all the components. Of course that doesn't cover the millions of dollars spent in R&D and in acquiring people, like Thad Starner, to come and build them.

Some reasons they are so expensive (this isn't the first time a company has charged a lot for developer prototypes -- the Xbox prototypes were about the same price):

Supply and demand. They can only make a few hundred per week at this point. So, having a low price wouldn't make sense. When you have very little supply and a lot of demand, raising the price is perfectly reasonable.
Making sure that the best people get them first. If I were Google I'd want mostly developers to have them at this point so that there'd be some apps when they are released early in 2014. Developers see the value in building companies and products to target a new platform. Paying $1,500 to build something like Instagram won't seem significant in three years if the business is successful. Most other people won't see the value in paying $1,500 for an unproven new gadget.
PR reasons. If you spend $1,500 for a pre-release prototype you know what you are getting into. You'll likely give a lot of feedback to Google. You'll likely understand the limitations (there are MANY app holes right now, for instance) and forgive those. Regular people, if they got them at this point, wouldn't understand those limitations and would complain about them on Twitter and Facebook, etc.
Anyway, I think this is a short term problem. By May most people will be able to buy them and I can't see a reason that Google would charge more than $500 for them (and I can see many that they would want to make them very low cost, like $200).
  "
Evan-Williams,"Another reason it became standard to break an article up is because it increases the number of pageviews and, thus, ad impressions.
  "
Evan-Williams,"I can't think of one.

All the companies mentioned here either:

a) *Did* have significant revenues:
Netscape (the same company as Mosaic, btw) made $400M in revenue the first 9 months of 1997: http://sec.edgar-online.com/nets...
Geocities (This is a guess, but I bet that traffic made Yahoo! a boatload of money back when banner dollars were easy to get. Maybe not enough to justify the $3.5B acquisition price, but that wasn't the question. Anyone know?)
Shutterfly (see comment above)

b) Didn't really have a lot of users. (What's ""a lot"" anyway?)
4chan?

c) Got bought, ran out of funding due to dot-com crash, or sued out of existence before they tried in earnest to monetize. None of these are the same as ""failing"" to monetize.
Geocities (Even if not really in category A under Yahoo's regime, they are here.)
Almost everyone else mentioned

Possible exceptions (don't really know the story on either of these, but I doubt it):
JenniCam (was she a company?)
DejaNews (did they have any users?)
Ning (I think they were growing well for a while, not sure what happened exactly.)

Having a large number of users and the inability to monetize them is a non-existent problem. People talk about it all the time, but it doesn't really happen?at least it doesn't happen in today's world. I'm not even sure it ever did. Sure, there were Internet companies that went out of business because they were losing too much money, but I think usually they didn't *really* have a lot of users (just a lot of hype) or they had out of control costs.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"My job is to find the binary projects (like Uber) that most folks don't understand until they change the world. I was in the first round of Uber because when I saw just one taxi on Travis' iPhone and his passion it was clear to me that he would scale it to thousands.... of course, I would be lying if I said I saw it getting to where it is today (much more than thousands) as quickly as it has.

Yoga and $4 coffee are examples of crazy trends from the 80s that have become something almost everyone has either tried or participates in. In 1987 the idea of spending $3 on a .25-.50 cup of joe was insane.



The idea of bankers and lawyers doing yoga in 1986? Also absurd... but now it's not uncommon to see 15 to 70 years olds in the same yoga class! It's 100% normal.

Meditation? Seems strange to some, until they do it and have a massive, life changing event. Which it has been for me and countless others.

If you want to know if this will work, get the 1.0 of the App and spend $10 for the yearly pass. Do it 10 days in a row before you go to bed.

If you don't feel you got your money's worth I will hand you a $10 bill.

note: there is still a 70% chance that a startup like Calm.com will fail... that's just math/historical trends. Of course, I think it has a 70% chance of being a $100m+ business that will get my investors 10-25x their investment.

  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"You should talk directly with the owner of the businesss if you have this much leverage, and you should center your ""package"" around getting close to that individul.

As a developer you will have a ton of options--that's not what is important in startup life. Being as close to the founder, the investors, the board and the decision making process is the place you want to be.

So, if it was me I'd say:

1.  In terms of pay I'd like to have whatever the difference is between the top developer on the team and the CEO -- even if it is lower. (i.e. CEO takes $100k, top developer gets $130k you take $115k).

2. That you get a stock package that is 2x the current best developer OR what the stock package would have been if you joined in the A round (i.e. time machine). You can say ""if i suck you fire me and I lose it all due to the 1 year cliff).

3. Most important: I will only take the job if I get to have a 1-on-1 lunch with the founder 2x a year and we put it on the schedle now--because I want to learn and understand the business deeply.

This puts you in the ""massive team player"" and ""close to the crown"" categories... which is really where you want to be.

4. Finally, max cash is bullshit in our industry. There is always more money somewhere, and after $1XXk you're life isn't much difference (the beach in fiji, maui and mexico is the exact same... just 10x the price difference). So, optimize for the BEST TEAM and BEST PRODUCT and BEST MISSION. That will give you the most joy and happiness.

5. Loyalty: be a loyal melon farmer always... too many people get caught up in cash and the shinny new objects. like relationships, the best ones are built through the tought times. Stick with a great leader and team for 2-5 years.... because all the good stuff is in year 3, 4 and 5 of a project. Years one and two are just slogging generally.

At that time I invested my LAUNCH Ticker [ LAUNCH ] had been publishing for months. The ticker is similar to Circa, as both are curating. Ticker was publishing for months before Circa. Of course Matt was working on the idea for Circa long before I launched the LAUNCH Ticker (he told me, I believe that).

We decided the ticker was not competitive. We had not talked about Inside, because we were keeping it stealth.

Now, Inside is obviously MUCH more broad that the ticker and overlaps with Circa in that we are both 'mobile' and 'news,' however Circa is journalism and we are not.

Inside is never going to do journalism, we are sticking to curation.

This means we will be (and have been) linking to Circa's awesome journalism.

One way to look at the two product is Circa is a better New York Times and we are a better Google News.

In another 10 years I think folks will look at see these apps as cable channels and magazines, at which time it will be very obvious that consumers want to use at least a half dozen of them.

There is no specific devices other than a standard stock plan at work. Mahalo went sideways for two years so while it might not be the ground, ground, ground floor, but the cap table makes it still a relatively ""new"" startup. Also, you can increase the # of options a person has to make up for things like the amount of capital raised and the valuation (obviously).

Also, a lot of folks from the mahalo era didn't execute their options (intelligently in a way since it wasn't looking very good their for a bit -- especially after Matt Cutts and Google decided we didn't deserve to exist and took all our traffic ), so there was a large % of the option pool still available.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I don't see any collusion as an angel on, and one of the top five members of, AngelList.

I've never seen any collusion in four years of doing this / 40 + investments and the formation of a $10m angel fund (the Launch Conference fund).

Of course, I put $50-250k into startups and I typically don't lead the round (yet!) and set the terms. That being said, great founders with great startups in a hot market like this are setting the terms.

It's a game of chicken, and I watched top firms not be willing to pay for Twitter, @facebook and @uber at A and B rounds that now look cheap. As a founder if you are setting the terms and you can't get them you'll know quickly, as folks will say ""whoa... a $15m cap on a 10 week old @ycombinator company seems a little high no?""

Then the market corrects a little. The best thing to do is to talk to a LOT of folks and get a marketplace going for your startup... then pick highest quality partner at the highest quality firm, as well as the most helpful angels with the best reputations (angel list is the best place to start checking this fyi... their recommendations feature is KILLER and verified).

Inside is in private alpha right now and will start private beta later this month. It's the greatest product i've ever built, and I predict it will be the largest content site in the world, eventually beating Wikipedia (10 years from now).

It takes everything we learned in human curation from Mahalo, as well as the passion from Weblogs Inc. (i,.e. Engadget, Autoblog, etc)  and combines it with other projects I've done into what will be the most important news platform ever created. yes, more important than the nytimes and CNN, but without competing with them.

On that note, the SEO business is dead.... Google is taking the second and third click from everyone. I tried for a year to rebound from the Google Panda update, talking to Matt Cutts personally, as well as the most senior folks at Google. They gave me the runaround and I gave up.

Matt Cutts treated me like a dog after 10 years as a partner. I'll never do business with him again. Any content business that partners with Google is really risking their lives.... they don't care about anything but their own growth. They are going to kill or dominate all content companies that partner with them.

After 10 years as a google partners, having generated over $20m in adsense revenue, I basically realized Google is no longer interested in being a partner to content creators. Google wants to dominate content partners and replace them.

If you are in the content business Google is the enemy sadly. They are category by category killing content companies: comparison search, flight/travel data, sports data, general reference (wikipedia, mahalo, ehow) and of course all video.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"The Grand Jury selects the prize winners at the Launch Conference (festival). The audience participated last year with the world's first live-crowd funding app: I Wonder If Live Crowdfunding Works? Let's Find Out! - LAUNCH -

of course, we couldn't actually move $ around due to the Crowdfunding laws not being ready. Now that the Securities Exchange Commision has released more guidance around crowdfunding I think things will get even more interesting.
  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"Very.

My angel fund, the LAUNCH Fund, is planning to invest in 50-100 startups over the next five years.

Our average size investment will be $50-250k.

I now have $300k+ in syndicates. I predict it will eventually reach $500-1m per deal.

Next month I will invest $200k in a startup I love and my syndicates will join me for $300k.

We will be the lead investor in this round.

Previously I was < 10% of any given investment round--typically 5% of the round. Now I'm going to be between 33--100% of the round.

That's a huge difference.

I can now get founders fully funded and off to the races and I don't need to ask anyone for help. I don't have to ask anyone for permission.

VCs take weeks to get their partners to agree on a deal. I take a hours to a couple of days to decide.

So, this changes everything. The bottom half of VCs--the ones who don't really provide a lot of extra value--are going to find themselves never getting to the best deals.

It won't impact Sequoia Capital (VC Firm), Benchmark, Accel Partners or other top tier firms--as they provide massive value.

Frankly, my game gets better as the stakes get higher because i'm not board like i am at a $100-500 game. I see this a lot with folks, so i generally like to play with billionaires at $10k buy in games. :-)

I never play above my stakes, i never drink and play and i made it to #1,000 out of 6,700 at the WSOP main event.

To be a *great* player you need to do it full-time i've learned. it's really about getting into a certain zone over 30-50+ hours a week. i only have 10-20 hours a month to put into my game.

when i retire i might play more full time... it's an awesome sport.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I've heard that a bunch of times. I didn't start these things to create an incubator, I started them because they were personally interesting to me... my passion is startups, media, technology and entrepreneurship. That being said the two big winners are:

a) This Week in Startups: 300 episodes, $500k a year in revenue next year, great guests, great fans, 100k+ downloads.

b) LAUNCH Festival: millions raised at the event, five years already, amazing alumni from Mint to fitbit to yammer to spacemonkey and more.

right now i'm so busy with Mahalo (soon to be Inside.com), that I've ""contained"" the scope of the two ""side projects"" to one yearly event and twice a week for the show.

Maybe after Inside.com I'll do an incubator or some sort, but I like to build so if i did that it would have to be more like Science or Bill Gross and Idealab.

Thanks for asking!

PS - This year I set two challenges for myself with LAUNCH (March 4-6th 2013):

1. have the startups raise $10M+ from angels and crowdfunding (if legal at the time). More here: I Wonder If Live Crowdfunding Works? Let's Find Out! - LAUNCH -

2. Have the largest event ever filled with people who make stuff. 2,000 seats in the theater and 5,000 tickets to the event issued. How? I'm giving away scholarships to developers, UX and designers here: Free Ticket to the LAUNCH Festival - LAUNCH -

almost 1k signed up in the first day... and we're checking them... they're actually real developers, designers, etc.

Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I'm using 15Five to ""review"" employees on a weekly basis. Review in quotes because it's really a feedback tool that starts discussions around core issues.

My perception is that yearly reviews are not in line with expectations of Gen-Y team members. Heck, even Gen-X folks always wanted more frequent reviews... we were just not vocal about getting them.
  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"I've played the Main Event three times and came in the top 50% the first two times (day two), and in the top 15% the last time (day three).

1. There is a wide range of players in day one. Complete donks and pros and everything inbetween.

2. You start with 30,000 chips and 50-100 blinds. So you have 300 big blinds. The levels are two hours long. Most tournaments are 30-60 minute levels and 10k chips. That means there is no reason to be going all in during day one. You have to be selective.

3. Day two you have half the field gone, which means that your table composure goes from 1/3rd pros to 2/3rds+ pros. What table you get on day two matters, both in terms of who and how many chips they have. You might wind up at a table with multiple people with 150-250k chips, or just one--or none. You might have seven pros or three.

4. Day two you have to really start keeping up because there are antes and the levels are fast.

5. It is grueling. You play five, two hour levels a day. That's 10 hours of poker starting at noon and ending at 1AM+. You have a couple of breaks and dinner for 90 minutes.

6. It's a pool of bacteria and foul bathrooms. I have a secret VIP bathroom I use, and I wash my hands constantly. Even with that you will get sick after the event or during it. HAve a ZPack ready.
 
Overall it's a blast, people play very tight and you play very few hands. People are laying down sets on the flop, or Kings or Queens pre-flop all the time.
  "
Jason-McCabe-Calacanis,"Couple of points here:

1. The network effects of markets will mean there will be only two viable players in this space.

2. One will be AngelList--hands down. No one will take that slot from them, and their valuation is already significant according to sources.

3. That leaves one other slot. That slot would instantly be filled by KickStarter if they want to take it. They told me they won't do it--but I don't believe them. This is an easy thing to add and their users will demand it.

4. I don't have inside information, but it's a lock that SecondMarket--the best run secondary market in the world--will dip down to this level for the feeder effect of it.

5. If you can buy shares in those three startups I would do it (I am about to close on shares in one of them). All three will be multibillion dollar businesses in five years.

6. I've never heard of Gust.com or received a deal from it. I'm the #3 user on AngelList.

7. This is a really dumb comment: ""once a company goes down the crowdfunding path, they will effectively be cutting themselves off from any future funding by deeper-pocketed Accredited Investors."" Any company with hyper growth, a great team, a great market or some combination of those three will INSTANTLY get funded on AngelList.

8. There isn't going to be any money to be made in crowdfunding. A 5% take isn't enough to really cover all the expenses around this. As such, I think folks like AngelList who don't care about making money--but rather creating impact--will take this space over. AngelList doesn't charge anything right now and they only care about quality. I know Naval, he's a driven, principled guy who is not in it for the money. He's going to disrupt the space and build a next-gen LinkedIn.

For me the name of the game is to GET THE PUBLICS money to create great products. That's how I'm thinking. The marketplaces are already set... no one will get past SecondMarket, Kickstarter and AngelList. It's already over.

I think this was somewhat innovative, but in truth many of my ideas came from DAUM.net and naver in Korea. I just got them to America before everyone else.

I think the work we're doing in iPad apps will be a bigger win than the search product which got us to the 140th largest site on the internet, millions a year in revenue and 15m uniques in a month (ahh... the pre-Panda days of SEO when you could invest in content on the web and get traffic consistently from Google).

Dave-McClure,"as jeff notes, typical fund investors tend to be institutional, corporate, or family office groups (collections of rich people), as well as high net worth folks (individual rich people).

some of the more successful & well-known micro-VC funds raise from the same sources as larger VC funds, however since most of us haven't been around very long (<5 years) and start out with smaller funds (<$50M), it's difficult to raise money from traditional VC investors because of our limited track record, and because they can't / don't write checks smaller than $5-10M. they may also have max ownership restrictions where they can't be more than 10-20% of the capital in any one fund.

in any case, 500 Startups first fund started out with a mix of individuals (lots of friends we knew from PayPal, Google, Facebook, YouTube, Linkedin, Twitter, etc), corporate investors, and some VC funds / individual partners. gradually as we have gotten more established & raised larger funds, we have begun aiming for larger investors from more traditional sources.

however, we still have a large # of small investors who helped us get started early, and we appreciate them a hell of a lot. in particular, some high-profile VCs & entrepreneurs were kind enough to write us small checks in the beginning, which helped us a LOT to get off the ground & legitimize us to other investors.
  "
Dave-McClure,"aS
  "
Dave-McClure,"all these answers are nonsense & mathematically flawed. it has absolutely nothing to do with returns.

the reason is because they want to hold board seats in the company, and have controlling stakes in governance.

there is *NO* good logic behind VCs taking 20% of individual companies in order to generate returns. they could take a lower % of more co's, or a higher % of fewer co's, and still achieve target returns (altho note that most do not).

more likely, the 20% ownership target is  practical for traditional VCs that aim to hold board seats -- given most companies only have 3-5 board seats in the earlier years, it would be difficult to obtain and/or defend a board seat without owning a proportional amount of preferred shares of the company that the board seat represents. thus, a 20% target stake would be enough to both 1) acquire and 2) keep a board seat where there might be a small # available.

this is the only rational explanation why VCs aim for some arbitrary ownership %, other than most people simply repeating this as an industry best practice, without having the faintest idea why or how it came about.

if someone has a better reason I'm all ears, but I haven't heard any persuasive argument in the past decade or more I've been involved in the business.

(people tend to copy what others have done in the past, without investigating whether the past was any good ;)

for the record: 500 Startups does not believe this is the only viable strategy for good VC fund performance. in fact, we believe a larger sample size (>100) of co's in early-stage portfolios is a much better strategy for improving returns, and we generally do not care much about taking board seats nor ownership %... however we *DO* care about valuation, and we believe investing early at lower cost will give us a better shot at good returns.
  "
Dave-McClure,"well, at least for many small funds the 2% part of 2-20 doesn't usually work so well... or at least, spreading it out over 10 years doesn't work well. note that most funds operate for ten years, and charge fees for most if not all of those years.

many small funds (including ours) structure fees so that they happen earlier in the fund life cycle, when most of the work (& costs) related to executing the fund investments happen.

for example: in our first fund, we had a front-loaded fee schedule that started at 3% for the first two years, then decrements 0.5% every two years, ending up at 1% for the last two years.

In our most recent fund, we actually reduced fees overall to only 1.5% average for 10 years, but made fees 3% for the first two years, then 2% for the next two years, then only 1% for the next four years, and ending with only 0.5% for the last two years.

for more info on how 500 business model works, see my previous Quora answer here:
Dave McClure's answer to 500 Startups: What is 500 Startups' business model?

I've also heard other funds may charge a flat rate amount that is collected at the beginning of the fund life. note that this might be risky if the fund manager runs out of money too quickly, and doesn't have enough left to finish executing the fund strategy.

in any case, small funds will very often have higher expenses on a percentage basis than large funds, particularly early in the first few years of fund life, and thus might need to consider other fee strategies than just the standard 2% for ten years.

ultimately, altho percentage-based fee structures have been a historical industry standard, a budget-based fee structure that is matched to the actual timing of fund expenses probably makes more sense.

at 500 Startups, we have had to be creative in coming up with other revenue sources than just depending on management fees in order to cover our costs. this has worked well for us, and has resulted in us charging less in fees and not depending as much on fund size to drive our budget.

Jeremiah-Owyang,"A Breakdown of the Scoble Effect in Five Phases.

First of all, I've been watching Robert closely for over 6 years. I knew him when he was the chief blog evangelist at Microsoft, at his book launch party at Techcrunch's backyard and went to work with him at PodTech for a year.  We're still very much good friends and our families enjoy time together.  Yet while I know him well, I'll give you the straight truth on how he does it.

It's part of my job (and inquisitive behavior) to break things into small pieces and look for patterns, and I'll do that for this influencer.  I am an Industry Analyst and have devoted my career to studying this space, watching influence patterns is a key part of the role.

Scoble has a cyclical pattern to all disruptive technologies that break down in the following process.  I've seen him do the following for Blogs, Twitter, LiveStreaming, Facebook, Friendfeed, FourSquare, Cinch, and most recently, Quora.

1) Going Wide on the Market. First of all, he places 'bets' on most disruptive and new technologies, also known as the ""shiny syndrome"".  This is his very difficult to do, since it requires him to be constantly on the ground, his show helps him to meet all these young startups while they are still in their garages.

2) Prime and Pump. While most of his bets never take off, some do, he can 'feel' the signals from other early influencers and then starts to pump the market.  He can do this in a combination of tweets, or blog posts.  Expect his blog posts to say ""Why I love X"" and then later a contrasting post ""Why I hate it"" or ""Why I was wrong"".  This leads to great controversy which sets up for the third round.

3) Poster Child Association. Once the first two rounds are established, Robert double downs on the disruptive technology and becomes the poster boy.  By associating his brand with the rapid growth, he can make claim to it's success, and will likely be invited in by the entrepreneurial team for intimate discussions and media opportunities. 

4) Break and Push.  This is the most critical phase, as it's designed to cause the maximum amount of controversy which stems rapid market discussions.  In this phase, Robert will 'game' the systems (getting the most Twitter followers, Scraping contacts in Facebook till he got pushed off, dominating friendfeed, and getting to 5000 friends in Facebook).  At this point, it becomes clear that he is the dominant player, and the community starts to resent it.  He pushes the game further till there's backlash, often resulting in Techcrunch slams, and then Techmeme fodder.  At this point the 'push' occurs where he can then use this energy to the next venture, listed in the next phase.

5) Fall off and Renew. At this stage, the climax has been reached.  Depending on adoption of the disruptive technology, Robert will either ride the growth curve for a few months, or go off to the next technology.  If the technology gets mainstream appeal, mainstream celebrities will join, pushing Robert off the top slot --at that point he must go to the next disruptive technology.

Summary: Robert Scoble is a technology influencer that has a pattern of early adoption and influencer behaviors.  He has market instinct and media savvy, and knows how to sniff and pump the next technologies.  The downside to this approach is he cannot achieve the full market benefit as he constantly must move to the next disruptive technology.  Expect Robert to follow this continual pattern over the coming years as disruptive technologies continue to occur at a faster pace.  There is only one Scoble, no one else to date has been able to achieve this effect.
