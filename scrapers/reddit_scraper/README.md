reddit scraper
===

These scripts scrape reddit for comments.

Usage:

    python scraper.py [user name]

where [users name] is a reddit username.

The file [top_karma_users.txt](top_karma_users.txt) contains usernames for the users with the most reddit karma (comment, link, well-rounded, and combined), according to [Karma Whores](http://www.karmawhores.net/). 

__Note__ : These results are really bad, so discontinuing this scraper's development. -- Shubhro
