"When I was in eighth grade, a girl two grades up from me was writing a novel. I didn’t know much about her aside from her name, the fact that she was my classmate’s older sister, and that she was in the finishing stages of creating a work of fiction, but I wanted to become her, cut my hair short and type importantly on my laptop in my small school’s even smaller library. That she was profiled in my school’s newspaper as well as Chicago Magazine was not nearly as interesting–she had done what I believed to be impossible and I revered her for it. She bridged the gap between learning about what good stories were and actually writing them, ascending the ranks of moody authors in moody sweaters staring from book jackets like lacquered doors.,I followed her through English classes, through poems and publications. I discovered she was an editor and writer for Polyphony H.S. (a high school literary magazine founded by my high school English teacher Billy Lombardo). I later submitted some of my own work to Polyphony and applied to be an editor in my own right, hopping quickly into the divots in the Young Adult Writer trail she left.,In retrospect, I think other adventurers in Internet-based world of teenage creative writing might have shared a similar obsession with creative accomplishment. These others, eager students guided by aging and wise professors. Their egos, their enthralling successes. We all fixated on a sequence of competitive gains to equal success in creative writing, and found each other in cyberspace. People I would meet in writing workshops at Kenyon College and Iowa Young Writers Workshop, people I would hear about in the appendices of high school literary magazines, people whose poems I would edit and who would accidentally forget to make their manuscripts anonymous. Through Facebook and spider webs of college acceptances, I am connected to hundreds of self-proclaimed Young Writers.,Picture this:,You have arrived on the wide green lawns of a small liberal arts college (insert: Kenyon, Sewanee) and it is marvelously and absolutely summer. The trees swoon with deep green leaves and from the airport shuttle bursts forth a hundred other writers your age. About seven percent have packed ukuleles in their bags. Thirty percent consider David Foster Wallace to be their favorite author. You know that these people are the people you have been waiting most of your life to meet, people you’ve believed existed beyond the confines of your small provincial high schools and science-minded families. You spend the next two weeks becoming fast friends with most of the people you meet (in workshops, in impromptu circles on the grass), writing experimental poetry and gently critiquing the work of your peers. You call yourself a Writer because the program does.,We all know who we are because we have defined ourselves as such; we wouldn’t have gotten to know each other had we not dubbed ourselves Writers first. This world is closed to those who do not look for it—those who have not boasted to others and our parents, who do not posses the terrifying hubris that accompanies triumphing over puberty and being moderately commended for talking about ourselves, those who have not filled out the summer program applications. I wonder if I would have known about this world were I more talented and less proud of it.,Let me give you glimpse.,In this brave new world, poetry is a prize to be won. High school senior Amanda Silberling, Managing Editor and co-founder of Winter Tangerine Review and poetry editor for The Adroit Journal, shares the same reserve. “The ‘teen writing culture’ is helpful and supportive for the most part,” she relayed to me through email, “but if you aren’t careful, it can be toxic. When people get sucked into ‘teen writing culture,’ it’s not uncommon at all for them to lose track of why they write– no one decides to start writing so that they have something to brag about via Facebook status. I’ve heard people unironically use the phrase ‘competitive writing,’ or compete to see who can publish the most work in a set timespan[…] Sometimes, teen writing culture makes it seem like rejection is fatal and success is mandatory.” The question becomes not is this poem doing something new and exciting, but instead is this poem good enough to get published. An atendee at the Kenyon Review Young Writer’s Workshop in 2010, Silberling is not impervious to the accomplishment-driven culture; the accolades in her title denote her as some kind of young writer royalty. If this pre-professional creative writing world were a kingdom, University of Pennsylvania freshman and creator of The Adroit Journal, Peter LaBerge would reign as king. “I created The Adroit Journal in November 2010 as a sophomore in high school because there was nothing like it at the time,” Peter said via interview. “I was submitting to places like The New Yorker and Poetry, and not feeling like my work was being given serious consideration. I wanted to create a publication where eager college and high school students like me could be given the support and affirmation that they deserved.” LaBerge agrees with Silberling regarding the pre-professional nature of “competitive creative writing,” stating that “The ‘professional’ (I hesitate to use that word) emerging writer culture is an intensely sink-or-swim environment, governed by publication and recognition opportunities.” In this world, publication has become something of a tally game. On his resume alone, LaBerge sports publications from magazines such as PANK, Polyphony H.S, ,If this laundry list of lit mag name-drops seems professional, it’s because it is. Most literary magazines require a cover letter for submission, and for small, indie presses, the more you’ve been published can’t hurt. That is not to say that all publication is sought for pre-professional purposes; unlike athletics and mathematics, writing does not present itself with a clear manner of defining success. Beyond the classroom, publication is a writer’s way of knowing she has done something right.,Writing is not the only creative field that has taken a turn for the pre-professional. The New Republic recently declared that “ballet is in crisis because it’s turning into a sport,” citing the increased popularity of ballet competitions like Youth American Grand Prix and their influence on dancers becoming accepted into prestigious ballet companies as something that has contributed to a phenomenon: “a,When people write poems, they write to explain why the trees look different after the loss of a lover; why they feel their ankles differently; how the asphalt smells after the snow melts. Professional writers are also writing to make a living and to pay rent. But when those are not factors, and college and Internet reputation become forces of importance in the competitive culture of this current crop of young writers. These days, it is not enough to write well and powerfully. As Silberling states, “we’re all very passionate about the arts and want to pursue careers as writers, but of course, it’s extremely difficult to work in the arts for a living, and we all know that.” The competitive nature of creative fields is not new. Only online, we can all see where we fall behind.,We are all connected through our mutual ambition, following the fever dreams of our own prose, trying to break past the boundaries of young people who have written before us. We are proud enough of our own accomplishments that we felt compelled to enter ourselves into this strange subset of creative culture. We want to write work we are proud of. All of us, brave and cocky adventurers spitting in the faces of parents who told us that writing would never get us anywhere. We have accolades. We create our own prizes. We have manufactured creative writing into a unit of success that can be quantified. We try to placate our growing pangs with poetry prizes, combat uncertainty with gold keys.,But, as Silberling reminds us: “Writing isn’t like that. Life isn’t like that. I want my generation of writers not to forget that writing is an art. If you’re in it for the resume boost, you’re in it for the wrong reason.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/competitive-lit/,"

"We sit by the window, eating Chobani with rigid, robust, black C-store spoons.,“Did you know Chobani was actually founded by a Turkish dude?” I say. She is Greek, and I know some of the tumultuous regional history, but I am still surprised to see her eyes well with tears.,“Yeah. Pretty terrible,” I add a moment later. I look at the floor. “Let’s not finish these.”,The next day I notice my table covered in what appear to be shards of translucent glass. I look closer, and they glisten, as if alive. The ice-like pellets are scattered beside the half-filled containers. The Chobani left over on the aluminum tops had hardened, fallen, and broken up into unrecognizable fragments.,**********,I was introduced to Fage by a friend. I don’t think he realized at the time how special it is. I couldn’t say then just what it was either, but I was smitten, responding, I think, to the yogurt’s blinding, simple coherence; pert, perfectly split into symmetric, radial orange-like slices, complemented by a semi-cylindrical pouch worn by a caring mother nature comforting you with the delicately sweet fresh fruit of her womb.,**********,Fage was founded in 1922, in Greece. The American container announces that it is the #1 selling yogurt in Greece, near where it tells you that the name is “pronounced: Fa-yeh!” as if it must be exclaimed. Chobani was founded in 2005, in upstate New York. The “history” section of Chobani’s Wikipedia page says, “Chobani has been the beneficiary of the growth of Greek-type strained yogurt (known as ‘Turkish’ yogurt outside the United States).”,The comment about Turkish yogurt does not seem unrelated to the warning at the top of the Wikipedia page letting readers know that “a major contributor to the article appears to have a close relationship to the subject.” I find myself irritated, suspicious that the indignity of what amounts to highly remunerative cultural appropriation by a gauche, inferior product is being masked via exploitation of Wikipedia’s editorial permissiveness. I do some quick research: a Google search for “Greek yogurt” returns 2.2 million hits; “Turkish yogurt” returns 30.4k hits. I try in Spanish: “yogur Griego” returns 29K results, “yogur Turco” gets 7K. I try in Chinese:”希臘酸奶 ” gets 43K results, “土耳其酸奶” gets 12K. In Turkish, the results are similarly skewed.,I return to the site five days later. The sentence is gone. I check the page’s revision history to make sure I’m not crazy. Two days before, IP address 66.65.130.28, from New York City, had flagged it for a citation. Six hours later, the offending line was removed by 110.175.68.85. In a capricious world, it is soothing to see the gods of Wikipedia look fondly upon Fage.,**********,A Fage’s decay begins soon after you leave the store with it. You arrive at your room and it is perfectly ripe, ready to be devoured. If left untouched (even in the refrigerator), its constitution weakens rapidly over time. Once solid and well kempt, it becomes bloated, invaded by water and pockmarked with air bubbles. It is domesticated to mature quickly, its life cycle optimized for its predicted duration on a cooled U-store shelf.,Eating Fage is cognitively taxing. It requires patience and continued attentiveness. With each bite I must deftly maneuver my limber, fragile, white U-store spoon from small container to large container, carving out enough fruit and yogurt to best suit the dynamic needs of my palate.,The careful calibration involved in each spoonful of Fage belies the rate at which whole yogurts are consumed. Fages aren’t eaten, they are inhaled. A general appeal to its good taste is insufficient to explain this widely observed phenomenon. I think, rather, it is the intoxicating complementarity of its components, the vicious-delicious circle of tart and sweet enacted in the natural, harmonic motion of well to well to mouth, well to well to mouth.,I was surprised to hear that others mix the provided container of fruit with their yogurt. There are no canons to consult, as far as I know, but the admittedly circumspect oral tradition I do have tells me that this is a violation of Greek orthodoxy. Mixing upends the carefully designed balance of the yogurt and turns what should be an intentional and artful process of consumption into a fiendish and destructive one. May the practice be blotted out.,**********,A few weeks ago I left a note for the C-store manager about stocking Fage in addition to Chobani. I had grown fed up with the C-store—its poor selection of ice cream and seeming inability to respond adequately to demand as evidenced by the recurrent scarcity of sea salted “Dirty” potato chips—and I figured this was just a shot in the dark. A week or so later, however, I was alerted by a number of conscientious peers that there was Fage in the C-store. Following an involuntary exclamation and a mental fist pump, I proceeded to Frist to begin my consumption.,On most days, when I remember, I walk into the C-store and look at the available selection. I observe the ebb and flow of commerce, the push and pull of supply and demand. They do not yet stock my preferred flavors (2% strawberry and peach), and I am not hopeful that they will notice that the cherry yogurts linger long after the others are gone, or respond to that fact in case they do. The rigid, robust, black spoons that I once considered a distinctive advantage of the C-store now turn out to be too rigid and too robust to reach the last remnants of the Fage fruit cup. My follow-up note, with its enthusiastic gratitude and minor follow-up suggestions will almost certainly be ignored, even if it’s seen. But the Fage successfully scans at the register and is regularly replenished; it seems like it is here to stay. Each day, many individuals are satisfied in a way they would not have been without the local presence of this delicious and healthy product. Progress has been made. For that, I am thankful.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/fage-or-the-highway/,"

"I am walking home from the U-Store around 10pm on the first night I can remember not feeling cold after sunset. My Arrested Development poster of Tobias’ jean shorts keeps falling down and I need tape, but they only have the University-approved wall adhesive that mothers buy on your first day of college that you never use. I forget to buy allergy medicine. I stop for a moment on the sidewalk to fish a beaten up carton of 27’s out of my backpack. One cigarette appears to have been crushed by my textbooks. Good, I think. Cigarettes kill you.,I start walking again under pale orange streetlight, the wind is blowing, and it feels nice to be outside when everything is so quiet. The muted sounds of a singing group practicing, people crowded into small rooms playing loud music, boys shouting, girls laughing— the sound of the night settling into itself punctuates the silence.,I look up and blow smoke toward the Japanese magnolia blossoms. They are beautiful and I hope that the chemicals I exhale do not hurt them. I don’t know why I’m smoking. It is a fairly recent phenomenon; I used to be an exclusively “social smoker” and didn’t inhale, just like Woody Allen in Manhattan.,I think the smoking began after too many nights that started with drinking and ended with looks of panic or fear or confusion or profound worry on my best friends’ faces. And then drinking became less fun, the way something that hurts the people you love often does. That in itself is a good thing, but there is something perplexing about my suddenly lost good-time demeanor; after all, that is what won me friends in the first place.,Aside from my own awareness of the strangeness of walking home alone to do homework, backpack on, weekend in full swing, smoking, I feel other people noticing the changes in me. In the course of a weekend, I learned a lot about the sort of person I present myself as. Today a new friend wanted to introduce me to her friends, and finally she ushered me toward a familiar face. “This is Margaret!” Her friend and I were silent for a second, pausing in recognition, and just as I was about to tell her that we knew each other he said, “I have met her. Many times.” Totally blank, eyes clear and hard, and I noticed how nice they were. At first I thought his face was unreadable, that he was masking disapproval, but I realized that there was simply nothing to read. He felt nothing about me, wanted nothing more to do with me. It’s interesting the way first impressions rest on both people plus their respective current situations. I met this person once on the night I found out I had gotten hosed, and twice more when I happened to be crying. These three events and circumstances were the sum total of my contribution to our relationship. From every angle, to him, I am volatile and an arm’s-length distance is optimal, maybe more. I agree; if I were him, I would keep my distance too. Perhaps worst of all, this is not an entirely new experience for me. This guy was just the latest.,His friend, on the other hand, met me more recently, and she may have been drunk and feeling friendly, I don’t know. I gave her a cigarette and suddenly we were having a lovely conversation. This time it began with an infinitesimal kindness, as opposed to a crying girl in the arms of her friends who are loudly whispering, “It’s fine, it happens all the time, she’s really a good person, I’m sorry.” Their kindness is infinite, but I take baby steps—starting with cigarettes.,Now, still walking home, I want to sit down on the sidewalk and give up. I feel drained from half-illuminated self-awareness, I want someone to tell me that it is statistically impossible for everyone to hate me, for everyone to even have an opinion about me, that it just doesn’t matter. Or, I want to talk to my friends, but they probably need a day off from friend-therapy, so does Dr. Chin—it’s a weekend, too late to call. So here I am playing with a 7-Eleven lighter hoping there are strangers somewhere in the future who I won’t meet smoking or crying.,“Smoking will kill you,” I often mumble to people who bum cigarettes off me, but rarely has an acquaintance that started this way later stared back at me with eyes that say nothing but, “We’ve met.” I am responsible for that impression, and the others like it, so I cannot be hurt by the sterility of this exchange. But I hope that the change sticks, because never again do I want to leave such a bad impression on someone who could have been my friend.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/smoke-em-if-you-got-em/,"

"here are thirteen churches and one synagogue in the town where I grew up. It is an anomaly for Bergen County, which is known for, among other things, the heavily Jewish bastions of Fairlawn and Teaneck. My synagogue community is small when compared to communities in the more Jewish towns, though it is larger than others in the county’s northwestern corner. It is not especially tight-knit, but most people seem to know each other well enough to recognize one another on the high holidays and ask about their respective children.,This year when I came home for my family’s Passover Seder, my parents admitted that they might have underestimated the severity of the bullying and anti-Semitism that I and the other Jewish boys experienced in middle school. My parents had reconnected with family friends who have a son my age. He and I went to the same middle school. He was bullied even more severely than I was. After enrolling in the town’s public high school, he left for a school outside of the town because the anti-Semitism had become too much to bear. To my surprise, I found out that both he and I had independently insisted, while in middle school, that we needed to move out of the town as soon as possible.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/playground-prejudice/,"

"Getting tickets was a nightmare—the chances were slim to nothing. One in a quarter billion. But somehow, the odds worked in your favor. Seems pretty arbitrary, if you ask me. You were offered a front row seat under one condition—you would stay for all of it.,You are the only one in the theater—or at least you think you are. It’s dark in there—too dark, in your opinion. So dark that you can’t even find your playbill. Did they even give you a playbill?,The stage is dark too. You cannot not tell if the play has started, so you sit patiently. You grow impatient, and kick the seat in front of you (try not to do that). And then: the opening. A burst of bright light—a bit too bright, in your opinion—assails your senses. You feel exposed, and enter a hysteric rage. The following scenes whiz by, leaving you bewildered. Characters hum in and out. You are miserable, exhausted, unsatisfied. Some characters linger. Some disappear for good.,A woman with soft, sleepy eyes steps on stage. She narrates the indescribable flood of lights and sounds. Haphazardly generating alphabets, she stirs around phonetic lumps in the uncomfortable void which she calls “sai, lance.” (Silence.) These lumps are called “words,” and you finally understand.,She says your name. That is what she will call you, the audience. It invites emotional engagement, doesn’t it? Just wait for the second act.,The first act is confusing and makes you feel miserable for reasons you cannot describe. Characters laugh and scream and cry all at once. But by act two, your memories of the first act are vague and bizarre. You are even able to laugh about it. Pictures are taken, which become folded into your arbitrary chunks of memory. Had you not been diligently taking notes, you may not have remembered any of it at all (you are taking notes, right?).,Some characters feel unnecessary. They yell at you, or offer fake smiles. They pull you out of the moment, remind you that you are in a theater—awareness of the stage is a thespian’s nightmare. At some points, you think someone will jump from the stage and attack you. Or maybe hug you. But they never do. You notice a few misspoken lines, stumbles, missed cues, shattered props. You wonder if these are mistakes. Were they in the script? Is there a script? I advise you not to overanalyze the details, or you will miss important moments.,You sometimes become distracted, and completely lose track of why you came to the theater in the first place. You don’t even like theater. But the musical numbers bring your attention back to the performance. There are some tributes—some Beethoven in the first act. A long, loud compilation of Green Day in the second. Recurring free-form jazz in the third.,Three acts in, you realize that there is probably no intermission. Your back is becoming sore and you’re feeling heavy and hungry. You think back to the first two acts and feel like you missed some parts. Had you focused on the wrong dialogue? Dedicated your attention to the wrong voices? You regret all of the moments of boredom. The moments in which you heard, but did not listen. No one ever told you where to look. No one ever told you when to listen. How were you supposed to know? It all seems so obvious now.,The themes are expected but the plot feels thick, impossible to predict. You find yourself searching for a narrative—some cohesive storyline to scribble down in your notebook. But every time you think you’ve find the plot, you lose it. Perhaps you’ve stumbled upon an avant-garde play? How cultured of you!,You lose track of beginnings and endings. Everything starts to blur together—characters, songs, memories. You started to question the play. Is there a director? Are you the director?! You stand up, wave your hands in the air, and scream, “Stop! Stop the show! Go back to act two, the part with the nice boy who paid for your $8 coffee at that snooty coffee shop in the West Village!”,The actors freeze and stare at you. You sit back down.,The play keeps going. You do not know when it will end, and this scares you. You fear there may be no resolution to a play that doesn’t even seem to have a single continuous plotline. And the more you fear the end, the more distracted you become. You find yourself staring at the ceiling (beautiful, isn’t it? They painted it way back at the beginning of the universe). The play becomes tired, myopic. The characters are less interesting. You even find yourself staring at an empty stage for a few seconds, or maybe hours. You lost track of time. You grow anxious when alone in your thoughts. Your favorite characters are long gone.,You look around you—you are indeed the only one in the audience. In fact, had you not written anything down, who is to say the play ever happened? The awning outside would be stripped and recovered. The set would be destroyed in the workshop out back (hopefully recycled, though). The props, donated.,After the show you walk outside. It feels strange, to leave the set behind—the only tangible evidence the show ever existed. You feel you have missed so much. Does anyone have a script? Or a recording? A piece of the set, even? Where did all the actors go?,You only have your notebook, in which you managed to scribble in when the light from the stage was bright enough. You stand on the corner, and your cheeks feel full of life and your eyebrows furrow. You remember that old Shakespeare play—the one where he compared life to a stage, where every man must play a part. Or that Macbeth line about how we swagger and fret our hour upon the stage, all for nothing. Or was the word stagger? Strut, maybe? You wish strutting was that easy.,What a show. You’ve seen nothing else like it, you tell yourself. You would recommend it. But you would not see it again.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/all-the-worlds-a-stage/,"

She pauses for a moment when she catches her reflection in the brushed metal surface of the new refrigerator. Mary is young—like, really young to have a seventeen-year-old son, but her face is tired, creased with the worry lines of motherhood. She looks at the microwave clock. It is almost time to head out; today she takes her oldest to college. She quickly puts the food on the table, and goes to call up the stairs, and stubbing her toe on the corner of the counter she cries out, “Jesus!” Hopping slightly on one foot she calls out again, “Jesus H. Christ!”,A thin, long-haired boy softly bounces down the stairs. He is good-looking like his mother, so attractive that he could have any girl, but because he never dated, everyone from his high school had assumed he was gay. Mary often asked him if he felt comfortable talking to her about these things, explaining that she would love him no matter what he “liked,” but he always stopped her and began to pray. Just like his father, she would think.,Mary takes a seat at the table and pours three glasses of juice, and begins to put food on his plate.

"Even though by now I’m used to it, Princeton’s social scene is the weirdest. No one ever admits this: everyone talks it down and is like, “Oh, yeah, the eating clubs are just like frats!”—which I found incredibly unhelpful never having attended a school with fraternity houses, so, for all the comfort that comparison brought me, people might as well have been reassuring me that the Street was fine because the eating clubs are basically like Wiccan convents. I think, actually, that no one really knows what an eating club is, which is why the people who want me to write this are so insistent on it: even at Princeton, we’re fascinated by our own social scene and its nebulous, unquantifiable nature and what it means about us: What is the Street? What happens there? Is it fun or are we all just trapped in some kind of groupthink? And at the heart of it, of course: are we as douchey as they say we are?,This article is anonymous. This is lame, I know. But the thing is, I’m still figuring out where I fit in at Princeton, what parts of the social scene I’ll embrace or reject during my time here, and I realize this could change. Also, I really do want to speak honestly about my experience, so I’d rather not have my name associated with allusions to my debauchery or my tendency to make ungenerous characterizations of certain eating clubs and thereby offend people I like a lot (am really intimidated by). All the context you need to know is that I’m a freshman girl and that, for all the irony and sarcasm below, I love it here.,Pre-Princeton, when I was reading all these “Eating Clubs Exposed” articles, I noticed that every time the reporter asked someone at Cap what they looked for in a member, the answer was always, “just someone chill.” Which I found hilariously vague at the time but now I see how true it is: Cap is just laidback. I think it’s because there’s less of clearly delineated feeder system, so it always manages to attract a huge array of people who are connected by their shared chillness and not their shared frat or whatever.  Usually really good things happen to me at Cap, though I still don’t know how to play Ring of Fire and am really intimidated by the shade of red in the basement. ,I’ve only been to Cannon once or twice and usually found it to be just like Cottage with the oppressive athlete problem, except they’re younger athletes so I usually know at least some of them. I like all the games in the basement; those are fun and a good way to avoid the dance floor, which is admittedly pretty sick. It’s also super lushly decorated; I think it’s the most mansion-esque of all the clubs, though it looks a bit like a bunker. Also it is too huge and so always looks more empty than it is. ,Charter is a nerdy Cottage. It’s like, if I were an engineer and knew anyone in this eating club besides the people I came with, this would be an awesome, fun time. But when I go, (which, admittedly, has been thrice) it’s usually pretty empty, and I am significantly removed from the dominant demographic. So, I just stand awkwardly with my friends and talk about maybe introducing ourselves to someone out of boredom—which is the same situation I usually face in Cottage. Most often, we end up playing a drinking game with some random boys whose names I never get, and then losing, and then leaving. ,The vibes in Colonial are deeply wack. My first night out ever at Princeton was at Colonial; my first college beer was at Colonial; the first time a kindly upperclassman told me to rub my nose and stir my pinky in my beer to help it stop fizzing—which remains one of the most valuable pieces of advice I have ever received—was at Colonial. But, post-frosh week, I went twice to Colonial and both times was physically knocked to the ground, repeatedly, by some of the most intoxicated people I have ever encountered, so for my own health I’m trying to never, ever go back. ,Cottage and I have a very strained relationship. I hate the athlete-bro-bullshit culture where guys chill in packs and just stare at pretty girls as they walk by and make no moves—ever—towards them. There’s always groups of sorostitutes heading out to the dance floor, as the guys lounge by the windows and doors and watch them lewdly, which is a gross word but the right one for this situation. I hate having to flirt with randos with wristbands for beers, and hate it when they just stick a beer in my face with no attempt to engage in conversation, and hate it more when they misinterpret my big smile-hair flick-arm squeeze-”thank youuuuu!” combo as genuine interest in them as people and not just my way of obtaining alcohol to alleviate the pain of being in their weirdly awkward club. That said, I have had good nights at Cottage but only when I’m in full out slut mode, and by that I mean hard-core hitting on strangers and being embarrassingly forward and just generally making my momma proud.,I’ll always hold Cloister near and dear to my heart, as the majority of my formative frosh week moments took place there. The first times I went to Cloister, I didn’t know that Princeton parties don’t always happen outside & in the rain & that getting a beer isn’t usually a mosh pit scene. I actually made a lot of lasting friends as we pushed against each other in the mad press for beer. It’s also the place I literally climbed through windows to escape awkward boy situations, the place of my first street hook-up, the first time I ever fell down eating club stairs. Academic year Cloister is different, though—I rarely go, except in the case of special parties like Two Articles night, which was baller and much enjoyed. ,On most occasions uttering the phrase “I am going to/was at Ivy” gets you death glares, because: a) it sounds so pretentious, like you’re name dropping on purpose and b) because people are jealous. I have been both the receiver of death glares and the death glarer and hate both roles. But, inside, I always love Ivy because there’s a lot of people I love inside it. And there are also people who are super insecure about the fact that they’re in Ivy and hesitate to make conversation with you without knowing how they can use that conversation to climb up the social ladder. But a large portion of people in there are just awkward souls like me, only they dress well (read: expensively and/or in flannel) and hide their discomfort but remain tolerant of me and my general cynicism about the universe. Also, I usually just, like, hang and don’t really ever have to dance with anyone, which is always good news for me. ,… about that.,Terrace can be happy times and also very sad times. The thing with Terrace is that, if I go there, I’m at the end of a very long night and still trying to wring every ounce of a good time that I can out of it, which means that I’m starting to get desperate and questionable decisions will be made. A lot of my most uncomfortable situations have been compounded by horrible run-ins at Terrace. But, sometimes (often), Terrace will redeem my whole night of loathing everyone on this campus by hitting me hard with some super chill (high) people, who just like to sit on couches and hand me cookies. And, also, it can be just awesomely out there, like when people tackle each other on the pool table or there’s a dog hanging out on the couch. Also, I’m crushing on probably half of the Terrace population and secretly wish I could be as cool as they are. ,I LOVE TI SO MUCH I WILL HAVE ALL OF ITS CHILDREN ALWAYS. This may have something to do with the fact that usually I’m at TI at my most drunk, which is very drunk, and I’d probably have fun at precept at that level. But also I like that TI is actively un-douchey. In fact, I think TI is nice, but not the way Grandma’s nice—the way Owen Wilson is nice: nice to everyone but you still really want to be his best friend and just hang out for a while. I like how Domingo literally gives zero fucks and anyone who exerts a little effort can usually get inside, which means that inside there are legitimately millions of peopl. Also, even though I loathe dancing with every part of my sober body, the TI dance floor and drunk me get along super great, and boys even seem to agree, which is an A-plus occurrence to have happen. The only downside is how early it clears out some nights, when every one decides they’re going to go to Ivy and lounge against the wall and keep an artful smirk on their face.,I was in Tower once, to visit a friend who had just gotten picked up for Triangle and who was sending me texts like “WHXER R UUUU!!” and who, when I found him, was feasting on a Phat Lady and who let me eat like, half of it, which is probably my most transcendent drunk munchies moment to date. Other than that, I can’t really say I know much about Tower other than what my several theater-inclined friends tell me about it: they go a lot and really love it. But I can’t say, never having really spent more than ten minutes there.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/princetons-hottest-clubs-frosh/,"

"I am walking home from the U-Store around 10pm on the first night I can remember not feeling cold after sunset. My Arrested Development poster of Tobias’ jean shorts keeps falling down and I need tape, but they only have the University-approved wall adhesive that mothers buy on your first day of college that you never use. I forget to buy allergy medicine. I stop for a moment on the sidewalk to fish a beaten up carton of 27’s out of my backpack. One cigarette appears to have been crushed by my textbooks. Good, I think. Cigarettes kill you.,I start walking again under pale orange streetlight, the wind is blowing, and it feels nice to be outside when everything is so quiet. The muted sounds of a singing group practicing, people crowded into small rooms playing loud music, boys shouting, girls laughing— the sound of the night settling into itself punctuates the silence.,I look up and blow smoke toward the Japanese magnolia blossoms. They are beautiful and I hope that the chemicals I exhale do not hurt them. I don’t know why I’m smoking. It is a fairly recent phenomenon; I used to be an exclusively “social smoker” and didn’t inhale, just like Woody Allen in Manhattan.,I think the smoking began after too many nights that started with drinking and ended with looks of panic or fear or confusion or profound worry on my best friends’ faces. And then drinking became less fun, the way something that hurts the people you love often does. That in itself is a good thing, but there is something perplexing about my suddenly lost good-time demeanor; after all, that is what won me friends in the first place.,Aside from my own awareness of the strangeness of walking home alone to do homework, backpack on, weekend in full swing, smoking, I feel other people noticing the changes in me. In the course of a weekend, I learned a lot about the sort of person I present myself as. Today a new friend wanted to introduce me to her friends, and finally she ushered me toward a familiar face. “This is Margaret!” Her friend and I were silent for a second, pausing in recognition, and just as I was about to tell her that we knew each other he said, “I have met her. Many times.” Totally blank, eyes clear and hard, and I noticed how nice they were. At first I thought his face was unreadable, that he was masking disapproval, but I realized that there was simply nothing to read. He felt nothing about me, wanted nothing more to do with me. It’s interesting the way first impressions rest on both people plus their respective current situations. I met this person once on the night I found out I had gotten hosed, and twice more when I happened to be crying. These three events and circumstances were the sum total of my contribution to our relationship. From every angle, to him, I am volatile and an arm’s-length distance is optimal, maybe more. I agree; if I were him, I would keep my distance too. Perhaps worst of all, this is not an entirely new experience for me. This guy was just the latest.,His friend, on the other hand, met me more recently, and she may have been drunk and feeling friendly, I don’t know. I gave her a cigarette and suddenly we were having a lovely conversation. This time it began with an infinitesimal kindness, as opposed to a crying girl in the arms of her friends who are loudly whispering, “It’s fine, it happens all the time, she’s really a good person, I’m sorry.” Their kindness is infinite, but I take baby steps—starting with cigarettes.,Now, still walking home, I want to sit down on the sidewalk and give up. I feel drained from half-illuminated self-awareness, I want someone to tell me that it is statistically impossible for everyone to hate me, for everyone to even have an opinion about me, that it just doesn’t matter. Or, I want to talk to my friends, but they probably need a day off from friend-therapy, so does Dr. Chin—it’s a weekend, too late to call. So here I am playing with a 7-Eleven lighter hoping there are strangers somewhere in the future who I won’t meet smoking or crying.,“Smoking will kill you,” I often mumble to people who bum cigarettes off me, but rarely has an acquaintance that started this way later stared back at me with eyes that say nothing but, “We’ve met.” I am responsible for that impression, and the others like it, so I cannot be hurt by the sterility of this exchange. But I hope that the change sticks, because never again do I want to leave such a bad impression on someone who could have been my friend.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/smoke-em-if-you-got-em/?replytocom=123419,"

"We sit by the window, eating Chobani with rigid, robust, black C-store spoons.,“Did you know Chobani was actually founded by a Turkish dude?” I say. She is Greek, and I know some of the tumultuous regional history, but I am still surprised to see her eyes well with tears.,“Yeah. Pretty terrible,” I add a moment later. I look at the floor. “Let’s not finish these.”,The next day I notice my table covered in what appear to be shards of translucent glass. I look closer, and they glisten, as if alive. The ice-like pellets are scattered beside the half-filled containers. The Chobani left over on the aluminum tops had hardened, fallen, and broken up into unrecognizable fragments.,**********,I was introduced to Fage by a friend. I don’t think he realized at the time how special it is. I couldn’t say then just what it was either, but I was smitten, responding, I think, to the yogurt’s blinding, simple coherence; pert, perfectly split into symmetric, radial orange-like slices, complemented by a semi-cylindrical pouch worn by a caring mother nature comforting you with the delicately sweet fresh fruit of her womb.,**********,Fage was founded in 1922, in Greece. The American container announces that it is the #1 selling yogurt in Greece, near where it tells you that the name is “pronounced: Fa-yeh!” as if it must be exclaimed. Chobani was founded in 2005, in upstate New York. The “history” section of Chobani’s Wikipedia page says, “Chobani has been the beneficiary of the growth of Greek-type strained yogurt (known as ‘Turkish’ yogurt outside the United States).”,The comment about Turkish yogurt does not seem unrelated to the warning at the top of the Wikipedia page letting readers know that “a major contributor to the article appears to have a close relationship to the subject.” I find myself irritated, suspicious that the indignity of what amounts to highly remunerative cultural appropriation by a gauche, inferior product is being masked via exploitation of Wikipedia’s editorial permissiveness. I do some quick research: a Google search for “Greek yogurt” returns 2.2 million hits; “Turkish yogurt” returns 30.4k hits. I try in Spanish: “yogur Griego” returns 29K results, “yogur Turco” gets 7K. I try in Chinese:”希臘酸奶 ” gets 43K results, “土耳其酸奶” gets 12K. In Turkish, the results are similarly skewed.,I return to the site five days later. The sentence is gone. I check the page’s revision history to make sure I’m not crazy. Two days before, IP address 66.65.130.28, from New York City, had flagged it for a citation. Six hours later, the offending line was removed by 110.175.68.85. In a capricious world, it is soothing to see the gods of Wikipedia look fondly upon Fage.,**********,A Fage’s decay begins soon after you leave the store with it. You arrive at your room and it is perfectly ripe, ready to be devoured. If left untouched (even in the refrigerator), its constitution weakens rapidly over time. Once solid and well kempt, it becomes bloated, invaded by water and pockmarked with air bubbles. It is domesticated to mature quickly, its life cycle optimized for its predicted duration on a cooled U-store shelf.,Eating Fage is cognitively taxing. It requires patience and continued attentiveness. With each bite I must deftly maneuver my limber, fragile, white U-store spoon from small container to large container, carving out enough fruit and yogurt to best suit the dynamic needs of my palate.,The careful calibration involved in each spoonful of Fage belies the rate at which whole yogurts are consumed. Fages aren’t eaten, they are inhaled. A general appeal to its good taste is insufficient to explain this widely observed phenomenon. I think, rather, it is the intoxicating complementarity of its components, the vicious-delicious circle of tart and sweet enacted in the natural, harmonic motion of well to well to mouth, well to well to mouth.,I was surprised to hear that others mix the provided container of fruit with their yogurt. There are no canons to consult, as far as I know, but the admittedly circumspect oral tradition I do have tells me that this is a violation of Greek orthodoxy. Mixing upends the carefully designed balance of the yogurt and turns what should be an intentional and artful process of consumption into a fiendish and destructive one. May the practice be blotted out.,**********,A few weeks ago I left a note for the C-store manager about stocking Fage in addition to Chobani. I had grown fed up with the C-store—its poor selection of ice cream and seeming inability to respond adequately to demand as evidenced by the recurrent scarcity of sea salted “Dirty” potato chips—and I figured this was just a shot in the dark. A week or so later, however, I was alerted by a number of conscientious peers that there was Fage in the C-store. Following an involuntary exclamation and a mental fist pump, I proceeded to Frist to begin my consumption.,On most days, when I remember, I walk into the C-store and look at the available selection. I observe the ebb and flow of commerce, the push and pull of supply and demand. They do not yet stock my preferred flavors (2% strawberry and peach), and I am not hopeful that they will notice that the cherry yogurts linger long after the others are gone, or respond to that fact in case they do. The rigid, robust, black spoons that I once considered a distinctive advantage of the C-store now turn out to be too rigid and too robust to reach the last remnants of the Fage fruit cup. My follow-up note, with its enthusiastic gratitude and minor follow-up suggestions will almost certainly be ignored, even if it’s seen. But the Fage successfully scans at the register and is regularly replenished; it seems like it is here to stay. Each day, many individuals are satisfied in a way they would not have been without the local presence of this delicious and healthy product. Progress has been made. For that, I am thankful.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/fage-or-the-highway/?replytocom=119079,"

"here are thirteen churches and one synagogue in the town where I grew up. It is an anomaly for Bergen County, which is known for, among other things, the heavily Jewish bastions of Fairlawn and Teaneck. My synagogue community is small when compared to communities in the more Jewish towns, though it is larger than others in the county’s northwestern corner. It is not especially tight-knit, but most people seem to know each other well enough to recognize one another on the high holidays and ask about their respective children.,This year when I came home for my family’s Passover Seder, my parents admitted that they might have underestimated the severity of the bullying and anti-Semitism that I and the other Jewish boys experienced in middle school. My parents had reconnected with family friends who have a son my age. He and I went to the same middle school. He was bullied even more severely than I was. After enrolling in the town’s public high school, he left for a school outside of the town because the anti-Semitism had become too much to bear. To my surprise, I found out that both he and I had independently insisted, while in middle school, that we needed to move out of the town as soon as possible.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/playground-prejudice/?replytocom=124431,"

"The Ivy membership has gathered in the library. One by one, they choose who will fill the positions on the club’s officer board: they elect a male president, a male vice-president, a female bicker chair, and a male social chair. One more position remains: house manager. The competition is between a girl and a boy whose respective campus affiliations wield significant social power in the club. All of a sudden there’s a rumbling, some movement, a dull hum that grows in volume as more and more people chime in. “More girls! more girls! more girls!” The dark-wood-panelled room turns clamorous. “More girls!” The club, with its various affiliations, joins in unity for a brief moment. “More girls!” Order is restored. The members vote. The votes are counted. The male candidate wins.,This year, eating club officers are predominantly male. Not that this year is anything special: the fact that officers are usually guys is just one of those facts of life on the Street that its denizens don’t talk too much about, in the same way no one mentions that the considerable expenses these clubs demand—even with the increased financial aid from the university in upperclassman years—cause significant socioeconomic stratification, or that the racial makeup of the clubs is homogenous, or that affiliations play a huge role in what is billed as a “fair” bicker process. But I digress.,The Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership issued a report in 2011 investigating a perceived lack of female representation in leadership and high-ranking scholarship positions. The 100-page report encompasses much of the gender dynamics present in daily student life, but one of the most striking conclusions the Committee drew was that women occupied plenty of leadership roles on campus, just not the “high-profile ones.” “Despite being less likely than men to stand as candidates for a presidency or other more visible posts,” the report states, “undergraduate women do a large proportion of the important work in the organizations to which they belong.”,Eating clubs are, technically, off-campus, but those students elected to leadership positions have some of the most influential roles on campus, an influence not restricted only to social life. Elections of senior officers, which usually take place towards the end of fall semester or the beginning of spring semester, are characterized by all kinds of political posturing, affiliated muscle-flexing, all-too-frequent devolutions into popularity contests, and—underneath it all—fascinating, complex gender politics. Beyond just a failure in general terms of gender equality, the imbalance in numbers of men and women in officer positions has real consequences, among which are the frequency of sexist themes, the clubs’ subtle codification of what it means to be a “Cloister girl” or a “Terrace girl” or a “Cottage girl” that can feel restrictive and exclusionary, and their failures to adequately address instances of sexual assault.,It is important to remember throughout this article that the Street—and Princeton, for that matter—was an old boys’ club until relatively recently. Princeton only let in women in 1971, and since then, campus has come closer and closer to being a fair place, not just for women, but for anyone who’s not a white Protestant male. That said, Sally Frank had to go to the Supreme Court in 1991 to compel Ivy and Tiger Inn to allow women to join, and considering the social prestige of these clubs, I feel a little sick when I remember they’ve only let women in for barely longer than I’ve been alive. Though now one can look around Princeton and see all kinds of people who never would have been allowed to attend the Princeton of old, that Princeton is ever-present, its appeal happily trumpeted by the administration and much of the student body. In the beautiful old buildings, the ivy-covered walls, the sumptuously carpeted halls of eating clubs, one can almost feel the Princeton that once was. And from these clubs—just as from Princeton—alongside access to experiences and people who will change our lives and make us better, we inherit a legacy of privilege and elitism, a history of intolerance and inequality.,•••,I sought them through websites, through mutual friends, through Facebook, through repeated emails. I promised anonymity, off-the-record conversations, any kind of protection they wanted. I went to Small World, to back rooms in eating clubs I had never set foot in before, to darkened courtyards outside libraries. And I found them—not all of them, but some of them—the women who had been elected to eating club officerships for the coming year. They told vastly different stories and expressed vastly different frustrations and hopes: each club is a microcosm of its own gendered expectations, after all. My hope in this article is to highlight specific themes and patterns in how female officers deal with the inequalities that their position includes—and how the clubs deal with their female officers—in the hopes of bringing to light some of the underlying issues in these clubs. I don’t want to condemn specific eating clubs (they all have pretty tortured gender dynamics) nor editorialize the experience of anyone who agreed to talk to me. Part of the reason discussing gender dynamics is so important is that they’re so hard to talk about: they’re so subtle, so insidious, that sometimes we forget they’re even there.,All but one female officer wanted anonymity. This was partly because of grad board bullying (in many clubs, the president is the only one who is allowed to speak to the press), but partly due to worries about ruining the dynamic in what more often than not was a majority male officer corps: they didn’t want to be the girl who had run to a reporter to complain about the people she would be living with next year. Some, like Claire Liu from Cloister, just didn’t agree with the angle of my article. “I don’t feel that gender was a factor in my election or decision to run,” she wrote back to me. “Feel free to quote me on anything I’ve said.”,Claire’s comment prompted a lot of murmurs of approbation from the women I spoke to, but the numbers suggest that something is going on here. Princeton is about 49% female, but by compiling lists of the eating club officers I’ve calculated that—depending on who you count as an officer—only a third of eating club officers are women (33-35%). There is only one female president: Sarah Pak, of Colonial. All of the eating clubs (except Colonial if you count only what they call the “Top 5” officers: president, vice-president, social chair, house manager, and treasurer) have more male than female officers. In Colonial’s Top 5, they have more female than male officers: in fact, females are in their top three positions: president, vice-president, and social chair. But the entirety of their officer corps has more male than female officers, though the relative power of these positions diminishes as you move downwards.,This “Top 5” structure is how many of the eating clubs work. Most clubs have a “Top 5” whether nominal or not, and then a series of lower-ranking officers, in positions like “Liquid Assets Chair,” “IM Chair, and “Activities Chair” These top five (or six) are usually: president, vice president, social chair, house manager, treasurer, with maybe another one thrown in for good measure. These are the people who get to live in the club, who get ICC stickers, who represent the club to both alumni and membership. They make a kind of mind-boggling commitment, out of love for the club and hope for it to be better, assume legal responsibility, agree to giving up several of their nights a week so they can be present at social events, deal with members, grad board, alumni. Everyone says it’s fun. I’ll take their word for it.,•••,Over the course of about a month, I spoke to seven female officers (though I contacted—and was ignored by—many more). In this article, they all, except for one, have pseudonyms, and much of what they told me was off-the-record. Many of what will seem to be wild assertions are based in facts from conversations with the officers, though I cannot name specific events. Goldie, Fern, Ruby and Melody are officers of selective clubs; Robin and Hazel are officers of sign-ins, as is Miriam Pearsall, but that’s actually her name and she’s letting me quote her and say her exact position, and her club, which is Colonial.,Most officers I talked to shared a goal of wanting to make their respective clubs better places overall, but a few specifically highlighted the desire to make it a safer place for women. Several women recount tales of dealing with issues of sexual assault in their club, especially when it comes to legitimizing the experience of the victim and making sure appropriate measures are taken to prevent such instances from happening in the future. The position of TI “safety czar” was implemented in 2008 after a TI alum sued the club because she was sexually assaulted during pickups. Safety czar is usually a girl, and part of her responsibility is to make sure no one gets too drunk or assaulted on the dance floor; that no one passes out; that no one needs to go the hospital. TI isn’t alone in taking measures like this. Most clubs make sure they have one male and one female on duty at all times to go into bathrooms and make sure everything’s okay in there, that no one’s slumped by the toilet, forgotten by equally drunk friends, needing help. “That’s something that boys are really good about, too,” Ruby—an officer of a selective club—tells me. “It’s not just girls.” Hazel, an officer of a sign-in club, nonetheless stresses that this is one of the most important ways a girl can be involved in her eating club, and one of the most important reasons to make sure more females are elected to officer positions: for the safety of everyone in the club, whether they’re members or guests.,Another way female officers seek to mitigate the gendered tensions of their social scenes is through themes. Ruby says she tries really, really hard to ignore “…and Sluts/Hos” themes when organizing an event. (Examples of past themes of this ilk—from multiple clubs—include: Rubik’s Cubes and Sluts, Jedis and Sluts, ConquistaBros and NavaHos, and one eating club even received the suggestion of “Dinosaurs and Sluts”). “It’s really hard,” Melody says, “because some girls find it offensive, but then other girls want to dress provocatively.” This is one of the issues facing modern feminism today: is the sexualization and objectification of the female body a means of domination or liberation? How do we decide?,•••,Of course, any election is political, and gender dynamics aren’t always the most direct cause of the gender imbalance in eating club officers. One of the most common reasons I hear for girls not being elected is that guys are “just better” at organizing voting blocs, especially through frats. This is an issue that comes up over and over again, especially in selective clubs that are made up largely of affiliations, be they fraternities, sororities, sports teams, or other extracurricular groups. The nature of frats and sororities especially is such that frats create what are assumed to be tight groups of guy friends, who all “have each others’ backs” and whose friendships seem legitimate, strong, according to Goldie, an officer of a selective club with a significant Greek population. Sororities, however—massive amalgamations of over a hundred girls—are not perceived as such, partly because of their size and partly because “sorority girl” often codes for “shallow social climber.” In one selective club, a sophomore tells me, there was a close race between an affiliated girl and an affiliated guy this year. Girls of another sorority, the rumor goes, pooled their votes to vote for the guy, seemingly reasoning it would be better to have a male officer than a girl of a rival affiliation, though many of these same girls had articulated very clearly earlier that the club needed more girl officers. What they meant, it seems, is that they wanted more girls from their affiliation. Better a boy than their competition.,Guys, it seems, can get away with this partisanship more than girls can. “When girls stick together it’s perceived as more about social status than anything else,” Goldie explains to me, “whereas with guys it’s like, ‘oh, they’re brothers.’” In elections, she says, “girls are perceived as wanting a position for the wrong reasons, people think they want it to go one step further in social power,” whereas with guys there’s none of this. “They just think he’s probably a really good guy and that he cares about the club.” This applies to campaigning, too: no clubs have articulated rules about campaigning, but there are many subtle ways one can make it clear that one is interested in a officer position. With girls, these signs—being friendlier than usual, hanging around the club more—are often mocked in Goldie’s club, where with guys it’s not even mentioned.,In one selective club—in which Ruby tells me that “[affiliated] guys definitely want to see one of their own as president,”—this kind of behavior would be met with suspicion. “If a guy was suddenly, like, being super friendly, you would know it was because they were running. With girls, it was just what we would do anyway.” While this is nice for those girls who are super friendly, it implies that only popular girls run in the first place. With guys, the playing field seems to be more level: you don’t have to be gregarious and amiable to get elected. Instead, you just have to be flanked by an army of friends, and you only have to be nice to people for a couple weeks, until you’re elected. Then, it all can go back to normal, guys being taciturn and girls doing everything they can to be universally liked.,Fern, whose selective club is also marked by a significant amount of affiliated members, recounts a remark she heard an older member make in the couple months leading up to elections. A group of members were discussing who would run and who would win, and someone expressed a hope there might be a girl president. This older girl, Fern says, laughed and said “Why would I waste my vote on a girl when she would never get elected anyway?” Fern lowers her voice and holds my gaze. “Listen,” she says, punctuating each word by pressing her hand against the table. “Boys are not the reason that girls aren’t getting elected. Girls are the reason girls aren’t getting elected.”,•••,The work girls put into being perceived as friendly and approachable may be exactly why they aren’t elected to the head positions. Over and over again, girls tell me that there is an expectation that the president will be a boy. I hear it from female officers of sign-in clubs and selective clubs, athletes, sorority girls, and unaffiliated girls. Especially in the cases of girls who ran for a more powerful role than what they,eventually were appointed or elected to (and this is the story of almost every female officer—and symptomatic of the way elections work anyway—you start from the top and work your way down) one of the big reasons these women think they didn’t win president, or vice-president, or any of the subsequent positions, is that they just didn’t “seem” like presidential material. They don’t say that necessarily codes for “man,” but the suggestion is obvious. The girls are confident, and maintain they would have been just as good in a more powerful position as they are going to be in the one they were elected to, (they all stress they are happy in their current ones, and seem it) but they know that they were, just by virtue of being female, fighting a losing battle. Colonial was the only eating club with a female president last year, and some of the other clubs have had at least one female president in recent memory (except Cannon). When this class ran, though, there were no female presidential shoes to fill. The glass ceiling, which had been cracked in years past, was newly smooth, imperfection-free.,That said, according to Fern, “nobody thinks it’s okay to have no female officers.” In another eating club, I hear, a position that was usually held by a girl was held by a guy last year. During elections, at least half the club heard him say it would be better for a girl to have it. Realizing he’d made a faux-pas, he backtracked, saying he just meant that girls were kinder, better with people (a girl would eventually be elected to it). This idea of girls’ kindness suiting them for some positions is the classic double-standard: it’s exactly this that (male) opponents use to imply they wouldn’t be good in more powerful positions. The well-liked women who run for these positions are sometimes called out for being too friendly, too kind, and sometimes people wonder loudly whether—given their girl’s history of being amiable, likable—they’d be able to assert themselves where it matters. As sexist views usually are, this proves inconsistent. Female officers report over and over again feeling that they do more work than their male counterparts and take their position “more seriously,” and that they receive more backlash when they assert themselves than guys do.,Fern, when asked why she thinks fewer girls run in the first place, mentioned that she thinks girls take commitments more seriously. Being an eating club officer involves legal responsibility and social and extracurricular sacrifices that it takes a certain kind of person to make. “I had to carefully consider the impact being an officer would have on my academics, and I’m involved in a lot of activities. The list of people willing to make that kind of commitment is very small,” Fern says.,Another officer of a selective club agrees. “There’s just an impression that guys can handle it, more,” Lucretia says. Goldie tells the story of the time when an election came down to a very close call between a boy and a girl, and many members of the club worried aloud that the girl might be overcommitted, though no one had even mentioned this concern when a popular, busy frat boy was elected to another position.,•••,Another matter is how these female officers create an identity within their respective positions. The girls I talk to uniformly express irritation with the reflection of their power they see in the eyes of the people who voted for (or against) them. Goldie is irritated that people keep calling her “HBIC,” a popular acronym for “Head Bitch in Charge,” usually meant to gently mock women who decide they’re calling the shots, and then do so. “It kind of made me livid that because I’m a woman in power I’m a bitch, just because I have ideas and opinions and an authoritative position and don’t take bullshit. ‘Bitch’ is used pretty colloquially these days, but it still makes me crazy,” she says. She mostly hears it from girls, and says she cannot help but hear derision in it.,This is echoed by Ruby, who just has embraced the fact that her outspoken, no-nonsense nature means that people are going to comment on it. “I’m a sassy bitch,” she remarks in a joking way, but she admits she’s being truthful. She’s aware that’s how she’s perceived, so she tries to soften her tone in the emails she sends to her eating club, and how she takes care of her tasks.,But if you’re not a bitch, you’re also a kind of maternal figure. “I’ve been called a mom before,” Melody says. Robin, an officer of a sign-in club, embraces the identifier, saying “I behave like a mom, making sure people are nice by just being nice, plus I know where everyone’s shit is.” Girls are supposed to be more responsible, cleaner, more considerate. And none of these are bad things: Hazel—who mentioned that, during elections, she got the idea that she was understood to be “nurturing,”—wishes that those characteristics didn’t necessarily code for second, third, or fourth in command. “There’s no reason you can’t be nurturing and not also be a good leader,” she says. But that’s what people seem to think.,Melody, who proudly calls herself a feminist (the only girl I speak to who offers this self-identifier of her own accord, though I did not ask the others), also voices frustration with this bitch/mom complex. She’s well-known in her club for her outspoken views on feminism, but—she says—“I’m really girly, and sometimes that means people don’t take me seriously.” Another irritation is the mocking she’ll get for doing certain things—say, wearing make-up or liking pink. “That’s not feminist!” people say to her. Melody rolls her eyes when she recounts these interactions. “It’s not about doing stuff that guys would do,” she says. “It’s about girly things being okay to do.”,Melody mentions emails as a particular medium through which she tries to gain respect, and the issue of emails is a loaded one for female officers. The primary way they communicate with their clubs, they have to strike just the right balance: warrant respect, but still seem approachable, but not in a way that makes them seem like a pushover. Almost every female officer tells me that in emails guys get away with a kind of humor that’s unreachable for girls, a mix of bullying and sex jokes, underpinned by a constant kind of fratty ethos about raging face that it’s harder for girls to pull off. For those who don’t send out social emails, the challenge is “not looking like an aggressive bitch,” Ruby says. “I’m always trying to add exclamation points.” Melody, however, says that her tendency to use exclamation points means that she loses respect.,•••,In comparison to the failures of other eating clubs to fairly and equally represent their female members, Colonial Club seems like a dream come true. Where some female officers were dismissed in elections as too “nurturing,” relegated to vice-president because that was a “subordinate” position, Colonial has filled their highest-ranking positions with three women. Colonial has a history of progressivism: they were the first club on the Street to allow women membership and the first non-bicker club. This is something they’re really proud of, Miriam Pearsall, the social chair, says, and the tradition of equality continues today with the club’s reputation as “the Asian one,” something of which everyone in the club is very conscious. Not everyone in the club is Asian, of course, but the perception of the club as such is essential to its identity, whether in the embrace or rejection of it.,Though what it’s like to be Asian on this campus does not fall within the scope of this article—and certainly not the personal experience of its author—I have been shocked to see and to hear from Asian and Asian-American friends the prejudices they confront on a daily basis. These dynamics have received more and more attention in recent years, from major news outlets like the New York Times and student-led initiatives at colleges like Duke, meant to push back against these problems, but still, there is a lot of work left to be done. It fits right into Colonial’s ethos of progressivity and acceptance that a group of people who have had to confront a never-ending stream of campus prejudice find themselves here, where people just like this have found themselves for decades, now.,“Colonial’s Asian stereotype is for some reason seen as negative,” Miriam says. Members are well aware, and race was something that came up frequently—though obliquely—during elections. “I remember someone asked me a specific question about how I would convince someone that they should come here and I remember saying, well, it’s not about race. People here are very diverse in their own ways, part of different parts of campus, different talents … and in the end personality transcends race.” Miriam is black, something she acknowledges is surprising for a club stereotyped to be full of Asians. She is one of few black officers overall (the racial makeup of eating club officers, too, is a topic for a whole other article.) “It’s really interesting to me how our officer corps doesn’t really represent the demographic of the club,” Miriam says.,Miriam ran against a boy in a frat and people who had been officers for parts of their sophomore year, which she had not. In the elections, she was the underdog. Her election is a testament both to her charisma and passion and the fairness of Colonial’s elections. She is proud to be one of the few black officers in Colonial’s history and on the Street but knows this is a problem. “The people I’ve talked to in the black community are pretty vocal in how they don’t feel welcome in a bunch of eating clubs, and it seems wrong to me that certain areas are off-limits for people still, even if it’s implied,” she says. “There’s this invisible barrier [that] is really unfortunate, and perpetuates a lot of misunderstandings and exclusion.”,This is not something that other clubs are often forced to confront, given the their overwhelming homogeneity. It seems that constantly confronting the prejudices of others has led Colonial’s members to create a more inclusive climate. “There were people who applied for certain positions and in other clubs they wouldn’t even consider them,” Miriam claims, “but we consider the holistic view. At other clubs it’s more about your image of being a partier.”,It’s easy for one eating club to criticize another, but I think Miriam might be on to something. In other clubs (and in Colonial, too, I’m sure) there’s a real concern with how the officers will make the clubs look. It’s just that, in Colonial’s case, it wants to look accepting, open, and progressive, so it’s easier for females (and un-affiliated, non-white females, no less!) to be elected. But in other clubs, the history they’re so proud of is a history of all-male uber-selectivity, wealth, and social prestige. And that’s the reason, I think, that many of the female officers I talked to are the kinds of girls who are confident enough to demand what is still not a traditional role for women, and qualified enough to earn it, and also pretty attractive. They’re the kinds of girls straight guys probably want to have sex with, but if that’s not going to happen they’re fine with just hanging out with them. Many of the girls I spoke to were “chill,” that definitionless, omnipresent word that reveals more about the person saying it than the person called it. A “chill” person is just a person who doesn’t stress you out. And girls—it is clear—stress people out.,When “chill” is used to describe a girl it means she’s not high-strung, not self-promoting. She probably smokes weed or can chug a beer. In Terrace, where I am a member, it’s a word that I am told used to be used in a desperate, searching sense: “Where are the girl chillers?” dudes would bellow down the hallways, waving around pitchers of beer. “WHERE ARE THE GIRL CHILLERS?” Since then, they have appeared: girls who smoke, girls who hang, girls who drink beer, girls who aren’t worried so much about their hair or their dresses or their romantic lives that they kill dudes’ vibes, girls who—effectively—have capitulated without complaint to male forms of socializing. In a way, being “chill” is a status symbol, a mark of social privilege: guys can “chill” because things are easier for them, because girls—in every part of campus—are still trying to prove themselves equal to a standard guys have set, because to be a well-liked girl used to mean being a girl immaculately dressed and well-mannered, a light and fascinating conversationalist, filled with all kinds of amusing and diverting skills, and that meant girls were often stressed out. In their attempts to be the kind of girls guys would want to be around, they became the exact opposite. Now, guys say, it’s time to chill out.,•••,I ask many of the officers I talk to articulate what the stereotype of the typical girl in their eating club is—and with the exception of one of the most elitist clubs on the Street (guess which)—the answer is usually “girls who don’t take themselves too seriously,” or “girls who can take a joke,” or “girls who are comfortable with themselves.” When I asked the same question about guys, I usually received something along the lines of “smart, funny,” and then the respective affiliation that characterized the eating club, whether it was “athlete” or “frat bro” or “theater person.” This difference could be attributed to the fact that I only spoke to female officers—guys surely feel pressure to present a kind of maleness that girls are less able to articulate—but the definition of what makes an “X Eating Club Girl” rests on the apparent achievement of the girls to be a different kind of girl than “the average one,” who—I suppose—must be defined by opposites: unchill, unable to take a joke, uncomfortable with themselves.,Every female officer I spoke to was friendly, open, intelligent, articulate—and a little jumpy, a little nervous. Much of it was just anxiety about being interviewed, but much of it was because they were saying, out loud, what you’re not really allowed to say as a woman, these days, especially if you’ve been elected to a representative position by a group of your peers: that you really, really are worried about being liked.,I ask all of them whether they’re worried about moving into a house full of dudes for the next year, and they all gently roll their eyes at me. I ask them whether they’re worried about living in what is essentially a frat house, where wasted and inconsiderate people come to be belligerent, and they smile and say that doesn’t scare them either. They’re not afraid of alums or grad boards. No: Melody tells me that “the most terrifying part is not doing a good job and having people not like you,” but Ruby tells me that it’s “doing your job and having people not like you because of it.” Both of those sound about right.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the-girls-in-charge-of-the-old-boys-clubs/,"

"My dad always joked that he encouraged me to play sports because I was supposed to be born a boy (I am the youngest of three girls—his final, failed attempt at contributing a Y chromosome to the world). After trying out a wide variety of athletic pursuits in the sixth grade (fencing, softball, and circus camp), I found basketball to be the most fulfilling. I ended up taking basketball pretty seriously and played all the way through high school and became a captain of the varsity team.,But then there’s the tragedy of being a 5’5’ female on a not-super-athletic campus—since I wasn’t willing to commit myself to the club basketball practice schedule, there weren’t many opportunities for me to play casual basketball. Whenever I would enter Dillon Gym on my way to the workout room, I’d pass the ongoing pick-up basketball games, which consisted of many tall, aggressive-looking men. I always wondered how they organized these games—did they just form organically, or is there some association of casual basketball players that I don’t know about? Either way, I never had the nerve to approach them and ask to join.,Last week, my hall-mate Max stuck his head into my room and asked if I was interested in walking over to Dillon Gym with him. I wasn’t doing anything interesting, so I changed, grabbed a book of poetry to read on a stationary-bike, and headed over. As we entered the gym, I heard the familiar heavy thumps, grunts and screeches coming from the various pick-up games. Just as I was about to retreat to the workout room, one of the players screamed over to Max:,“Yo, you wanna play?”,“Yeah I’ll go in for the next game,” Max responded casually. He then turned to me. “Lil, you want in?”,I instinctively said “oh, no. That wouldn’t end well.” I knew that he was just asking me out of courtesy.,“You sure?” he asked absently, as if he had already accepted my response.,In that moment, something came over me. My frolicsome sixth-grade self erupted through my apathetic college-sophomore exterior. “Actually, yeah. Yeah! I’ll play. If you don’t think they’d mind.” And that’s how I found myself playing in an all-male pick-up game.,At the start of the next game, everyone started matching up with the person they would guard. When I played with girls, I usually matched up with one of the shooting guards (or anyone who wasn’t really tall). However, my former strategy was useless in this context since everyone was four standard deviations taller than me.,So I stood there awkwardly and waited for a guy from the other team to drift over to me. A grad student whose name I did not catch (but I’ll refer to him as Phil for no particular reason) was the only one of the opposing team who wasn’t yet matched up with someone. After exchanging smirks with his fellow teammates, Phil leisurely approached me, swinging his arms heavily at his sides. I have never seen a sarcastic expression of “LOL” executed so brilliantly with body language alone.,As soon as he was within earshot of me, he said the following: “I’ll guard the female. I’m good with the ladies.”,My immediate reaction to this was amusement. I gave a honk-like sarcastic laugh. I had expected that there’d be sexism, and I was kind of glad it was palpable instead of under the surface. In the few moments I had between this statement and the start of the game, I decided that I needed to come up with some sort of comical response.,I responded, “Oh good! Same here.”,I wasn’t really sure what I meant by that— it’s really a cop out in terms of come backs because you could pretty much follow any jab with that line. I guess it implied that I was “good with the ladies” as well.,The game was exhausting. I knew that my only valuable asset was my speed, so I sprinted everywhere, even when I didn’t need to. Even worse, whenever one of the guys would accidentally fling his moist, hairy limbs into my face, he would stop and sincerely apologize. In these moments I felt that I had to offer a little girlish giggle or smirk to assure them that I wasn’t hurt.,My least favorite part was ‘boxing-out.’ If you’ve played basketball before, you know how awkward inter-sex boxing out is. It’s essentially the process of aggressively wedging yourself between your opponent and the basket, so you’ll be able to rebound the ball. If you’re having trouble envisioning this, perhaps the best analogy I can offer is the basement of T.I. on a Saturday night. Whenever a shot was thrown up, I shamelessly maneuvered my butt into Phil’s groins. Despite this act of heroism, I did not get many rebounds.,Throughout the game, Phil proceeded to roll his eyes at me when I guarded him. He was obscenely lazy and hardly moved around but, unfortunately for me, he was a really good shooter.,Eventually, one of my teammates gave me some tips— “don’t be afraid to shove the fuck out of Phil” and “you’re not going to get the ball unless you look like you want the ball.” I was unsure of whether to take these as more unsolicited sexist innuendo or actual advice, but I decided to listen to him. I both “shoved the fuck” out of Phil and clapped when I wanted the ball. They ended up passing to me twice. In both cases, I was wide open, and in both cases, I made the shot. Everyone on my team high fived me shortly after I scored. Although I know they meant well, it came across as patronizing.,I wasn’t sure how I felt about the whole experience. I left the gym drenched in sweat, and lay on my bed, paralyzed with exhaustion for a few hours (note that this is distinct from ‘sleep’). I’m not sure if I was angry with Phil for being an overtly sexist jerk, or if that anger just make me a hypocrite. Maybe his behavior—defending his masculinity by acting like a dude—isn’t so far off from what I was doing; I giggled if someone apologized to me, I felt awkward about being aggressive, and initially I didn’t think I deserved to have the ball passed to me. My insecurity was purely because of my gender; I was acting like a stereotypical girl, which maybe gives Phil every right to treat me like one. Despite this, I’m glad that I played. My height-to-scoring ratio was definitely impressive, confirming my hypothesis that you don’t need testicles to play basketball.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/this-week-in-sports-baskets-and-balls/,"

"Getting tickets was a nightmare—the chances were slim to nothing. One in a quarter billion. But somehow, the odds worked in your favor. Seems pretty arbitrary, if you ask me. You were offered a front row seat under one condition—you would stay for all of it.,You are the only one in the theater—or at least you think you are. It’s dark in there—too dark, in your opinion. So dark that you can’t even find your playbill. Did they even give you a playbill?,The stage is dark too. You cannot not tell if the play has started, so you sit patiently. You grow impatient, and kick the seat in front of you (try not to do that). And then: the opening. A burst of bright light—a bit too bright, in your opinion—assails your senses. You feel exposed, and enter a hysteric rage. The following scenes whiz by, leaving you bewildered. Characters hum in and out. You are miserable, exhausted, unsatisfied. Some characters linger. Some disappear for good.,A woman with soft, sleepy eyes steps on stage. She narrates the indescribable flood of lights and sounds. Haphazardly generating alphabets, she stirs around phonetic lumps in the uncomfortable void which she calls “sai, lance.” (Silence.) These lumps are called “words,” and you finally understand.,She says your name. That is what she will call you, the audience. It invites emotional engagement, doesn’t it? Just wait for the second act.,The first act is confusing and makes you feel miserable for reasons you cannot describe. Characters laugh and scream and cry all at once. But by act two, your memories of the first act are vague and bizarre. You are even able to laugh about it. Pictures are taken, which become folded into your arbitrary chunks of memory. Had you not been diligently taking notes, you may not have remembered any of it at all (you are taking notes, right?).,Some characters feel unnecessary. They yell at you, or offer fake smiles. They pull you out of the moment, remind you that you are in a theater—awareness of the stage is a thespian’s nightmare. At some points, you think someone will jump from the stage and attack you. Or maybe hug you. But they never do. You notice a few misspoken lines, stumbles, missed cues, shattered props. You wonder if these are mistakes. Were they in the script? Is there a script? I advise you not to overanalyze the details, or you will miss important moments.,You sometimes become distracted, and completely lose track of why you came to the theater in the first place. You don’t even like theater. But the musical numbers bring your attention back to the performance. There are some tributes—some Beethoven in the first act. A long, loud compilation of Green Day in the second. Recurring free-form jazz in the third.,Three acts in, you realize that there is probably no intermission. Your back is becoming sore and you’re feeling heavy and hungry. You think back to the first two acts and feel like you missed some parts. Had you focused on the wrong dialogue? Dedicated your attention to the wrong voices? You regret all of the moments of boredom. The moments in which you heard, but did not listen. No one ever told you where to look. No one ever told you when to listen. How were you supposed to know? It all seems so obvious now.,The themes are expected but the plot feels thick, impossible to predict. You find yourself searching for a narrative—some cohesive storyline to scribble down in your notebook. But every time you think you’ve find the plot, you lose it. Perhaps you’ve stumbled upon an avant-garde play? How cultured of you!,You lose track of beginnings and endings. Everything starts to blur together—characters, songs, memories. You started to question the play. Is there a director? Are you the director?! You stand up, wave your hands in the air, and scream, “Stop! Stop the show! Go back to act two, the part with the nice boy who paid for your $8 coffee at that snooty coffee shop in the West Village!”,The actors freeze and stare at you. You sit back down.,The play keeps going. You do not know when it will end, and this scares you. You fear there may be no resolution to a play that doesn’t even seem to have a single continuous plotline. And the more you fear the end, the more distracted you become. You find yourself staring at the ceiling (beautiful, isn’t it? They painted it way back at the beginning of the universe). The play becomes tired, myopic. The characters are less interesting. You even find yourself staring at an empty stage for a few seconds, or maybe hours. You lost track of time. You grow anxious when alone in your thoughts. Your favorite characters are long gone.,You look around you—you are indeed the only one in the audience. In fact, had you not written anything down, who is to say the play ever happened? The awning outside would be stripped and recovered. The set would be destroyed in the workshop out back (hopefully recycled, though). The props, donated.,After the show you walk outside. It feels strange, to leave the set behind—the only tangible evidence the show ever existed. You feel you have missed so much. Does anyone have a script? Or a recording? A piece of the set, even? Where did all the actors go?,You only have your notebook, in which you managed to scribble in when the light from the stage was bright enough. You stand on the corner, and your cheeks feel full of life and your eyebrows furrow. You remember that old Shakespeare play—the one where he compared life to a stage, where every man must play a part. Or that Macbeth line about how we swagger and fret our hour upon the stage, all for nothing. Or was the word stagger? Strut, maybe? You wish strutting was that easy.,What a show.

"On July 19th, 2011, Kidz Bop, the by kidz, for kids, musical juggernaut, released its 20th installment. On October 17th, 2011, I sat in my dorm room and listened to it in its entirety. My intention was to write a serious music review about the album. I had always thought Kidz Bop was stupid based solely on the commercials, but I figured it deserved to be given a chance. It didn’t. By the end I felt physically sick. After grabbing a barf bag and some tissues to clean the blood out of my ears, I proceeded to browse through previews of the other 19 albums on iTunes. It didn’t get any better. I even tried watching some Kidz Bop music videos on YouTube, but those were downright depressing. Before Kidz Bop, I had no idea just how terrible music can be in the wrong hands. ,For those of you who have never heard of Kidz Bop, it is kind of like the Now That’s What I Call Music! franchise (which will soon be releasing its 40th installment!), except much, much worse. For those of you who have never heard of “Now!” it is a brand of pop music compilation albums. Essentially, it takes every song that is aggressively overplayed on the radio and puts them all in one place so you can aggressively overplay them together, in the comfort of your own home. How can it get worse than Now! you ask? While Now! is not something I would personally pay for when I can make my own mixes, I suppose I can comprehend why some people might. With Kidz Bop, however, I can find no logical reason why anyone would ever buy one of their CDs, unless we legalize torture.  ,Like Now!, Kidz Bop compiles the biggest hits on the radio into one CD, but unlike Now!, it remakes the background music with significantly worse production value and has a bunch of tone deaf kidz sing the whole thing while yelling out “wooooo!” and “oh yeah!” in unison for no reason at random points throughout the songs. They switch the gender of the singers constantly and seem to decide arbitrarily how many of the kidz should sing at a time. It’s like they’ve assembled an army of Rebecca Blacks who they brainwash and bi-annually send out to destroy every popular song of the past few months.,To fully understand what I am talking about, look no further than the first ever Kidz Bop CD’s rendition of Blink-182’s “All the Small Things”. I liked this song, until I heard the Kidz Bop Kids’ interpretation. The lead singer sounds like a drunken middle-aged man with lung cancer and the background singers sound like a gaggle of oompa-loompas strung out on cocaine. Who could have possibly been sadistic enough to put something so repulsive on the open market? And why haven’t they been tarred and feathered yet? ,The terrible singing isn’t even the worst part; that honor goes to the lyrics. A lot of the popular songs on the radio today have lyrics that could be considered inappropriate for young children. Kidz Bop deals with this racy subject matter by subtly changing the original lines to more “kid-friendly” versions. Here are a few of the best lyric changes I found during my research, accompanied by some personal commentary:,Break Even by The Script,_Original_- “I’m still alive but I’m barely breathin’ / Just prayed to a God that I don’t believe in”,_Kidz Bop_- “I’m still alive but I’m barely breathin’ / Just prayin’ to a thing that I don’t believe in” ,(Did they do this because they don’t want to encourage not believing in God or did they not want to mention God at all to avoid alienating all of the atheist kids listening? Are the kidz praying to false idols instead?),Single Ladies by Beyonce,Original- “I’m up on him, he up on me / Don’t pay him any attention … Don’t be mad once you see that he want it”,KB- “I’m into him, he’s into me / Don’t pay him any attention … Don’t be mad once you see that he’s into it”,(Is being “into it” that much more appropriate than “wanting it”?),Hey Soul Sister by Train,Original- “Like a Virgin, you’re Madonna / And I’m always gonna wanna blow your mind”,KB- “Like a popstar, you’re Madonna / And I’m always gonna wanna blow your mind” ,Alejandro by Lady Gaga,Original- “She’s not broken, she’s just a baby / But her boyfriend’s like a dad, just like a dad”,KB- “She’s not broken, she’s just a baby / But her boyfriend’s like a friend, just like a friend” ,Nothin’ On You by B.o.B and Bruno Mars,Original- “And you wild when you ain’t got nothin’ on”,KB- “And you out when you ain’t got anyone” ,(This changes from a fun, wild time to a depressing and lonely night out. Why, Kidz Bop? This isn’t better.),Tik Tok by Ke$ha,Original- “Before I leave/Brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack,” ,KB- “Before I leave/Brush my teeth and then I go pack”,Original- “Tonight Ima fight til we see the sun light”,KB- “Tonight I’m alright, til we see the sun light”,(Fight? Seriously? And what’s so bad about the sun light that makes things suddenly not alright? Are these kids vampires?),California Girls by Katy Perry ft. Snoop Dogg,Original- A verse by Snoop Dogg,KB- No rap whatsoever,Original- “The boys, break their necks, tryna creep a little sneak peek”,KB- “The boys break their necks, tryna act a little crazy”,Original- “Sunkissed skin, so hot we’ll melt your popsicle”,KB- “Sunkissed feet, so hot we’ll melt your popsicle”,(So a “popsicle” is appropriate but skin isn’t? And why would they choose feet? Do people often step on popsicles with their feet to melt them? Do the writers just have some kind of foot fetish? Did Rex Ryan have anything to do with this?) ,The Lazy Song by Bruno Mars,Original- “I’ll just strut in my birthday suit, and let everything hang loose”,KB- “I’ll just strut with nothing to do, and let everything fall through”,Original- “Find a really nice girl, have some really nice sex. And she’s gonna scream out this is great”,KB- “Meet a really nice girl, send a really nice text. And she’s gonna write back you’re so great”,The majority of these changes make very little sense within the context of the rest of the song. Often, they replace things that aren’t even “kid-unfriendly” to begin with. These changes are unnecessary, as is the entire Kidz Bop brand. ,According to Billboard magazine, (according to Wikipedia), the Kidz Bop Kids were the #1 kids’ artists of 2010 (ahead of Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, etc.). And they are beating these other kids with worse versions of their songs. The most recent album included songs by Justin Bieber and Willow Smith. I was amazed at how much less musical they were able to make Smith’s “Whip My Hair”. There are clean versions of these songs on iTunes, sung by the actual artists. Parents would be doing their children a great service by sparing them from Kidz Bop and just making them get the clean versions. Nobody can possibly argue that a single Kidz Bop version of any song has more musical value than the original. ,Who is buying this? And why? The only logical demographic I can think of selling this to is pedophiles looking for pump-up CDs to play in their vans on the way to the park. This madness has gone on long enough. Too many people have been hurt. It’s time to put a stop to Kidz Bop.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/why-kidz-bop-has-stop/,"

I always wondered how they organized these games—did they just form organically, or is there some association of casual basketball players that I don’t know about? Either way, I never had the nerve to approach them and ask to join.,Last week, my hall-mate Max stuck his head into my room and asked if I was interested in walking over to Dillon Gym with him. I wasn’t doing anything interesting, so I changed, grabbed a book of poetry to read on a stationary-bike, and headed over. As we entered the gym, I heard the familiar heavy thumps, grunts and screeches coming from the various pick-up games. Just as I was about to retreat to the workout room, one of the players screamed over to Max:,“Yo, you wanna play?”,“Yeah I’ll go in for the next game,” Max responded casually. He then turned to me. “Lil, you want in?”,I instinctively said “oh, no. That wouldn’t end well.” I knew that he was just asking me out of courtesy.,“You sure?” he asked absently, as if he had already accepted my response.,In that moment, something came over me. My frolicsome sixth-grade self erupted through my apathetic college-sophomore exterior. “Actually, yeah. Yeah! I’ll play. If you don’t think they’d mind.” And that’s how I found myself playing in an all-male pick-up game.,At the start of the next game, everyone started matching up with the person they would guard. When I played with girls, I usually matched up with one of the shooting guards (or anyone who wasn’t really tall). However, my former strategy was useless in this context since everyone was four standard deviations taller than me.,So I stood there awkwardly and waited for a guy from the other team to drift over to me. A grad student whose name I did not catch (but I’ll refer to him as Phil for no particular reason) was the only one of the opposing team who wasn’t yet matched up with someone. After exchanging smirks with his fellow teammates, Phil leisurely approached me, swinging his arms heavily at his sides. I have never seen a sarcastic expression of “LOL” executed so brilliantly with body language alone.,As soon as he was within earshot of me, he said the following: “I’ll guard the female. I’m good with the ladies.”,My immediate reaction to this was amusement. I gave a honk-like sarcastic laugh. I had expected that there’d be sexism, and I was kind of glad it was palpable instead of under the surface. In the few moments I had between this statement and the start of the game, I decided that I needed to come up with some sort of comical response.,I responded, “Oh good! Same here.”,I wasn’t really sure what I meant by that— it’s really a cop out in terms of come backs because you could pretty much follow any jab with that line. I guess it implied that I was “good with the ladies” as well.,The game was exhausting. I knew that my only valuable asset was my speed, so I sprinted everywhere, even when I didn’t need to. Even worse, whenever one of the guys would accidentally fling his moist, hairy limbs into my face, he would stop and sincerely apologize. In these moments I felt that I had to offer a little girlish giggle or smirk to assure them that I wasn’t hurt.,My least favorite part was ‘boxing-out.’ If you’ve played basketball before, you know how awkward inter-sex boxing out is. It’s essentially the process of aggressively wedging yourself between your opponent and the basket, so you’ll be able to rebound the ball. If you’re having trouble envisioning this, perhaps the best analogy I can offer is the basement of T.I. on a Saturday night. Whenever a shot was thrown up, I shamelessly maneuvered my butt into Phil’s groins. Despite this act of heroism, I did not get many rebounds.,Throughout the game, Phil proceeded to roll his eyes at me when I guarded him. He was obscenely lazy and hardly moved around but, unfortunately for me, he was a really good shooter.,Eventually, one of my teammates gave me some tips— “don’t be afraid to shove the fuck out of Phil” and “you’re not going to get the ball unless you look like you want the ball.” I was unsure of whether to take these as more unsolicited sexist innuendo or actual advice, but I decided to listen to him. I both “shoved the fuck” out of Phil and clapped when I wanted the ball. They ended up passing to me twice. In both cases, I was wide open, and in both cases, I made the shot. Everyone on my team high fived me shortly after I scored. Although I know they meant well, it came across as patronizing.,I wasn’t sure how I felt about the whole experience. I left the gym drenched in sweat, and lay on my bed, paralyzed with exhaustion for a few hours (note that this is distinct from ‘sleep’). I’m not sure if I was angry with Phil for being an overtly sexist jerk, or if that anger just make me a hypocrite. Maybe his behavior—defending his masculinity by acting like a dude—isn’t so far off from what I was doing; I giggled if someone apologized to me, I felt awkward about being aggressive, and initially I didn’t think I deserved to have the ball passed to me. My insecurity was purely because of my gender; I was acting like a stereotypical girl, which maybe gives Phil every right to treat me like one. Despite this, I’m glad that I played. My height-to-scoring ratio was definitely impressive, confirming my hypothesis that you don’t need testicles to play basketball.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/this-week-in-sports-baskets-and-balls/?replytocom=65,"

      Mar 1, 2013    ",Lily Offit
"The Ivy membership has gathered in the library. One by one, they choose who will fill the positions on the club’s officer board: they elect a male president, a male vice-president, a female bicker chair, and a male social chair. One more position remains: house manager. The competition is between a girl and a boy whose respective campus affiliations wield significant social power in the club. All of a sudden there’s a rumbling, some movement, a dull hum that grows in volume as more and more people chime in. “More girls! more girls! more girls!” The dark-wood-panelled room turns clamorous. “More girls!” The club, with its various affiliations, joins in unity for a brief moment. “More girls!” Order is restored. The members vote. The votes are counted. The male candidate wins.,This year, eating club officers are predominantly male. Not that this year is anything special: the fact that officers are usually guys is just one of those facts of life on the Street that its denizens don’t talk too much about, in the same way no one mentions that the considerable expenses these clubs demand—even with the increased financial aid from the university in upperclassman years—cause significant socioeconomic stratification, or that the racial makeup of the clubs is homogenous, or that affiliations play a huge role in what is billed as a “fair” bicker process. But I digress.,The Steering Committee on Undergraduate Women’s Leadership issued a report in 2011 investigating a perceived lack of female representation in leadership and high-ranking scholarship positions. The 100-page report encompasses much of the gender dynamics present in daily student life, but one of the most striking conclusions the Committee drew was that women occupied plenty of leadership roles on campus, just not the “high-profile ones.” “Despite being less likely than men to stand as candidates for a presidency or other more visible posts,” the report states, “undergraduate women do a large proportion of the important work in the organizations to which they belong.”,Eating clubs are, technically, off-campus, but those students elected to leadership positions have some of the most influential roles on campus, an influence not restricted only to social life. Elections of senior officers, which usually take place towards the end of fall semester or the beginning of spring semester, are characterized by all kinds of political posturing, affiliated muscle-flexing, all-too-frequent devolutions into popularity contests, and—underneath it all—fascinating, complex gender politics. Beyond just a failure in general terms of gender equality, the imbalance in numbers of men and women in officer positions has real consequences, among which are the frequency of sexist themes, the clubs’ subtle codification of what it means to be a “Cloister girl” or a “Terrace girl” or a “Cottage girl” that can feel restrictive and exclusionary, and their failures to adequately address instances of sexual assault.,It is important to remember throughout this article that the Street—and Princeton, for that matter—was an old boys’ club until relatively recently. Princeton only let in women in 1971, and since then, campus has come closer and closer to being a fair place, not just for women, but for anyone who’s not a white Protestant male. That said, Sally Frank had to go to the Supreme Court in 1991 to compel Ivy and Tiger Inn to allow women to join, and considering the social prestige of these clubs, I feel a little sick when I remember they’ve only let women in for barely longer than I’ve been alive. Though now one can look around Princeton and see all kinds of people who never would have been allowed to attend the Princeton of old, that Princeton is ever-present, its appeal happily trumpeted by the administration and much of the student body. In the beautiful old buildings, the ivy-covered walls, the sumptuously carpeted halls of eating clubs, one can almost feel the Princeton that once was. And from these clubs—just as from Princeton—alongside access to experiences and people who will change our lives and make us better, we inherit a legacy of privilege and elitism, a history of intolerance and inequality.,•••,I sought them through websites, through mutual friends, through Facebook, through repeated emails. I promised anonymity, off-the-record conversations, any kind of protection they wanted. I went to Small World, to back rooms in eating clubs I had never set foot in before, to darkened courtyards outside libraries. And I found them—not all of them, but some of them—the women who had been elected to eating club officerships for the coming year. They told vastly different stories and expressed vastly different frustrations and hopes: each club is a microcosm of its own gendered expectations, after all. My hope in this article is to highlight specific themes and patterns in how female officers deal with the inequalities that their position includes—and how the clubs deal with their female officers—in the hopes of bringing to light some of the underlying issues in these clubs. I don’t want to condemn specific eating clubs (they all have pretty tortured gender dynamics) nor editorialize the experience of anyone who agreed to talk to me. Part of the reason discussing gender dynamics is so important is that they’re so hard to talk about: they’re so subtle, so insidious, that sometimes we forget they’re even there.,All but one female officer wanted anonymity. This was partly because of grad board bullying (in many clubs, the president is the only one who is allowed to speak to the press), but partly due to worries about ruining the dynamic in what more often than not was a majority male officer corps: they didn’t want to be the girl who had run to a reporter to complain about the people she would be living with next year. Some, like Claire Liu from Cloister, just didn’t agree with the angle of my article. “I don’t feel that gender was a factor in my election or decision to run,” she wrote back to me. “Feel free to quote me on anything I’ve said.”,Claire’s comment prompted a lot of murmurs of approbation from the women I spoke to, but the numbers suggest that something is going on here. Princeton is about 49% female, but by compiling lists of the eating club officers I’ve calculated that—depending on who you count as an officer—only a third of eating club officers are women (33-35%). There is only one female president: Sarah Pak, of Colonial. All of the eating clubs (except Colonial if you count only what they call the “Top 5” officers: president, vice-president, social chair, house manager, and treasurer) have more male than female officers. In Colonial’s Top 5, they have more female than male officers: in fact, females are in their top three positions: president, vice-president, and social chair. But the entirety of their officer corps has more male than female officers, though the relative power of these positions diminishes as you move downwards.,This “Top 5” structure is how many of the eating clubs work. Most clubs have a “Top 5” whether nominal or not, and then a series of lower-ranking officers, in positions like “Liquid Assets Chair,” “IM Chair, and “Activities Chair” These top five (or six) are usually: president, vice president, social chair, house manager, treasurer, with maybe another one thrown in for good measure. These are the people who get to live in the club, who get ICC stickers, who represent the club to both alumni and membership. They make a kind of mind-boggling commitment, out of love for the club and hope for it to be better, assume legal responsibility, agree to giving up several of their nights a week so they can be present at social events, deal with members, grad board, alumni. Everyone says it’s fun. I’ll take their word for it.,•••,Over the course of about a month, I spoke to seven female officers (though I contacted—and was ignored by—many more). In this article, they all, except for one, have pseudonyms, and much of what they told me was off-the-record. Many of what will seem to be wild assertions are based in facts from conversations with the officers, though I cannot name specific events. Goldie, Fern, Ruby and Melody are officers of selective clubs; Robin and Hazel are officers of sign-ins, as is Miriam Pearsall, but that’s actually her name and she’s letting me quote her and say her exact position, and her club, which is Colonial.,Most officers I talked to shared a goal of wanting to make their respective clubs better places overall, but a few specifically highlighted the desire to make it a safer place for women. Several women recount tales of dealing with issues of sexual assault in their club, especially when it comes to legitimizing the experience of the victim and making sure appropriate measures are taken to prevent such instances from happening in the future. The position of TI “safety czar” was implemented in 2008 after a TI alum sued the club because she was sexually assaulted during pickups. Safety czar is usually a girl, and part of her responsibility is to make sure no one gets too drunk or assaulted on the dance floor; that no one passes out; that no one needs to go the hospital. TI isn’t alone in taking measures like this. Most clubs make sure they have one male and one female on duty at all times to go into bathrooms and make sure everything’s okay in there, that no one’s slumped by the toilet, forgotten by equally drunk friends, needing help. “That’s something that boys are really good about, too,” Ruby—an officer of a selective club—tells me. “It’s not just girls.” Hazel, an officer of a sign-in club, nonetheless stresses that this is one of the most important ways a girl can be involved in her eating club, and one of the most important reasons to make sure more females are elected to officer positions: for the safety of everyone in the club, whether they’re members or guests.,Another way female officers seek to mitigate the gendered tensions of their social scenes is through themes. Ruby says she tries really, really hard to ignore “…and Sluts/Hos” themes when organizing an event. (Examples of past themes of this ilk—from multiple clubs—include: Rubik’s Cubes and Sluts, Jedis and Sluts, ConquistaBros and NavaHos, and one eating club even received the suggestion of “Dinosaurs and Sluts”). “It’s really hard,” Melody says, “because some girls find it offensive, but then other girls want to dress provocatively.” This is one of the issues facing modern feminism today: is the sexualization and objectification of the female body a means of domination or liberation? How do we decide?,•••,Of course, any election is political, and gender dynamics aren’t always the most direct cause of the gender imbalance in eating club officers. One of the most common reasons I hear for girls not being elected is that guys are “just better” at organizing voting blocs, especially through frats. This is an issue that comes up over and over again, especially in selective clubs that are made up largely of affiliations, be they fraternities, sororities, sports teams, or other extracurricular groups. The nature of frats and sororities especially is such that frats create what are assumed to be tight groups of guy friends, who all “have each others’ backs” and whose friendships seem legitimate, strong, according to Goldie, an officer of a selective club with a significant Greek population. Sororities, however—massive amalgamations of over a hundred girls—are not perceived as such, partly because of their size and partly because “sorority girl” often codes for “shallow social climber.” In one selective club, a sophomore tells me, there was a close race between an affiliated girl and an affiliated guy this year. Girls of another sorority, the rumor goes, pooled their votes to vote for the guy, seemingly reasoning it would be better to have a male officer than a girl of a rival affiliation, though many of these same girls had articulated very clearly earlier that the club needed more girl officers. What they meant, it seems, is that they wanted more girls from their affiliation. Better a boy than their competition.,Guys, it seems, can get away with this partisanship more than girls can. “When girls stick together it’s perceived as more about social status than anything else,” Goldie explains to me, “whereas with guys it’s like, ‘oh, they’re brothers.’” In elections, she says, “girls are perceived as wanting a position for the wrong reasons, people think they want it to go one step further in social power,” whereas with guys there’s none of this. “They just think he’s probably a really good guy and that he cares about the club.” This applies to campaigning, too: no clubs have articulated rules about campaigning, but there are many subtle ways one can make it clear that one is interested in a officer position. With girls, these signs—being friendlier than usual, hanging around the club more—are often mocked in Goldie’s club, where with guys it’s not even mentioned.,In one selective club—in which Ruby tells me that “[affiliated] guys definitely want to see one of their own as president,”—this kind of behavior would be met with suspicion. “If a guy was suddenly, like, being super friendly, you would know it was because they were running. With girls, it was just what we would do anyway.” While this is nice for those girls who are super friendly, it implies that only popular girls run in the first place. With guys, the playing field seems to be more level: you don’t have to be gregarious and amiable to get elected. Instead, you just have to be flanked by an army of friends, and you only have to be nice to people for a couple weeks, until you’re elected. Then, it all can go back to normal, guys being taciturn and girls doing everything they can to be universally liked.,Fern, whose selective club is also marked by a significant amount of affiliated members, recounts a remark she heard an older member make in the couple months leading up to elections. A group of members were discussing who would run and who would win, and someone expressed a hope there might be a girl president. This older girl, Fern says, laughed and said “Why would I waste my vote on a girl when she would never get elected anyway?” Fern lowers her voice and holds my gaze. “Listen,” she says, punctuating each word by pressing her hand against the table. “Boys are not the reason that girls aren’t getting elected. Girls are the reason girls aren’t getting elected.”,•••,The work girls put into being perceived as friendly and approachable may be exactly why they aren’t elected to the head positions. Over and over again, girls tell me that there is an expectation that the president will be a boy. I hear it from female officers of sign-in clubs and selective clubs, athletes, sorority girls, and unaffiliated girls. Especially in the cases of girls who ran for a more powerful role than what they,eventually were appointed or elected to (and this is the story of almost every female officer—and symptomatic of the way elections work anyway—you start from the top and work your way down) one of the big reasons these women think they didn’t win president, or vice-president, or any of the subsequent positions, is that they just didn’t “seem” like presidential material. They don’t say that necessarily codes for “man,” but the suggestion is obvious. The girls are confident, and maintain they would have been just as good in a more powerful position as they are going to be in the one they were elected to, (they all stress they are happy in their current ones, and seem it) but they know that they were, just by virtue of being female, fighting a losing battle. Colonial was the only eating club with a female president last year, and some of the other clubs have had at least one female president in recent memory (except Cannon). When this class ran, though, there were no female presidential shoes to fill. The glass ceiling, which had been cracked in years past, was newly smooth, imperfection-free.,That said, according to Fern, “nobody thinks it’s okay to have no female officers.” In another eating club, I hear, a position that was usually held by a girl was held by a guy last year. During elections, at least half the club heard him say it would be better for a girl to have it. Realizing he’d made a faux-pas, he backtracked, saying he just meant that girls were kinder, better with people (a girl would eventually be elected to it). This idea of girls’ kindness suiting them for some positions is the classic double-standard: it’s exactly this that (male) opponents use to imply they wouldn’t be good in more powerful positions. The well-liked women who run for these positions are sometimes called out for being too friendly, too kind, and sometimes people wonder loudly whether—given their girl’s history of being amiable, likable—they’d be able to assert themselves where it matters. As sexist views usually are, this proves inconsistent. Female officers report over and over again feeling that they do more work than their male counterparts and take their position “more seriously,” and that they receive more backlash when they assert themselves than guys do.,Fern, when asked why she thinks fewer girls run in the first place, mentioned that she thinks girls take commitments more seriously. Being an eating club officer involves legal responsibility and social and extracurricular sacrifices that it takes a certain kind of person to make. “I had to carefully consider the impact being an officer would have on my academics, and I’m involved in a lot of activities. The list of people willing to make that kind of commitment is very small,” Fern says.,Another officer of a selective club agrees. “There’s just an impression that guys can handle it, more,” Lucretia says. Goldie tells the story of the time when an election came down to a very close call between a boy and a girl, and many members of the club worried aloud that the girl might be overcommitted, though no one had even mentioned this concern when a popular, busy frat boy was elected to another position.,•••,Another matter is how these female officers create an identity within their respective positions. The girls I talk to uniformly express irritation with the reflection of their power they see in the eyes of the people who voted for (or against) them. Goldie is irritated that people keep calling her “HBIC,” a popular acronym for “Head Bitch in Charge,” usually meant to gently mock women who decide they’re calling the shots, and then do so. “It kind of made me livid that because I’m a woman in power I’m a bitch, just because I have ideas and opinions and an authoritative position and don’t take bullshit. ‘Bitch’ is used pretty colloquially these days, but it still makes me crazy,” she says. She mostly hears it from girls, and says she cannot help but hear derision in it.,This is echoed by Ruby, who just has embraced the fact that her outspoken, no-nonsense nature means that people are going to comment on it. “I’m a sassy bitch,” she remarks in a joking way, but she admits she’s being truthful. She’s aware that’s how she’s perceived, so she tries to soften her tone in the emails she sends to her eating club, and how she takes care of her tasks.,But if you’re not a bitch, you’re also a kind of maternal figure. “I’ve been called a mom before,” Melody says. Robin, an officer of a sign-in club, embraces the identifier, saying “I behave like a mom, making sure people are nice by just being nice, plus I know where everyone’s shit is.” Girls are supposed to be more responsible, cleaner, more considerate. And none of these are bad things: Hazel—who mentioned that, during elections, she got the idea that she was understood to be “nurturing,”—wishes that those characteristics didn’t necessarily code for second, third, or fourth in command. “There’s no reason you can’t be nurturing and not also be a good leader,” she says. But that’s what people seem to think.,Melody, who proudly calls herself a feminist (the only girl I speak to who offers this self-identifier of her own accord, though I did not ask the others), also voices frustration with this bitch/mom complex. She’s well-known in her club for her outspoken views on feminism, but—she says—“I’m really girly, and sometimes that means people don’t take me seriously.” Another irritation is the mocking she’ll get for doing certain things—say, wearing make-up or liking pink. “That’s not feminist!” people say to her. Melody rolls her eyes when she recounts these interactions. “It’s not about doing stuff that guys would do,” she says. “It’s about girly things being okay to do.”,Melody mentions emails as a particular medium through which she tries to gain respect, and the issue of emails is a loaded one for female officers. The primary way they communicate with their clubs, they have to strike just the right balance: warrant respect, but still seem approachable, but not in a way that makes them seem like a pushover. Almost every female officer tells me that in emails guys get away with a kind of humor that’s unreachable for girls, a mix of bullying and sex jokes, underpinned by a constant kind of fratty ethos about raging face that it’s harder for girls to pull off. For those who don’t send out social emails, the challenge is “not looking like an aggressive bitch,” Ruby says. “I’m always trying to add exclamation points.” Melody, however, says that her tendency to use exclamation points means that she loses respect.,•••,In comparison to the failures of other eating clubs to fairly and equally represent their female members, Colonial Club seems like a dream come true. Where some female officers were dismissed in elections as too “nurturing,” relegated to vice-president because that was a “subordinate” position, Colonial has filled their highest-ranking positions with three women. Colonial has a history of progressivism: they were the first club on the Street to allow women membership and the first non-bicker club. This is something they’re really proud of, Miriam Pearsall, the social chair, says, and the tradition of equality continues today with the club’s reputation as “the Asian one,” something of which everyone in the club is very conscious. Not everyone in the club is Asian, of course, but the perception of the club as such is essential to its identity, whether in the embrace or rejection of it.,Though what it’s like to be Asian on this campus does not fall within the scope of this article—and certainly not the personal experience of its author—I have been shocked to see and to hear from Asian and Asian-American friends the prejudices they confront on a daily basis. These dynamics have received more and more attention in recent years, from major news outlets like the New York Times and student-led initiatives at colleges like Duke, meant to push back against these problems, but still, there is a lot of work left to be done. It fits right into Colonial’s ethos of progressivity and acceptance that a group of people who have had to confront a never-ending stream of campus prejudice find themselves here, where people just like this have found themselves for decades, now.,“Colonial’s Asian stereotype is for some reason seen as negative,” Miriam says. Members are well aware, and race was something that came up frequently—though obliquely—during elections. “I remember someone asked me a specific question about how I would convince someone that they should come here and I remember saying, well, it’s not about race. People here are very diverse in their own ways, part of different parts of campus, different talents … and in the end personality transcends race.” Miriam is black, something she acknowledges is surprising for a club stereotyped to be full of Asians. She is one of few black officers overall (the racial makeup of eating club officers, too, is a topic for a whole other article.) “It’s really interesting to me how our officer corps doesn’t really represent the demographic of the club,” Miriam says.,Miriam ran against a boy in a frat and people who had been officers for parts of their sophomore year, which she had not. In the elections, she was the underdog. Her election is a testament both to her charisma and passion and the fairness of Colonial’s elections. She is proud to be one of the few black officers in Colonial’s history and on the Street but knows this is a problem. “The people I’ve talked to in the black community are pretty vocal in how they don’t feel welcome in a bunch of eating clubs, and it seems wrong to me that certain areas are off-limits for people still, even if it’s implied,” she says. “There’s this invisible barrier [that] is really unfortunate, and perpetuates a lot of misunderstandings and exclusion.”,This is not something that other clubs are often forced to confront, given the their overwhelming homogeneity. It seems that constantly confronting the prejudices of others has led Colonial’s members to create a more inclusive climate. “There were people who applied for certain positions and in other clubs they wouldn’t even consider them,” Miriam claims, “but we consider the holistic view. At other clubs it’s more about your image of being a partier.”,It’s easy for one eating club to criticize another, but I think Miriam might be on to something. In other clubs (and in Colonial, too, I’m sure) there’s a real concern with how the officers will make the clubs look. It’s just that, in Colonial’s case, it wants to look accepting, open, and progressive, so it’s easier for females (and un-affiliated, non-white females, no less!) to be elected. But in other clubs, the history they’re so proud of is a history of all-male uber-selectivity, wealth, and social prestige. And that’s the reason, I think, that many of the female officers I talked to are the kinds of girls who are confident enough to demand what is still not a traditional role for women, and qualified enough to earn it, and also pretty attractive. They’re the kinds of girls straight guys probably want to have sex with, but if that’s not going to happen they’re fine with just hanging out with them. Many of the girls I spoke to were “chill,” that definitionless, omnipresent word that reveals more about the person saying it than the person called it. A “chill” person is just a person who doesn’t stress you out. And girls—it is clear—stress people out.,When “chill” is used to describe a girl it means she’s not high-strung, not self-promoting. She probably smokes weed or can chug a beer. In Terrace, where I am a member, it’s a word that I am told used to be used in a desperate, searching sense: “Where are the girl chillers?” dudes would bellow down the hallways, waving around pitchers of beer. “WHERE ARE THE GIRL CHILLERS?” Since then, they have appeared: girls who smoke, girls who hang, girls who drink beer, girls who aren’t worried so much about their hair or their dresses or their romantic lives that they kill dudes’ vibes, girls who—effectively—have capitulated without complaint to male forms of socializing. In a way, being “chill” is a status symbol, a mark of social privilege: guys can “chill” because things are easier for them, because girls—in every part of campus—are still trying to prove themselves equal to a standard guys have set, because to be a well-liked girl used to mean being a girl immaculately dressed and well-mannered, a light and fascinating conversationalist, filled with all kinds of amusing and diverting skills, and that meant girls were often stressed out. In their attempts to be the kind of girls guys would want to be around, they became the exact opposite. Now, guys say, it’s time to chill out.,•••,I ask many of the officers I talk to articulate what the stereotype of the typical girl in their eating club is—and with the exception of one of the most elitist clubs on the Street (guess which)—the answer is usually “girls who don’t take themselves too seriously,” or “girls who can take a joke,” or “girls who are comfortable with themselves.” When I asked the same question about guys, I usually received something along the lines of “smart, funny,” and then the respective affiliation that characterized the eating club, whether it was “athlete” or “frat bro” or “theater person.” This difference could be attributed to the fact that I only spoke to female officers—guys surely feel pressure to present a kind of maleness that girls are less able to articulate—but the definition of what makes an “X Eating Club Girl” rests on the apparent achievement of the girls to be a different kind of girl than “the average one,” who—I suppose—must be defined by opposites: unchill, unable to take a joke, uncomfortable with themselves.,Every female officer I spoke to was friendly, open, intelligent, articulate—and a little jumpy, a little nervous. Much of it was just anxiety about being interviewed, but much of it was because they were saying, out loud, what you’re not really allowed to say as a woman, these days, especially if you’ve been elected to a representative position by a group of your peers: that you really, really are worried about being liked.,I ask all of them whether they’re worried about moving into a house full of dudes for the next year, and they all gently roll their eyes at me. I ask them whether they’re worried about living in what is essentially a frat house, where wasted and inconsiderate people come to be belligerent, and they smile and say that doesn’t scare them either. They’re not afraid of alums or grad boards. No: Melody tells me that “the most terrifying part is not doing a good job and having people not like you,” but Ruby tells me that it’s “doing your job and having people not like you because of it.” Both of those sound about right.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the-girls-in-charge-of-the-old-boys-clubs/?replytocom=115529,"

"I stand on the Mount of Olives and face West, toward the Temple Mount. The Dome of the Rock loafs on the opposite ridge, behind the Old City’s nearer retaining wall, golden and blue, bulbous, immense. Legend recalls the sixth day of the new world, when, out of the ready dirt of this very ridge, God manifested the form of First Man, realizing at last the light-thought asleep in his basic eyes. Years later, when the Mount was named Moriah, Abram and Isaac, his son, traveled for three days to the center of its summit. A patch of knotty twine grew there. An imperfect stone early laid by the Lord to demark the ground of Adam waited beside it. In supreme devotion, the father bound his son to the stone. He held his son’s perspiring forehead to the stone. He looked across the mountain to the East and beheld the lavender smoke rising from the Valley of Hinnom. It was mid-day, and Abram removed his dirty robe and then his sandals softly from his feet, bending then to do the same for his son. He with a tug removed a small dagger from a slit in the side of the stone. He held its sharp side over his son’s neck. As light reverting through a prism, his own figure appeared to Abram in repose on the stone, a blank, brilliant figure, the absence of the world, purely light, writhing. Through the same blade, Isaac saw his father above him in undifferentiated lavender. Abram lifted his heaped robe and wiped down the dagger’s blade. He held it once more over his son’s neck. He then plunged it swiftly into his torso, which was suffused with light from inside, like a lamp, from an undetermined dark place, and plunged it again and once more. With the skill of a mason, with the dagger’s tip, Abram traced the lineaments of his rib cage. Then, he returned the dagger to its prior slit. He robed himself, then. Then, with a small, still voice, Abram summoned his son to stand, and he did, and the two men followed their blank eyes down the mountainside. ,Another legend, which in antiquity blossomed amongst that twine, holds that, on the day of the coming of the Messiah, the hundred-thousand dead waiting in this mountainside will rise and soar, speeding through space, in the direction of that mountain. Abram will stand there with Isaac to greet them. The blaring noise of the end of days shall deafen every man still in life, and the earth shall seize and unfix all which is fixed. The entire sky shall disappear in light. Then, as the radiant, ecstatic souls flow toward their place of final rest, the force Gog and the force Magog, whose mythical conflict sustains this world, shall at last resolve themselves in the valley below.  The valley is Yehoshaphat, for what shall then transpire here is the prosecution of the Lord’s final judgment.   ,I stand on the mountain in the heat of the morning sun. I stand mid-way between its parabolic crest and its base, barely in the crack between two supine marble graves, toeing the dry dirt, eyeing their etching. Another hundred thousand graves of the same marble unfurl low across the face of the mountain, like the imprint of a ragged lithograph. The face of the visible earth is white, a hot, dry winter, a sea-shell in the sand.  No tree stands here to offer shade. No brook meanders from the summit. ,Somewhere on the face of this earth my great-great-grandfather, the Rabbi Yosef Michel Newberger, is buried and has been since November 1, 1933. His grandson, my grandfather, Phillip, whom I never met, was three days from his fourth birthday; more than six decades later, nascent I would also be three days from birth, awaiting respiration and first sight. When I first knew anything, I knew that I shared my grandfather’s birthday, but only when I began researching to visit Yosef Michel’s grave did I discover his end was so nearby. On the lunar Hebrew calendar, I found it was in fact the same day, the eighth of Cheshvan. I was caught. I wondered about the significance for my self of this arrangement, the present, spiritual implications of this ancestry, the aura of early November. Christianity has famously taught the meaning of its three days. And, in Judaism, the first three days of shivah—the initial mourning week—have their grief endowed with an aspect of cosmic sundering. I feel not myself asunder from their memories. I feel and hardly feel myself bound to them invisibly, as though by an invisible twine, as though by two thin filaments from Eden, which in those who breathe may fasten themselves only in the soul of souls.  For perhaps years stack on top of one another, aligning the same days. Or perhaps generations do. Perhaps the souls of kin already constellate themselves closely in heaven, and in the gestating core of things. Perhaps these sons know certain grandfathers and those know certain others more intimately, for, indeed, I take my Hebrew name from the Yiddish name of my paternal grandfather, the same Phillip—and what does that mean? Suppose each time I am summoned by it his spirit breaks through into this world, or, perhaps, there opens an abyss into the space where he now resides, which then illuminates my life for a week. His name was Avraham Feivel, Feivel in that language a candle. My name is Avner, uniting the words for father and candle, each of us, in differing ways, by it becoming in my ongoing life father-of-light. My own father, by blessing me with it, carried his eternal candle into my deepest places. Perhaps my grandfather, Phillip, knew my name before it was. Perhaps he and Yosef Michel imagined my being before they could no longer breathe, and it was out of those dreams that I became. Perhaps I became in their final breath. Perhaps, perhaps, so much perhaps, but I do not worry. Who could deny the weight of a name, when in such light it comes soaring on? Who would deny the real weight of this inheritance? My very fingers are heavy from it having typed. ,I had come to the Mount of Olives to find Yosef Michel’s grave—to see and touch it, to relay its engraving to my father and great-uncle, to ensure its upkeep for them. When in past years I traveled to this country, I did not muster the energy to visit it. Leaders of school trips in 2006 and two years later who forbade West Bank and lonesome amble, and the gun-slung security that everywhere accompanied, erected fear before everything before every instinct. The Mount of Olives is in East Jerusalem and is disputed and, they said, dangerous. So, though a relative who knows the whereabouts of the grave thereabouts resides and offered to guide, I decapitated myself and did not go. Other friends have spent weeks in Hebron and Bethlehem and Jenin. I once lengthened one toe across a bridge across a sewage crook demarking the Green Line and retreated quickly. But unaccompanied Tel-Aviv last summer and Jerusalem this have eased this negativity in me. I wander the country unworried, now, blithe, unburdened. Ascending and descending the present mountains and descending into the craters and tunnels, I possess joy as it was first possessed. I pass by all sorts of fellows and wave. I play soccer each night with Israelis and with Arabs, twin blind Lordly same-speaking indigenous nations, and do not speak and do run and grunt and drink water from the same fountain of water as them, and my body is harder and more vigorous each day. In the markets of the city, I delight in Mehjool dates from East and West in equal measure, and in the sweet honey and the paste they sweetly give forth. My teeth are strong, and so I delight in figs. I delight in fried chick peas and chick peas and fava beans, and I dip them in the olive oil pooling on my plate. I delight in tomatoes and cucumbers and onions finely cut. I can see the very ground from which they came. In the evenings, I eat fresh pastries of honey and filo dough and fruit and cheer in them, too. I dine with others and alone and all is well if I am alone and also if I am not. ,But my wandering remains bounded, for I laze and live well in imaginations. Worlds which exist only in the word and thought of any single man or woman—I—which being timeless and pure are surely the strongest worlds, are the first destination of the adventuresome aspect of my mind, which exposes their strength by riding their endless unraveling into reality. Such is the worldly strength of the imagination that in every moment it grips between thumb and forefinger the so-called real world of ordinary life and swiftly shucks it, disclosing—to the astonishment of the spectator—the presence of the world it created on its own accord, the very world the spectator had rejected as ‘ideal’.  Reading and thinking shuck the closest shells.  The world that was thought to be known, the world visible from the minor limit of sight to the midnight boundaries of the ferry-bed, is perennially revealed as a shell; and each time the world of the recent imagination in fine color emerges. ,On this understanding, holding, out of the evocative fruit of the Mountain’s name, a strong interior image of it and the grave, with a grip that was often in need of hasty reinforcement, I had believed that the loss in mind a step on its ground would inflict would exceed the gain in mind brought on by the sight of the ground itself—of the grave itself. In those earlier years’ travels, Emerson had not yet taught me the imaginative worth of the concrete world, nor had I read the Russian filmmaker Tarkovsky—who was more influential—insisting on simple, direct observation of the material world as the inward pressure through which the ordinary self might be transcended, the realm of the spirit then being accessed. Tarkovsky illustrates this process of condensation by haiku-quote: ,The stumps now stand forgotten,Sprinkled with soft snow.,As lonesome wandering had begun to expel my fears, these men deflated my idea of the imagination and linked its more vital remnants with an idea of perception. In this recent shade, of a year or so, I was receptive to, and indeed interested in, visiting the Mountain. Coincidentally, Menachem Begin—the unfortunate, political man I am researching this summer, a former Prime Minister of the State—happens to be buried on the same mountainside as my great-great-grandfather, though in a different ridge, apart from the general scrum. Shirking West Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl and trees, where nearly every other Prime Minister lies in distinguished repose, he wished to be buried in the hot shell of this Mount alongside the corpses of two men, Meir Feinstein and Moshe Barazani. Feinstein and Barazani, like Begin, were members of the terrorist underground who fought the British occupation in this land before 1947. They were caught and sentenced to death. Feinstein and Barazani preempted that judgment and, embracing in their cell, disintegrated their own flesh with the ignition of two fresh oranges packed with explosives, hidden until then in the crook of the back corner. What flesh remained made its way in serpents in caskets to this conspicuous hillside at night. In their honor, Begin had his body deposited in the same ground. My research group decided travel to Begin’s grave in his honor, to see it and, I suppose, to pay what respect we had. ,I decided with ease to travel with them. But I traveled earlier than they, so I could see my great-great-grandfather’s grave and then meet them at Begin’s. It was Wednesday morning. A friend and I took an eight-thirty cab from this German Colony, all around the Old City, through East Jerusalem and halfway up the Jericho Road, which is cut halfway into the side of the Mount. A small shack proclaiming itself an Information Center there stood, but it did not inform. It only allowed us to peek askance over the near railing. There, I saw the Christian graves’ soft and grassy bed. We crossed the road and entered the Jewish cemetery’s central gate and began up its central stone path, the Path of the Kohanim, separated from the cemetery itself by strong, tall walls, for the Jewish priests—the Kohanim—were kept by religious prohibition from walking among the dead. We quickly came to a locked gate, a forestry green and not shell, which pronounced the Prophets’ Section as its preserve. I vaguely recalled this as the preserve of my great-great-grandfather. I pulled and pushed on the gate. It was locked. ,Below its grand heading, a smaller sign, a true kindergarten sticker, said to call a man named Abed. Below this one, another quietly offered the phone number of the chevra kadisha, the ritual committee in charge of burials. I called Abed. A man picked up and quickly began speaking quick Arabic. He said what he said with increasing volume.  The more considerate request I had devised made somewhat inappropriate by his introduction, I, flustered, in slow Hebrew, over and again asked him to please—calm down, and to please—come open the Prophets’ Section for me, so I might visit my grandfather’s grave. Please, I said—the gate is locked; the gate says you have the key; please—come open the gate. [Perhaps there was something pleasing to our rhythmic interplay, his voice, accelerating and constant, and mine, an intentional, intermittent molasses to it.] He slowed himself gradually, a process inverse to him listening and understanding my request. Ah!—he had understood. He would come shortly. ,The sun was out. The wall was tall but never enough. The shell began to burn as the graves. My mozzarella skin began to burn and turn rosy. We stood tightly against the retaining wall, which was cold, but my unfortunate head peeked over and burned. We waited fifteen minutes, and Abed did not come. I called again. Panting, he said he was on his way. We waited another fifteen minutes. He came then, sweating and panting, a long rag wrapped around his neck and dark face, tucked under a baseball cap, protecting him from the sun.  He was short. The rag dangled halfway to his waist, streaked with dust and sweat admixed. The rag and the shirt he wore and the pants he had crammed its rim into were white, or had been, or maybe never had been, having already accumulated this land’s universal dust into its cotton stitches’ thin interstices on the shelf of the shop of the merchant, who in search of impeccable air would never close his door. His mustache bushed from nose to lip, like a row of fat black shrubs, wasted on a hill in the borderlands nearby. Where it was exposed, his skin was various shades of too-toasted toast.,Two toasted Frenchmen passed us on the path and muttered. Muttering under his bush-lip, Abed passed us and unlocked the padlock on the gate and unlatched it and, opening it, seized from my hands the pack of folded papers I held, unfolding them then. They were the directions, the variety of directions, to the grave, which I had found—online—or been given—by my great-uncle, who had visited many years prior. They were written in English, and in the quick, teetering script of my right hand. Abed, unfamiliar with the language, struggled to understand what was written, scoffing and discarding the sheets in turn. At the bottom of the papers was, however, a single map of the cemetery, where I had inkily marked what I supposed to be the location of the grave. At this, he nodded. He pointed far ahead in the plot; we, three, followed his finger.,The white graves were everywhere before us, by their surfeit or poor deployment having long ago abandoned any strict principle of organization. Their stones did not stand, as they did in the American cemeteries I knew; instead, they rested flat, on a solid block of different stone, parallel to the ground and the sky. There was no space for grass to stand between them and bless them and lend shade, as respectful blades often would back home. There was hardly room for families to confer respects. I squinted to see how they might. ,Often opposingly angled, such that a left arm of one dead man may once have contacted a another’s right nostril, and pluming dust from their misalignment, the graves, which in this section alone numbered in the tens of thousands, were nonetheless an irrefutable manifestation of serenity—the serenity of death, of the last repose. I alone, I, the sweaty visitor, sweaty searcher, kinsman, pilgrim, knew their designed anxiety, for they were at ease. For me, hot, white stone was all. For me, the graves ran together and ignited with speed. I could not rest as they could, as the stones could, as what remained below the stones could, and, furthermore, as the long-indifferent mountain could, and as could the sun, lazily sitting, profligately, irreverently beaming itself. And yet the bothers of this mountainside—the dust, the heat and sun, endless death concealed—could not bother and, though appearing in every blink, did not enter into my second, deeper mind. I observed them as though I were dead or asleep. I knew little of the sweat of the valley of my back, of the disorder, and even less of the many dust which would so otherwise often bring on a wheeze. The shade of my great-great-grandfather, which was long, slung itself on me and before me, and, in this calm optimism, I forwarded a foot.   ,Unfortunately, and more unfortunately for my friend, whose feet in sandals were, Abed had already forwarded a score or so, sprinting as he did, leaping from grave-top to grave-top as though they were roof-tops. I cringed at each landing. A grave was a small sanctum. A rock and a flower were to be placed gently at its head. An absolute, holy, private dominion was to be held over an ancestor’s grave by those who still lived. A foot, a dusty foot, was not to be set upon it. Abed turned from his distant turn and yelled something in Arabic, beckoning with his one hand for us to follow. I divided for a moment. But I supposed the dead would not be bothered below their shields of resolute stone and sediment; and what reservations I had were further loosed when he wandered so heedlessly. I needed to visit my own dead, to confer my particular respects to him while I could, and I needed Abed’s guidance. I began sprinting after him, deliberately falling my feet more gingerly, and on paths where possible.,We came in time to the dusty corner where he thought the grave was. The sun was higher and hotter. The graves were more white, hot. We carefully scanned the sector and could not find it. On the graves, many years’ silt obscured the sense of their writing, and so the scan was slow and arduous and squinting. But it was not there. A yellowing picture of the grave and its inscription my father had sent me from when he last visited, in 1978, served to confirm this, though I had not brought it with me and only remembered. We did find a Yosef Michel—one is bound to in these many thousands—but he was of a different father. Exasperated and exhausted, Abed wiped his brow with the dangling rag and shook his head. He had been certain. He wiped his brow with his thick hand. He summoned by name, Ibrahim I recall, one of the many workers, who were meticulously cleaning the graves in the next sector with miniature pickaxes. Ibrahim gathered his bucket—with pickaxe, paint and brush, and a contact card for the chevre kadisha—and came running to where we were, leaping grave to grave and over the iron fence between. He was stockier than Abed, more burnt in the absence of a headscarf, his off-white shirt and pants dripping the black color he—I later learned—used to vivify graves’ inscriptions for visitors’ pictures. The two men, concerned, conferred. They pointed in many directions with a few fingers. Their pointing fingers rose more slowly each time, more gently, as departed surety and sense. ,Soon, the second man ran off. Soon, he returned with a third, a rotund, bearded fellow, who nodded graciously when he came. He pointed up the mountain and said something in Arabic with which the two others concurred. A light began soon to his corner-lip and in the corner of his left eye, and could be heard in the excited “come!” he summoned us with, as he began a familiar sprint across and over and up. We leapt grave to grave, and climbed over a sedimentary retaining wall, passing further workers who chipped away. Eventually, we came to the grave of Rav Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine and still a revered figure among religious Zionists. It was for his friendship with Kook that my great-great-grandfather was afforded the privilege of this burial ground, and he was laid to rest nearby. ,I recall strongly my first sight of the stone grave under which Yosef Michel long ago became humble member of the dirt, humble assistant to the earlier passed in fulfilling the sanctification of the soil which is their fate and function, and which will be ours. A moment of reception, when I read his headstone and confirmed, was quickly surpassed by generation. I read his name and his father’s name—Avraham. I read the date of his death, which was the date of my Hebrew birth. The confirmation that this was certainly it freed many imaginaries and colorful images of this aligned man that had been gestating between my skulls, letting their factual bloom in the healthy light of what was engraved. They would be allowed to dance freely in the world. For this land was their self-appropriate land, and it would receive them kindly. ,As though preordained, a sudden vision of the greatest stability occupied my both eyes. In its presence, and in my sense of my presence in it, in the extent of its cast and the reality of what motion in it transpires, it has by another vision not once been surpassed. I saw in this second moment Yosef Michel’s burial—on November 1, 1933. The clouds were sat above the old city and here, shading grayly the mountainside. A thin storm threatened and could be smelt.  Invisible and weightless, I stood twenty graves across and four graves up from the one that would receive his body. A shuffling crowd of men who surrounded the cut hole yielded to the will of my sight and held the closed casket aloft. Their beards were long and ash. Their draped overcoats possessed in their silk the sky’s impending light, and on each of their heads a precarious fur shtreimel tipped, tall, sleek, square. In that year, vegetation remained on this hard slope, and the darkest reeds—I can imagine the darkest barley, their darker heads—rocked between coattails in the benevolent breeze. A general haze circumscribed the space of these sharp forms and presented them in ever greater relief. Once, a measure of pinkish smoke blended with it to the far South—deep in its dimensions. I cannot be sure, for each remembering has brought a different truth, but as this shade dissolved or was driven off, a herd of ten thousand steeds, as sleek as midnight’s dagger, may have flown swiftly in the same direction, surmounting the cragged ridge and passing without sound into the abyss beyond.  The fur of the straggling colts was tinged faintly red.   ,This vision was of mythical time, image following image in its perfect maturation. I did not feel its length. After the herd’s glorious traversal of the scene, the plywood casket was lowered into the ground. In the hands of every man, it appeared to float into the earth, with balanced tension descending. But when it contacted the bottom of the grave and a vital crack transpierced the every valley, a subsequent vital crack contacted the walls of the Old City and rebounded many minor cracks through its lapidary, labyrinthine ways. As though to contain these difficult sounds, the invisible, visible hands of the severe men began sliding the stone over the cut hole, to seal him in, to allow his inevitable communion an early consummation. I had a contravening impulse: a strong sense of soaring toward the closing cut hole overtook me. It was a strong sense of being seized ecstatically and pulled. I did not move, but my body felt afterward like it had, expended. Perhaps the lineaments of my hard form blurred or doubled, posing a question to my concreteness that would allow an internal aspect to escape and return, shivering one me into more like the dying horizon. For in my memories there is a faint sight of the sky intercut by top-hats seen from below, from in the grave, in eternal repose. ,In terms of my experience of the vision, I remember only being at one moment in it and at another out, and, anyways, the relationship between these stations was only consequent, never temporal. My transition remains obscure. It brought me briefly into the ordinary, easy world, where my now two companions conversed. There, I had an intense, waking sensation of verticality with Yosef Michel, the same alignment suggested by our similar days. This alignment assumed a physical aspect in my foot-steps in his foot-steps, and in the foot-steps and sight-lines of those who buried him then. I suppose it was mainly a familial sensation. But I had also slotted myself into the ancient processes associated with this cemetery, the relating, the imagining, the searching, the finding—and then the difficult confrontation with the necessary questions of meaning and why. ,I then passed briefly into a second, more diaphanous vision, which I experienced as another layer superimposed on this basic one. Its genesis was a faint recollection of the photograph my father had sent me in anticipation of this visit: the photograph he took of the grave on his last visit, thirty-five years ago. It is a simple photograph, taken from a low and sidewound angle. A few small pebbles are scattered in traditional respect on the supine headstone, the bottom of which had already disappeared. A dark growth covers its stump; it still does in my time, though the edge is more jagged. The recesses of the inscription are sharp and legible, though this may have been the enhancement of black paint laid on by a worker or them. The simple image that came of this was of my father, younger—in fact, at my present age—standing beside my great-uncle, the namesake of Yosef Michel and brother of the grandfather with whom I share a birthday yet never encountered in this life. The two are nearly a single figure, so closely do I associate them in their care for this space. They are smiling.,Superimposed on my present, it appeared as though they stood among us. I shivered when I felt this, for in truth, it was out of respect for them, and not for my great-great-grandfather, that I had journeyed there. When, in order to honor their request for documentation, my friend photographed me standing beside the grave, the camera did not capture their presence, nor did it mark my distinct suspicion that my grandfather and my great-great-grandfather were also nearby. But it did capture my colorfully doubling figure and smile, which is the strongest possible evidence of their reality, some-odd vessel of my predecessors as I am: the burnt shade of hair, the cheekbones and grin. And it did capture and correctly frame the square plot of land on which I stood, where once stood my father, and grandfather, and great-grandfather, and on, and where may one day stand my own son or daughter. Certainly, the especial dirt of this earth is migratory, but as certainly it returns whenever we return. It is carried back and forth by the air. And so the air necessarily does the same. Thus, while I do not know about Holy Lands or this city of my dwelling, Jerusalem, I do know the truth of this small, familial sanctum. It is an emotional truth and an historical truth. Like the prior temenos, it has by the sanctity endowed it by burial lopped itself off from its physical surroundings. Like the temenos of now, it has established new, beautiful connections between persons. In it, the fact of kin is made real. The mountainous footpaths between generations are easily traversed.  And the possibility of connecting with ancestors who no longer wander and breathe but who retain within is made real, as is the possibility of encountering prior versions of loved ones as they once were. Then, in joy and not sorrow at loss, we can speak to one another in our own voices as our eternal selves and describe better paths for future journeys.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/mountain-olives/,"

"The mention of the word ‘cardboard box’ usually conjures up images of homeless people and newborn cats. It is thus no surprise that the idea of filling a box with wine makes wine connoisseurs shutter with disapproval. However, a simple cost-inebriation analysis would show that boxed wines solve all of our alcohol budget problems, without sacrificing class, taste, and style.,The “bag-in-box” (or ‘BiB’) innovation was first made as a way to transport battery acid. Thomas Angove, a southern Australian grape grower, was the first to market the BiB innovation as a container for wine (as a “cask”), and it has transformed the industry. Boxed wines came to U.S. supermarkets by the 1980s. Since then, it has been marketed by Target with sleek appearances and spiffy names like the ‘Wine Cube’ and ‘Black Box.’ The market is dominated by the more well-known (though lower quality) Franzia, which sells over 60 million boxes a year.,A typical box of wine carries three liters of wine, which is four bottles of wine. This means that one bottles’ worth of Franzia would cost just above $2.00, probably less than what you spend on a cup of coffee). Higher quality boxed wines, such as Black Box, sell for around $5 a bottle, while a bottle of the same quality would otherwise cost $12 (see figure). Now, even premium artisan wines from vineyards from New Zealand to California are being sold in “premium wine cask format” (which is a pretentious way to say ‘box’).,Being able to purchase a bottle of wine for a fraction of the price may sound too good to be true. With all of this cost efficiency, is wine quality compromised? Studies have shown that the plastic bag that contains the wine is not toxic, and doesn’t change the taste of the wine. In fact, two years ago, Wine Spectator , a top ranked lifestyle magazine, reviewed 39 premium, boxed wines, and 37 of them received a “good” score (above 80 points). ,The design of boxed wines also offer advantages; they are much easier to store, and last much longer once opened. Because of the design of the bag with a spout, air isn’t exposed when wine is released. This allows opened boxes of wine to remain fresh for three to four weeks (whereas opened bottles of white wine last just 2 days). In addition, boxed wine has a much smaller carbon footprint.,Boxed wine should feel natural to us; we’ve been drinking out of ‘Juicy Juice 100% Juice’ packs since before we could say the words ‘sauvignon blanc’ (except you probably still can’t say that correctly). In fact, other companies are embracing the “simple and easy” appeal of boxes for beverages such as iced tea and juices (see ‘Gregory’s Box’d Beverages’). A google search of  “boxed beverages” will find you just about any variety of drink but one: carbonated. One of the only functional reasons that bottles and cans are so ubiquitous is that they offer a more compressed vessel that allows soda, champagne and beers to stay carbonated for longer.,Perhaps the only reason that boxed wines aren’t more popular among more cultured audiences is because of a sense of obligation we have for the tradition. Glass bottles were originally used to store wine because they offered a way to store wine long-term for aging. Wine merchants began selling wine by the bottle rather than the barrel, because it was more economical. You may have noticed that wines of different varieties are sold in differently shaped bottles. These bottles shapes are actually thought out; for example, “Bordeaux” bottles—with short necks and high “shoulders—trap sediment when wine is being poured, while champagne bottles have a wider body, and are made of a thicker glass to handle pressure. There are actually entire blogs that have endless information about the different types and functions of the wine bottles we use. How can years of glasswork and craftsmanship be undermined by a folded piece of cardboard?,However, if boxed wines offer equivalent quality for better prices, why does it offend some critics? Isn’t all of the splendor of the elegance of glassware worth giving up for a spin on the ‘Tour de Franzia’? Or how about for a game of ‘slap the bag’? (in which you remove the plastic bag of wine and, quite literally, slap the bag to facilitate the release of the wine). The only potential disadvantage is that empty boxes of wine can’t be displayed on the windowsill of your dorm room to subtly remind visitors that you too are a cool college kid that consumes alcohol.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/wine-box/,"

"One of my primary goals on my family trip to China just before school started this year was to get some cool art for my room. Walking down the aisles of the antique market in Beijing, I had a feeling I was going to find what I was looking for. As I moved from shanty to shanty, taking in the different pieces of art while having prices screamed at me in gibberish, one piece caught my eye – this piece:  ,It had a sort of hypnotic effect on me. I didn’t know why I was so drawn to it, but as soon as I saw it, I knew I had to have it. I didn’t buy it right away, opting to check out all of my options first – but I kept coming back to it in my head. Questions began piling up: Why does the little girl have a knife? Why is the pig’s head in the air? Why the pink background? How did this standoff come to be? The overriding question however, as with most pieces of art, was what does it all mean?,Once I had the painting back in my hotel room, I sat down to examine it for a while. Eventually, I formed what I thought was the correct interpretation based on solid observations that I believed could explain the majority of the components in front of me. This had to be what the artist intended. But when I took this interpretation to my Mom, she told me I was wrong. She had her own opinion that she believed to be the definitive answer.,Now there were two people in my family with entirely different interpretations that they strongly believed in, but we couldn’t both be right.  When we went to my Dad for the tie breaker, he offered a third, distinctive interpretation of the painting, throwing everyone into a tizzy.,This painting has been hanging in my Princeton dorm room for approximately three weeks. Each time a new visitor has come to the room, I have asked them to analyze the painting. Amazingly, everyone has offered up a unique opinion – some more unique than others, but all special in their own way.,The following is a list of interpretations of what I now call the “Pig Girl” painting, that I have compiled to share with all of you.,_My interpretation (I’ll let you insert your own parenthetical for me):_ The pig stands for corruption and greed. The little girl represents innocence. She is trying to stave off the corruption of her innocence, but the whole thing is a paradox because by killing it, it is clear that the pig has won and her innocence has been lost already.,_My Mom (same goes for her):_ Being that the painting is from China, the pig represents Communism and the little girl is an oppressed Chinese girl trying to rise up against the government.,_My Dad (and him):_ The little girl just killed a person. The dead body is lying right behind her and the pig is the only witness. She is deciding whether or not to kill the pig to cover her tracks.,_Freshman Male (concerned about America’s standing in the world):_ The pig stands for how the rest of the world perceives America. The girl represents Asia (China in particular) trying to supplant the US as the most influential world power.,_Sophomore Male (also pessimistic about the direction we are heading):_ It represents the industrialization of society. We are turning on nature but we have no choice.,_Sophomore Male (a carnivore):_ It’s an arrogant pompous pig that deserves to die.,_Sophomore Female (who should probably get to know the above carnivore):_ The little girl hates pigs. This is the last scene in her pig genocide. She has killed every pig and this is the last one left.,_Sophomore Male (putting his own dreams aside to follow in his father’s footsteps):_ The little girl’s family is starving. It is her favorite pig but she has to kill it to save the family.,_Sophomore Male (following his own dreams against his father’s will) :_ The little girl just stopped her family from slaughtering the pig. She took the knife away from her family. The pig is bowing in thanks.,_Sophomore Female (potentially on the road to an eating disorder):_ The pig stands for bacon/hamburgers (food in general). The little girl represents being skinny. She is trying to fight off the food to stay skinny.,_Sophomore Female (and a frequent victim of aggressive creeping on the street):_ The pig is the one on the attack. The girl is just trying to defend herself, but the pig is going to kill her.,_Sophomore Male (with an overbearing older sibling):_ The painting is not complete. Behind the little girl stands her older sister, telling her what to do.  The pig is looking up at the big sister while the little sister kills it.,_Sophomore Female (with a very “special” way of looking at things):_ It’s like a combination of Charlotte’s Web and Up!,_Sophomore Male (who thinks pigs understand the concept of compensation):_ The pig and the girl are paid actors preparing to perform the final scene of their blockbuster film, in which they duel to the death; they stand against a green screen.,_Sophomore Male (and a Youtube subscriber of EpicMealTime):_ The pig is a huge fan of EpicMealTime and he has asked the little girl to slaughter him so that he may one day be used as an ingredient on the show. The girl is skeptical, but the pig knows what he wants, and he won’t take no for an answer. #baconstrips,_Sophomore Male (who knows that in real life there isn’t always a happy ending):_ The pig used to be a little boy. He was the little girl’s boyfriend. An evil fairy turned him into a pig and there is no way to change him back. He has asked the girl to kill him to end his embarrassment and put him out of his misery.,_Sophomore Female (and O.J. Simpson admirer):_ The pig is the little girl’s boyfriend. He cheated on her so she sees him as a pig. She is going to stab him as revenge for his infidelity.,_Sophomore Male (afraid of the dentist):_ The little girl is an aspiring veterinarian. The pig has a toothache and she wants to help. The pig is bracing itself for the pain of having its tooth pried out with the knife.,_Sophomore Male (upset about the NBA lockout):_ The pig is David Stern and the Little Girl is a huge basketball fan.,_Junior Male (and a fraternity member):_ The pig represents frats. The little girl is Shirley Tilghman because she looks innocent on the surface but underneath that cool exterior lies an even colder bitch.,_Junior Male (bitter about the lies his parents fed him as a child):_ The girl was told to slaughter the pig, but she loves it very much. She wants it to go out as peacefully as possible, so she told him that they were going to play a game, and that he should close his eyes and count to 10. Now she’s wrestling with her emotions as she prepares to knife him.,_Junior Male (either afraid of women’s rights or just grappling with his sexuality):_ The girl is a lesbian warrior on a mission to eliminate all sausage.,This list is just a sample of the ways I have heard this painting analyzed. Through this little experiment, I have come to realize that “what the artist intended” may not be the most important part of a piece of art. And it is not the lens through which we should attempt to experience art. As an artist, you create something that has a personal connection to you, but with the knowledge that nobody can have the exact same perspective on it as you do. Once the work is created, your job is done and the rest is up to your audience.,There may be certain messages or themes that are universally communicated through a piece, but each audience member picks up on a slightly different set of details and nuances within that piece. Nuances that you, as the artist, perhaps did not even intend. In any artistic medium, meaning takes on a new form in each person’s personal connection with what they see, hear, feel or even what they smell, taste, or experience with a magical sixth sense that nobody else has.,Some of the above “Pig Girl” interpretations may resonate with you and others (probably most) may seem ridiculous. But all of them reflect something true about their author’s way of thinking and about the subjective nature of art. After hearing so many different interpretations of this single painting, I still think that my interpretation is right; but that doesn’t mean I think that any of the other ones are wrong. My view is just right for me.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/girl-meets-pig/,"

      Sep 28, 2011    ",Will Pinke
"I think it was sometime in late September when my roommate (Tom Kelly—he’ll come into play later) pointed out that one could make friends on the Integrated Course Engine. I was intrigued, and sent out a few furtive requests to some hallmates. Before I knew it I had twenty friends, then thirty, then forty. Many people told me that I was their only ICE friend, and I had more than anyone I knew. I had more than Tom, and we turned it into a friendly competition. ,But even when the novelty wore off I requested more people; I was legitimately fascinated by the academic interests of the people I knew. More than any other tool, even conversation, ICE told me about the intellectual pursuits of my friends—the classes they took, the ones they wanted to take, the ones they were debating between. ,I still have this curiosity, and remain entranced by the potential of ICE. But at some point my innocent endeavor was hijacked by the sultry scent of glory. I wanted to have a lot of ICE friends, but that wasn’t enough. I wanted to have the most ICE friends. I didn’t give it much thought, but in the back of my mind, as I reached fifty, as I surpassed sixty, I assumed this would be easy—that no one else would have nearly this many. Why would they? It’s a silly goal. But it felt good to think that, even at Princeton, I could be the best at something.,When the fall 2012 courses went up, I gleefully took to ICE, eager to work out a schedule for myself (and to spy on the choices of others). But all this joyful energy came crashing down with a simple text from Tom: “Will Harrel has more friends than you!” What?! How?! Why?! Whywould anyone have more than sixty-five friends? I frantically refreshed ICE, and there it was, plain as day, on the right hand side of the page: “A quick update on our ICE social network: Will Harrel ’13 is in the lead with the most number of friends!”,I’d never met Will, but I messaged him on Facebook, asking just how many friends it took to be in the lead. At the time, he had 71 friends. Tom and I requested him (and were accepted), knowing it would not help the friend differential but unable to resist. Through sheer force of will, I raised my total to eighty-four. Convinced that I had finally gained the title, I set up an interview with Harrel himself. Ostensibly, it was for this article. But in reality, I just wanted to see his face when he discovered his throne had been usurped.,DM: So, how long have you been collecting ICE friends?,WH: I started in my freshman year. ICE was originally a COS 333 project. Gyeong-Sik Choi [class of 2010] turned it into an app that everyone could use. The friend feature came the summer before sophomore year. ,DM: Before we keep going, I want our readers to get to know you a little better. Let me ask a few random questions about you. To begin, what is your favorite rapper named after a popular but generic ice cream flavor?,WH: Vanilla Ice.,DM: What is your favorite song by him?,WH: “Ice, Ice Baby.”,DM: What is your favorite phase of matter for H2O to be in? ,WH, more confidently: Ice.,(I’ll admit his answer shocked me. Given liquid water’s necessity for life, I thought that would be the easy answer. But apparently Will cares more about seeing schedules than existing.),DM: Really, more than liquid? ,WH: Ice is more versatile. It can be a drink or a course engine.,(At the time, I was impressed with his quick wit, but further reflection has shown that this response made no freaking sense. I decided to narrow in.),DM: To the point, have you met all of your ICE friends outside of ICE?,WH: Yes. I consider ICE friends to be more of a close group than Facebook friends.,(This blatant lie provided me with an opening for my first strike.),DM: Does the name Thomas Kelly mean anything to you? ,WH: Yes, he friended me on ICE. I only friend request people that I know. I generally accept all requests,though, and I’ve gotten two or three people to request me that I didn’t know.,(Oh, so ever since his name went up in lights he’s been unable to fend off all of his fans.),DM: What is the creepiest thing you’ve ever done using your knowledge from ICE? ,WH: I am currently in Manna Assassins, and I’ve used it to find out what classes people were in. A lot of people come up to me and ask me to show them my friends’ schedules so they can assassinate them.,DM: Have you considered changing your schedule to confuse your assassin? ,WH: I don’t want to disclose that until the end of the game. But my assassin is welcome to try and go to the classes that are on my ICE and see if I’m there.,(That’s all pretty creepy, but I’m not going to lie: I admire his dedication.),DM: Did you know that ICE was going to put your name on the website? ,WH: Yes. Gyeong-Sik was visiting Princeton for the week and courses had just come out. He was using my computer to update ICE, and I told him how many friends I had. We decided to check and see who had the most friends, and it was me.,DM: Was it ever a goal to have the most friends? ,WH: It was not a goal, but I always liked to see people’s schedules.,(It was totally a goal.),DM: Does it feel like a competition now that it says that you are “in the lead?” Is there a target on your back? ,WH: No, not really. If this helps grow ICE’s social network and the number of friends people have, I think that would be great.,(He seemed pretty genuine here, but it was time to test him, to find out what song he’d sing from second place.),DM: How many friends do you have currently?,WH: I just got over 100. I think 103.,(My stomach dropped. 103?! The guy’s in a whole different league! I really I thought I could do it; this was a surprise.),DM: Wow, I am impressed. I’m at eighty-four and I thought that was impressive. How do you get so many friends?,WH: Well, I’ve been here for three years, and I’ve known a lot of friends, and some of my friends have graduated, so not all of the 103 are active students.,DM: If you could add one thing to ICE, what would it be? ,WH: I can’t think of anything right now. I’ve talked to Gyeong-Sik a lot about this. He added the networking thing, and we changed colors about a year and a half ago. There are a few bugs that he is working on, with classes that start at weird times. I did suggest the different colors to him. ,(I spent the above answer planning a last, desperate gamble. I would get what I came for.),DM: I have a roommate with over one hundred friends now, too. I think he’s at 111. I’m sorry to tell you, Will, you’re no longer in the lead. If you could just walk me through your emotions right now—,WH: I think it’s fantastic to see ICE growing. Many things are more important in life than who has the most ICE friends. It’s a cool record to have, but there are dozens of things that I would rather have than the most number of ICE friends. ,DM: Well, it turns out that I made that last part up; you’re still in the lead. Congrats.,WH: Oh.,The most painful part of that interview wasn’t discovering that he was in the lead. It was his reaction at the end; there was pain on his face, but more than anything he was sincere in his love of ICE. I had that once, but where had it gone? When had my appreciation for a genuinely useful tool turned into something so selfish? And for that matter, what had I hoped to accomplish with that interview? Did I see myself as some next-generation Stephen Colbert, poised to “nail” Harrel with tough questions and rig the game to my favor? Why couldn’t I just be happy for him?,It took some time, but today I am happy for Will. I still like having friends (I’m up to ninety), but it’s not the end of the world that I’m not the leader. Besides, isn’t that why I came to Princeton? In high school, it’s easy to be the best at something; the pool is smaller, the standards aren’t as high. But I came to Princeton so that I could fail. I came here so that people would be better than me, so that I’d always have a higher mark to strive for. ,And maybe when I’m a junior I’ll have as many friends as Will Harrel does (I’m certainly on track), but that doesn’t mean anything now. The old me, the petty me, would have clung to the idea that Will was friends with graduates, that Will had an extra year to make friends. I would have concluded that even if Will was “ahead,” I was still “better” at it. But really, who gives a rat’s ass. Will Harrel is a stand-up fellow who happens to have a lot of ICE friends. I’m just a guy who also has a lot of ICE friends. It’s not always about being the best, and sometimes, it’s just about winning a game of Assassins.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/ice-meet-you-frosh/,"

      Sep 8, 2012    ",Dayton Martindale
"A few years ago, the artsy and presumably transity Peter B. Lewis threw enough money at the University to roughly eclipse Rick Ross’ monthly champagne budget. Rather than being used to purchase “magnum bottles of that Rosé,” the money will be allocated to expanding the Lewis Center for the Arts. The Center, which is mostly located in a mostly un-airconditioned former elementary school, offers certificate programs in creative writing, dance, theater, and visual arts. The University plans to expand these programs by building an Arts & Transit Neighborhood off University Place and moving the Dinky station south by 460 feet. The tracks between the new and old stations will be removed, allowing students to walk directly between Whitman and Forbes without having to go around them. The existing station would become a café and the new station would share a roof with a relocated Wawa. This would also help create a more contiguous campus by connecting the otherwise neglected Forbes College with virtually everything else.,Though the proposal may seem innocent on the surface, some people say the neighborhood has the potential to destroy the 250 thread count fabric of Princetonian society. Save the Dinky, a non-profit organization suing the University, claims that the proposed plan will decrease accessibility, marginalize the historic qualities of the Dinky, and is straight up illegal. I will examine their claims in that order.,The organization claims that with increased distance comes decreased accessibility. Due to the fact that there is a slight grade difference between the existing and proposed termini, Save the Dinky states that the neighborhood’s topography will make the station inaccessible to the physically disabled. Of course, the Americans with Disabilities Act deals with this, and plans have included a number of wheelchair accessible paths to the station. That said, Save the Dinky’s FAQ states that “pedestrians headed north will have to go up the stairs or ramp.”  Also, the University may be underreporting the distance the Dinky platform is moved. After estimating the distance with world-renowned measuring tool, Google Maps, Save the Dinky discovered that the Dinky may be moved 480 feet: based on an average stride length of 2.35 feet per stride, this 20 foot discrepancy adds up to roughly 10 additional steps per trip. I can only imagine how my flabby thighs and calves will soon become supple with the strain of walking atop glorious inclined ramps. ,Returning to the issue at hand, STD cites a study that states that pedestrians are more likely to walk to and use public transportation if the station lies within 1/2 mile of a population center, which is apparently Nassau Street. For the moment, I will disregard most of the facts at hand. I will pretend that Nassau is not a commercial, but residential center. I will ignore the fact that the Dinky is the 43rd most trafficked NJTransit station (out of about 150) and is in no danger of being shut down. I will also turn a blind eye to the fact that the station is moving less than 1/11th of a mile. Also, I will assume that nobody lives on the southern side of the Dinky station, which is patently false. I will assume that the move would only benefit residents of Forbes College, and that we simply can’t hear them from this zip code. The only fair and balanced conclusion I can draw is that the Dinky is in grave danger because of the proposed move.,In its next point, Save the Dinky deviates from its primary platform and states that the Wa will also be jeopardized. Wawa is already farther from most of campus than Lindsay Lohan is from sobriety. As the only all-night food market in Princeton, Wawa has a monopoly on late night food and can frankly do whatever it wants—within reason—and get away with it. When I’m sloshed and have no concept of distance or need to eat at 4 a.m., a few hundred extra feet is not going make a difference; those sloppy Wawa hoagies are my Saturday night hook-up. Additionally, because residents of south campus no longer have to go around the Dinky tracks, the new location will be actually be closer for some.,Some background on the issue is needed to fully understand the issue of marginalizing history that Save the Dinky brings up. The Princeton Station was initially chartered in 1865 in the area that now lies between the Junior slums and Blair Arch. In 1918, the University moved the station southward by roughly 1700 feet and built the existing station and freight house buildings. Since 1984, the station has been recognized by the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on account of its architectural significance—especially its distinctive high-level platform. The Dinky is also significant as one of the last remaining shuttle lines. ,Though turning a historic train station into an upscale café is a bastardization of the building’s historical significance, we do not have to look further than Old Nassau to see that historic buildings do not have to be used for their original purpose. Nassau Hall is an administrative building and no longer houses academic programs and dormitories. The “Witherspoon Street School for Colored People,” as it is called in the historic register, is now a nursing home. That said, the platform is historic is and cannot simply be ripped up. The University will probably have to work around this unless a court blatantly ignores the 1984 designation.,That contract was not the only significant document worked out in 1984. The same year, the University purchased the surrounding land and the station from NJ Transit with a number of conditions. Though the land legally belongs to the University, NJ Transit operates the shuttle train and maintains a public easement over the entirety of the purchased land for public transportation purposes. As a result, the station and its parking lot are, to a degree, public land and must be used for public transportation. The public easement expires 5 years after it is no longer used for public transportation purposes, so for Princeton to build the Arts & Transit neighborhood on the existing easement, the station must be moved. This is Save The Dinky’s core objection: that the University wants to move the Dinky in order to make the easement expire. ,With the Arts & Transit Neighborhood, the University is proposing to again move the Dinky’s terminus southward. The legal debate revolves around whether the 1984 contract stipulates that the terminus can be moved only once or multiple times. NJ Transit has expressed support for the terminus move and stated that the University has the “right to move the terminus of the rail line southward so long as NJ Transit’s reservation of rights for a 170 foot platform is preserved.” Though a court could theoretically rule in favor of Save the Dinky, it’s unlikely because both parties to the contract are interpreting the contract in the same way. Save the Dinky has already justified a potential loss in court, indignantly broadcasting that Governor Chris Christie is a member of the University’s board of trustees and a sweetheart deal could be in the works. That said, every state governor has been an ex officio Trustee. Even if Save the Dinky wins such a lawsuit, the University and NJ Transit can simply amend the 1984 contract to work around the court decision.,It’s a pity that Save the Dinky’s publicly available information largely focuses on its inane and frivolous complaints about accessibility. Though STD’s other arguments—about history, especially—are valid, we can recall at least one thing from the haze of orientation week: nothing ever happens in Princeton. So if we ever really have a problem, we’ll throw Peter B. Lewis’ money at it ‘til it disappears beneath the shiny new pathways, reflecting pond, and upscale café of a growing orange bubble.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/s-d-frosh/,"

"It all begins with the fourteen page Panhellenic Recruitment handbook that arrives in your inbox shortly after registration, a process in which some very enthusiastic girls in the basement of Dod take a picture two inches away from your face. The packet outlines the schedule of the coming week, which, you will notice with some alarm, contains twelve hours of rush activities. It has a fun vocabulary section, which is super helpful because I didn’t actually know what the word philanthropy meant before rush. Thanks Panhellenic! It also contains a lot of slightly militaristic sounding abbreviations (PNMs must report to their Rho Chis in order to Pref, apparently), which I think is supposed to keep us confused and therefore easy to direct around.,Every night on the Woody Woo plaza groups are formed, and the girls of each group line up in alphabetical order. This usually consists of a something vaguely reminiscent of the script you have to sign in at the end of the SAT: simple in theory, but an extraordinary struggle in practice.  ,The alphabetization turns out to be very important, however, because it determines what girl you are paired with when you first enter the party in a single file line (she grabs your arm in a vice-like grip) and this girl has to remember you so that she can rate you on how well you can answer the following five questions: Where are you from? Where do you live? What classes are you taking? What are you interested in doing on campus? How do you like Princeton so far? Also, whether you’re pretty.  ,Kappa Kappa Gamma opens with a chant that consists of something like: I’m a Kappa Kappa Gamma / bet your life I am a / girl who’s proud to wear the golden key, repeated a thousand times. This doesn’t seem like something I’m particularly eager to bet my life on, but okay, Kappa. Do you. Going into the whole thing, I was unaware of parties’ emphasis on costumes, which seems like the product of tremendous thought but is then never discussed. It doesn’t seem to enhance the conversations; in fact, talking to fifty girls dressed as Greek goddesses or baseball players is a little distracting. On the first night, the Kappas are dressed as cops, or sheriffs, or something. Something with braids. Pi Phi is free love themed. Apparently combating the chapter stereotypes is not one of their main priorities. Theta is nautical themed, which is cruel because the snacks are especially appealing—Swedish fish and goldfish. This brings me to one of the terrible quandaries of rush: at every party, the girl with the death grip on your arm asks if you want something to eat. If you say yes, she will promptly ask you a hundred questions while your mouth is full so that you are forced to awkwardly speak with your hand in front of your mouth or else spit tiny bits of goldfish in her face. Say no to the snacks.,Pi Phi seemed very intent on showing off their spelling abilities with their chant, which, as someone who watches the Scripps National Spelling Bee religiously after falling in love with winner Sameer Mishra way back in 2008 (he misheard the word numnah as numb nut—comedy gold), I can appreciate. But easily the worst part of the whole process is how catchy the chants are. I found myself walking home humming and softly chanting me for pi for beta phi for I just love pi beta phi which, beyond being very grammatically confusing, also gave me the vague sensation of being brainwashed. I guess this is a good experience to have in case I’m ever kidnapped while backpacking in a remote foreign country or something similar.  It could happen.,At some of the parties, the girls hand out fun party favors like sunglasses and necklaces. However, because of Panhellenic regulations forbidding the exchange of gifts during the rush process, these presents will be unceremoniously yanked out of your hands on the way out. This results in some ridiculous situations in the case of food: on numerous occasions I saw mini cinnamon buns and brownie bites snatched out of girls hands by slightly overzealous sisters.  Rules are rules.,The later nights are invitational, so if you’re asked back, you know you did a really good job describing your classes (or you’re just pretty—probably this).  Some girls don’t get asked back anywhere and, in a few cases, cry in public. Older girls respond with a quasi-sympathetic smile that seems to say, sucks to suck.,By the second or third night, I’m starting to have frat envy.  Chugging a gallon of milk and running a few miles, or dressing up as a used tampon for Halloween (SAE, I’m looking at you), seems almost desirable compared to this marathon of girl flirting.  Adding insult to injury is Panhellenic’s insistence on calling the sororities “women’s fraternities.”  ,On Preference Night, things get serious. Thetas are in all black and make speeches about all the things they hate about each other in order to cutely prove that they love each other, but mostly just seem like they hate each other. The Pi Phis are wearing all white and singing a very creepy high-pitched song about how they are “calling us now to be one in Pi Phi.” I’m not drinking the Kool Aid.  And then it’s time to list our preferences.  We are forbidden from talking to each other and made to sit with one seat between each of us while we make our decision, which we are told should only be about us and not our friends—which kind of counterintuitive considering we’re talking about a social organization.  ,The next day there’s a huge, hour-long line of girls snaking down the stairs in Witherspoon, waiting to venture one at a time into a room at the end of the hallway and be presented with a bid in a sealed envelope.  One girl heads down the stairs apparently empty handed and is swarmed by the line.  ,“What happened?” asks the crowd. “Theta?”  ,“Um,” says the girl. “I just live here.”,Right about now, that sounds pretty good to me.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/making-friends-frosh/,"

"My first reaction was an unsettled, “What the heck?” Followed by a pissed, “Wow, way over the line.” Finally settling on, “Crap—now what?” From the back cover of the Nass, the Hebrew name of God, the holy Tetragrammaton, was staring up at me with the menacing grin of a camper who just got away with stealing food from the kitchen. From our rather unholy publication, in an article titled “Kanye West’s Top 20 Baby Names,” I saw the letters referred to as the Unutterable Name, the Distinctive Name, the Ineffable Name. Sorry, my bad. I meant: the Unutterable Name (except by the Nass), the Distinctive Name (except by the Nass), and the Ineffable Name (except by the gosh-damn Nassau Weekly).,The sanctity of God’s name is not merely a Jewish concept, evidenced clearly by my use of “gosh” above as a replacement for “God.” Throughout history, the holiness of this combination of letters—which I will henceforth designate by the transliteration YHWH—has informed two primary categories of prohibitions: that of speaking the name aloud and that of discarding it once written. Put simply, no Jew is permitted to pronounce the letters YHWH and its cameo in the Nass means we—which will henceforth designate the Jewish community—are prohibited from desecrating God’s name by throwing those editions out.,As it happens (ie. a more casual attribution to divine providence), my breakfast date with Rabbi David Wolkenfeld, the Center for Jewish Life’s Orthodox rabbi, to discuss this issue is interrupted by two prominent visitors to a Judaic Studies conference. In between bites of his toasted bagel, Rabbi Wolkenfeld explains our predicament to Professor Martin Lockshin, Chair of the Department of the Humanities, York University, Toronto, North America. Yes, YHWH. Yes, in Hebrew letters. Professor Lockshin, entirely unassuming in his navy suit-pants and matching flap cap, laughs with years of experience echoing hardily. “A fascinating question,” he remarks with a slight air of been-there-done-that. “Classic campus shayla.” (“Shayla” is the pseudo-Hebrew-Aramaic word religious people use instead of ‘question’ when referring specifically to a challenging law-related predicament.),He hit the nail right on the head. This problem embodies the tension created by stuffing religion into the intellectually suffocating box of college. Wait, you say, isn’t a University the epitome of intellectual openness, the paradigm of all academic pursuits? Specifically and exclusively academic, yes. But a religious lifestyle cannot be wholly academic; the leap of faith and fear/love of God that is a prerequisite to a religiously oriented life is checked at the door of any university’s Department of Religion. (Why do you think Princeton has an Office of Religious Life separate from its Department of Religion?) College is the period in which students are routinely exposed to faith-busting courses on the human origins of the Bible, subjecting religious text to the same academic rigor applied to every other discipline. The , desecration of God’s name merely reflects the wholesale secularization of religion that embodies the heart of academia and destroys the soul of faith. A classic campus shayla.,For anyone attuned to it, this discourse materializes all over the place. At least all over certain places. It’s present in that awkward moment when, in a speech to the Jewish community, a student slips and mentions the “authors” of the Hebrew Bible. It’s the awkward moment in JDS 306: Elementary Biblical Hebrew when a non-Jewish student asks how to pronounce YHWH. Or the awkward moment when a Jewish student stutters reading a verse that includes one of 6,828 times the Tetragrammaton is printed in the Hebrew Bible because he or she is caught between a religious tenant and the academic textbook.,This communal discomfort with The Name is rooted farther back in childhood than most realize. Being in JDS 306 is a throwback to the first-grade teasing and perspective-less (the law clearly indicates a spectrum of severity for certain prohibitions, a fact some religious communities tend to lose perspective of) hyper-stringency that still characterizes some ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. YHWH presents a unique challenge to all initially learning to read Hebrew, especially the liturgical services. And especially six-year-olds. Can we expect those hardly able to perform basic arithmetic to understand the concept of holiness being integral to a name? It suffices for teachers to simply lay the following ground rules: (1) Never pronounce YHWH; (2) If you are praying or reading aloud from the Torah, say “Adonai” (Translated as ‘Lord’); (3) If you are speaking about God colloquially, the accepted ‘less holy’ version is “HaShem” (Literally, ‘the Name’). So when first-graders read Hebrew aloud in class and one poor child accidentally chants Adonai instead of HaShem, his friends snap at the opportunity to exhibit both their intelligence and piety: “Ah! He said Adonai!”,“No, no,” the teacher explains, “if it’s for educational purposes, it’s fine to say Adonai.” “Oh,” they sigh as they sit back into their seats.,Or does this awkward shifting in our chairs when confronted directly with God’s name reflect a much deeper issue? Are we, as a religious community, simply uncomfortable talking about God in the first place? It’s not outrageous to think, perhaps, that being so engulfed in a community focused exclusively on academia makes it embarrassing to acknowledge a force that is extra-academic. In a culture addicted to the façade of being in control, does acknowledging our humanity and dependence on a Higher Power admit too much weakness and vulnerability? Are we so angry because Kanye, in his freedom to possibly name his stupid baby YHWH, can do something we never could: be mindless, be completely objective, be detached from and disinterested in this embarrassing, annoying, and inconvenient sacredness?,Regardless of the reason, Jews still exhibit a collective sensitivity and anxiety when confronted with the name YHWH. Our obsession with the Tetragrammaton (which, by the way, means ‘four letter word’ in Greek; one of the only holy four letter words out there… besides ‘holy’ I guess.) hearkens back, not only to our personal childhood memory, but also to our historical communal memory. At one point in time, most scholars agree, the Name was actually pronounced as a greeting. By the Second Temple period, YHWH was pronounced only by the High Priest in the Temple on the holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur. By the first centuries of the Common Era, the foundational text of Jewish law, the Mishna, asserts that those who pronounce YHWH will lose their share in the world to come.,Apparently then, the ,staff should enjoy this world while they still can. Now that the papers have already been printed and distributed, only a few options remain: (1) Crusade through the night, burning down Bloomberg and The Packet (printer of the Nass) with unforgiving vengeance; (2) Drink dangerous quantities of alcohol, obsessively circle campus collecting every copy, throw them all in the garbage, and wake up the next morning to find the problem solved, but thankfully have no recollection whatsoever of the previous night’s escapade; (3) Employ a rescue squad to locate and seize all extant copies of that issue, discarding them into the CJL’s bin designated for such holy papers (called a “genizah box”) until their eventual ritual burial; (4) Turn a blind eye (the other cheek, if you will) and pretend like nothing happened.,With these in mind, Rabbi Wolkenfeld and I discuss his deliberations with his own rabbis. Rabbi Dov Linzer, the head of Rabbi Wolkenfeld’s rabbinical school, inclined towards more stringent methods and intimated the responsibility of Jews on campus to collect and discard the copies in the genizah accordingly, while understanding that stealing a stack of 25 Nassau Weeklies from the Forbes lobby is ridiculous. Rabbi Yaacov Love, chair of the Department of Jewish Law at the same institution, tended towards a more lenient approach, arguing that the printed name is merely referring to a baby in a secular context and not infused with the religious significance of God’s name. Therefore, we are permitted to recycle them, a more dignified option than discarding them in the nauseating garbage soup that will disintegrate the paper in the trash. Some opinions even hold that all photocopies of YHWH, which are clearly intended to be more temporary than a printed book, can/should always be recycled.,This distinction highlights the ever-changing relationship of the Jewish people to our sacred texts. At one time, books were rare, copied manually through painstaking, laborious hours; a scribe sitting with a quill and ink, physically engraving holiness into the parchment with undivided attention. The scribe’s life work was defined by imbuing meaning into text, establishing holiness where it had previously not existed and fulfilling the commandment to bring God’s Name into the world. The “People of the Book” throughout history have decorated their houses with bookshelves and recognized the completion of books with communal celebrations (that even have the power to nullify certain ritual fast days). Now we make photocopies of that same material daily, but does the source sheet used for a 45-minute class retain the same sanctity as the handwritten? For the ability to quickly and effectively spread information, we have, in some sense, traded our reverence for those texts. We have traded the awe inspired by opening up the manually inscribed Word of God, making it all the more important for us to retain that reverence at least for God’s name. (N.B. Torah scrolls are still written entirely by hand on many pieces of parchment, cost tens of thousands of dollars, and must adhere to the strictest standards of exact reproduction—any mistake in the text, even an illegible half of a letter or the slightest variation from the source text, renders the entire scroll unkosher for use. This both reflects and causes the strong awareness of and obsession with tradition that the Jewish people have maintained throughout history.),My gut reaction to seeing YHWH in such an unholy context comes from our compulsive communal need to preserve the sanctity of our tradition. We are terrified even of the tiny cracks in our towering walls that scream: “This is my God and I will always defend His name.” It’s not necessarily a bad reaction—it keeps us vigilant, respectful, ever-reverent of a Higher Power. On the other hand, college is the time to push the boundaries of our comfort zone and maybe the , slip-up presents us with a unique opportunity. Our other guest at breakfast, Professor Marc Hirschman from Hebrew University in Jerusalem, joked about some vandal who keyed YHWH into a bathroom stall door: “No one knew what to do about it or how to remove it. But we had to do something. Writing God’s name in the bathroom was just causing an uncontrollable plague of mass constipation.” Maybe once in a while, there’s also room to laugh at ourselves, even just a little.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the-name-of-god/,"

"Hannah Horvath and I have a lot in common. We write, we’re white, our parents are academics, and we’re damn good at Tweeting. We’re also both insecure, in the kind of way that we hate talking about it with our actual voices but love talking about it with our self-deprecating writer’s voices. Like Hannah, I put on a brave front and most of the time seal my neuroses behind a witty and charming exterior, but like Hannah, I get weird when they leak out. In Hannah’s awkward, fumbling pseudo-victories over her personal cabal of anxieties, I have found not only a character I can connect with, but one I can look up to: a version of modern womanhood that seems genuine.,This summer, Anne Marie Slaughter wrote a piece about—say it with me—women and having it all. The piece itself calls attention to a lot of issues in the construction of American society, but the central premise, as many have pointed out, is flawed: whether male or female, no one can “have it all.” The struggle to “have” (as if it is possible to own) “it” (as if “it” is a singular state of being that can be reached in its entirety) “all”  (as if that somehow makes whatever “it” is more specific) is the struggle behind most literature, wars, debates, political careers, and reality television stints: no one’s figured it out. ,However unrealistic, the idea persists, and maybe what we mean isn’t “having it all” but “being happy,” which is confusing to us and has been for millennia, so we go for what we think being happy means. If you go by Anne Marie Slaughter’s definition, it means a successful career and perfect family life, even though judging by her decision to leave the State Department, she understands that her personal happiness is created by spending time with her family. I don’t think this is a gendered decision at all—I think most people would truly be happier if they could let go of their ambition and find a comfortable lifestyle that enabled them to spend most of their time with the people they love most. ,But as for me, right now, I don’t want to spend time with my children. I don’t want children. I don’t want a husband. My version of having it all would be a passion that pays well, a loving boyfriend, badass friends, a great wardrobe, and a killer bod. And what speaks more directly to my struggle to have it all as an almost-twenty-year-old is Girls. ,Hannah Horvath, like me, wants it all. She wants to live in New York; be “the voice of her generation, or at least a voice of a generation;” date weird, artistic guys; have weird, artistic sex; be very droll with her friends, and take some drugs. Maybe, in a more distilled reading, her struggle is the archetypal struggle of the “modern woman” in the most technical definition of the term: the woman who, currently, in this moment of time that is now happening, is becoming herself. The woman whose expensive liberal arts education came as a matter of course, who was raised without having to fight for anything besides her own self-esteem, whose neuroses are charming and not debilitating, and who understands the value of being both smart and attractive.,As watchers of the show know, Hannah’s not doing so well with her agenda, but it’s the first season and I’ll give her some time. What she is doing well, though, is manifesting the struggle to achieve the post-adolescent version of having it all, of which I too am poised on the cusp. I don’t want to be rich when I grow up, but I do want to be rich enough that I can eat sushi and drink cocktails and afford an iPhone. I would like to live in a big city and not with my parents, I would like to take taxis to really cool parties, I would like to have health insurance and biodegradable tote bags. And I want to look good. Really, really good. I want to be thin, but in a way that shows I can afford a gym membership, and stylish in a way that shows I’m classy, cool, and blessed with regular access to a shower. ,More than all of that, however, I want to be a person I want to be, so I want to write; ideally poetry but I’ll take what I can get, and I want to be dating interesting and attractive and intelligent men, so I have to be the kind of girl interesting and attractive and intelligent men want to date, which—I am just beginning to realize—means I have to be interesting and attractive and intelligent. I think this is the core of what I think having it all is. I also think that if I ever think I am the aforementioned things, I will have become exactly the type of girl only intolerable men want to date. ,Perhaps the most important thing Girls does for me is show how a funny, smart girl can get by—and be happy—without having it all. Hannah is not rich and she’s not the kind of pretty that MTV has made me think I should be. She doesn’t have a job, her boyfriend is simultaneously adorable and terrifying, and the four main female characters aren’t even all friends the way that Sex and the City has taught us to be, connected by shoes and sex. ,On some level, this is a TV show, and perhaps not the most legitimate of responses to Slaughter’s more intellectual argument. On another level, it is a show that has tried, in Dunham’s own words, to be “super-specific to [her] experience” of what it is to be—as the title suggests—a girl. If Hannah Horvath is the modern woman I will be in three or four years, she is the opposite of what Slaughter writes about. Hannah Horvath doesn’t have it all, but the more I watch her the more I realize she doesn’t really want to. Maybe my post-post-post women’s liberation generation no longer needs to prove our selves to be equal to men, maybe—like Hannah shouts in an episode—it’s okay if we just want to wear cute dresses and go to the movies, and maybe it’s okay if we quit unfulfilling jobs that make us unhappy and date boys our friends think are strange. If having it all is about finding a way to a unique and personalized happiness—not Slaughter’s definition of material success and a societally-condoned personal life, and not my definition culled from years of reading women’s magazines and watching Sex and the City—then I think Hannah has it right. And I think that, as a generation raised free of most of the injustices and slights our mothers and grandmothers had to fight, a generation fed on more nuanced ideas of what equality is, what sexism is, and what success is, us girls might turn out fine.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/girls-just-wanna-have-it-all/,"

"Well played, Nick. Well played. In what I felt was the most shocking finale in , history, Nick Peterson walked away with a quarter of a million dollars by betraying his partner, Rachel Truehart, in a high-stakes version of the prisoner’s dilemma. As the last two contestants in the competition, the two headed into deliberation rooms to decide between two options: keep and share. If both picked share, they would each receive $125,000. If one chose keep and one chose share, the keeper would win $250,000. However, if both greedily picked keep, the money would be split amongst the rest of the contestants.,While I was watching the earlier episodes of the season, I had always viewed Nick as the nice underdog with the eternally red face (whether from too many drinks or tanning under the California sun, I’ll never know) who kept away from the drama. He never won the competitions and was seen as the outsider – never quite accepted by the main alliance formed in the early stages of the show. The contestants on ,, along with viewers like me, never seriously considered him to have qualities that the winners of previous seasons portrayed.,It was therefore all the more shocking when Nick had the guts to publicly take the money all for himself. Rachel, who had just recently had her heart broken by fellow contestant Michael Stagliano and endured the guilt from betraying her best friend on the show to secure a win in the finale, came off as someone more “deserving” of the money. But in the end, she not only lost the guy, but the money too.,While what Nick did to Rachel was harsh and I probably would not have done the same if I were in his shoes, I understand his reasoning and stand by his case. Nick and Rachel were not partners from the beginning of the show; they ended up being forced together after Michael abruptly left the show. Having only been partners for a few weeks, they did not form the strong connection that other couples would have formed by then. In addition, Nick had to constantly endure Rachel’s pining for Michael and accept that Rachel would never have entered the partnership if she had a choice otherwise. In short, his desire to avenge the bitter feelings bottled up throughout the course of the season fueled his decision to place his own wants above someone else’s., is a game that pits money against love, trust, and friendship. Whether a contestant like Rachel is more “deserving” of the money doesn’t matter. Some may call Nick the evil snake in the grass, but he simply played the game well by making his move when all those around him least expected it. He picked the quarter of a million dollars, and there is nothing wrong with that if he personally felt that he won the game on his own. In this case, we should not hate the player but hate the game for creating an atmosphere that toys with emotions and changes human character for the worse.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/more-despicable-behavior-reality-television/,"

"William Shakespeare once wrote, “A fart by any other name would smell as stanky.” And it does: See toot, or passed gas, or broken wind, or cut cheese. Each euphemism refers to the same thing, and that thing is the expulsion of intestinal gas through the anus, often bearing an unpleasant aroma. ,Traveling north, however, we encounter a fart of opposite character. This fart carries only one name, but its nine short letters stand for a whole variety of complex, even contradictory functions. Rectal flatulence is simple, straightforward; cerebral flatulence poses a nearly unsolvable maze of meanings. ,I am speaking, of course, of the brain fart. ,In my own vernacular, the term brain fart refers to a minute memory lapse, an acceptable excuse for forgetting the name of a country, or a chemical, or an extremely well known celebrity: ,“You look just like—oh! Ugh, that guy, what’s his name. George something, the actor. From that movie, about the ocean? God, this is gonna kill me.” ,“George Clooney?”,“Right, him! Shrugs. Brain fart.”,Like a rectal fart, a brain fart is a natural, inescapable, and unforeseeable body function that can be humiliating to undergo in public. By farting, something you would prefer to not emit from your body is emitted against your conscious will. Your flesh defies your mind’s better intentions. ,But the parallel isn’t perfect; indeed the farts are in some ways quite opposite. With a rectal fart, you expel excess gas, a substance harmful to your body if kept inside for too long. Though it may be hard to admit, your body has done you a favor. With a brain fart, however, you unintentionally discharge information that you had wanted to keep; you suddenly and inexplicably lose a part of yourself that you had valued. In the latter case, the betrayal of the flesh is complete, and the fart, more sinister.,Seeking more information on the body’s darkest abilities, I turned, of course, to the Internet. Urban Dictionary, the web’s premiere slang compendium, includes a number of definitions for brain fart, and their most popular entries are roughly equivalent with my usage above. Their number one definition (currently rated at 331 thumbs up to 40 down) submitted by user David Peterle reads as follows:,“When you are attempting to remember something very obvious, something that you know you should know. This feeling often leads to head banging and hair pulling.”,Aarrgh, I should have known it was George Clooney! I don’t deserve these golden locks! Nor, unfortunately, does young Bobby, the subject of Mr. Peterle’s adorable sample sentence:,“[B]obby raised his hand to answer the teacher’s question only to find that he had had a brain fart, and he was unable to answer 2+2.”,Poor Bobby, cut down in the prime of his youth by a brain fart. But devastating as it is to forget the number four (and come on, who hasn’t been there), Bobby should thank his lucky stars he ended up on U.D. and not Wikipedia. The kinetic user-edited encyclopedia begins its article on brain farts as follows (or at least it does least today):,“A brain fart is slang for a special kind of abnormal brain activity which results in human error while performing a repetitive task, or more generally denoting a degree of mental laxity or any task-related forgetfulness, such as forgetting how to hold a fork.”,Forgetting how to hold a fork? That’s scary shit. The stakes of the brain fart have just been raised. Picture me and my cinephilic friend: I pause mid-sentence unable to utter George Clooney’s name, not because I can’t remember it—indeed, it flashes in neon in my mind—but because I’ve forgotten how to shape my mouth to pronounce that impossible |jôrj|. Picture little Bobby, just asked the sum of 2+2: He is quiet as a stone. The teacher calls his name again, and the whole class turns toward him; they too become frozen in place, horrified, as they witness their friend caught in the cold grasp of his inevitable capsize, slowly but surely tipping over the side of his seat, pushed by nothing but the force of his own weight. Deep behind his dead, blank eyes, Bobby’s mind desperately tries to recall how to sit in a chair. Shudder.,The Wiki-model brain fart recalls a different quality of the rectal fart, which is the sheer unpredictability of its magnitude. Like the U.D. usage, it too draws up contemplations of the body’s disobedience to the mind, but it extends its axis of severity. Rectal farts too occupy the full range of a scale: Sometimes, one knows when a fart is coming, and he can either hold it in and let it out in a more appropriate setting, or he can restrict its volume with precise bowel control. Sometimes, one knows when a fart is coming, and he tries to restrict its volume but finds his bowel control not as precise as he remembered, and the flatulence is humiliatingly audible. Sometimes, however, one does not know a fart is coming at all, and when it does, it is even louder than the fart-gone-wrong of our previous hypothetical, and our poor, nameless protagonist’s entire life is ruined, the one chance with the girl of his dreams literally blown away.,If you think this sounds bad, Wikipedia offers a second, even darker definition:,“The term is typically employed in the United States to indicate a regrettable and poorly thought out choice of action. According to Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Denis Gauthier a brainfart occurs when one “momentarily loses his sense of logic…and does something ‘dumb’.”,6’3” Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Denis Gauthier’s moment of dumbness was slamming 5’10” Kyle Wellwood through the boards of the Wachovia Center. While the Toronto Sun interviewer who provided the quote is skeptical of Gauthier’s innocence, Wiki provides a chilling clarification:,“Investigative journalist Louie Pierson…proffers that while accidents are preventable, “brain farts are unpredictable, unpreventable and universal.’”,Jesus Christ. The brain fart seems to have evolved from an innocuous, momentary slip of the mind to the malicious hijacking of the entire body. This model of brain fart has me unwillingly telling my Clooney-esque friend he looks like Paul Giamatti; and back in math class, Bobby doesn’t answer 2+2, but instead, as if pulled by the strings of an invisible puppeteer, knocks over his desk and pees all over his teacher. There is no rectal equivalent.,Actually, maybe sharting. Sharting is pretty bad.,But the brain fart starts looking up at our last frontier. Leaving behind those disreputable sites, we turn to Dictionary.com, “An Ask.com service,” which draws its definitions from more esteemed external sources like the Random House Dictionary and The Collin’s English Dictionary. For brain fart, however, they cite a more unconventional reference—something called the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (available at http://foldoc.org/). FOLDOC’s first definition of brain fart is almost impenetrably technical, but seems to indicate something along the lines of the Urban Dictionary model: ,“1.  The actual result of a braino, as opposed to the mental glitch that is the braino itself. E.g. typing “dir” on a Unix box after a session with MS-DOS.”,FOLDOC defines braino as “[a] thinko,” which it in turn defines as “a momentary, correctable glitch in mental processing…a bubble in the stream of consciousness.” Braino and thinko are in analogy to typo, or typographical error; a braino, then, is a contemplative error, a jam in the mental cogs; and a brain fart is its physical manifestation, i.e. punching out the wrong command. This definition is more or less the same as Wiki’s second example, if semantically refined.,Much more interesting is FOLDOC’s second definition:,“2. A biproduct of a bloated mind producing information effortlessly. A burst of useful information. ‘I know you’re busy on the Microsoft story, but can you give us a brain fart on the Mitnik bust?’”,Here a brain fart is a welcome, miraculous epiphany; it is a thing to be desired. Imagine young Bobby experiencing a brain fart of this manner in his mathematics classroom: Now he is unable to answer 2+2 because he has spontaneously disproved the set theory that defends the validity of addition itself. Imagine me with my handsome friend: I can’t invoke George Clooney’s name because I’ve developed deep and challenging notions regarding the ephemeral natures of fame and celebrity.,If we are to accept this definition of brain fart, we must rethink our consideration of the mother fart too. Would you ever ask a co-worker to give you a fart? Can a fart be pleasant, even desired? Does brain fart’s etymological integrity stand? I think, upon reflection, that it does. ,Farts are a cornerstone of American humor. See South Park’s Terrence and Philip, the pair of wisecracking, cheek-cracking Canadians who entertain our favorite Coloradoan boys on TV, much to the chagrin of their fart-intolerant parents. “Ugh, South Park is such juvenile humor,” you object, and maybe you’re right. But that doesn’t mean it’s not funny—when Stan and Kyle laugh, we viewers laugh too, because it feels right to enjoy and celebrate farts, and any crusty old Sheila Broflovski who says otherwise is just a square.,And it’s not just South Park, or America for that matter—let’s return to our pal Willy, one of the most respected writers of the English language who ever was. Consider this real, totally not made up exchange from Othello (Act III, Scene I if you don’t believe me):,CLOWN: Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?,FIRST MUSICIAN: Ay marry are they, sir.,CLOWN: O, thereby hangs a tail.,FIRST MUSICIAN: Whereby hangs a tail, sir?,CLOWN: Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument I know.,Get it? He’s talking about a butt! Still think fart jokes are juvenile, Sheila Broflovski? Because Shakespeare thinks they’re pretty legit.,There are, then, many ways to take a fart, be it from the bowels or the brain. A minor annoyance, a calamitous misfortune, a joyful surprise—it all depends on your attitude. ,Until next time, plbhphphbhlh.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/cerebral-flatulence/,"

"Saying goodbye to the dirtiest of my dirty pleasures hasn’t been easy. Especially since I am a relatively clean (and some would say highly self-disciplined) person. And so my recent farewell to Entourage, HBO’s eight-season series on the glories of Hollywood life, has consequently become a reflective experience. Mainly because I have lost the only television show I watch, and now need to reflect on the numerous other shows that I have to choose from. More importantly, however, because I need to reflect on what I have learned from Entourage, and why I have wasted so many hours watching it. ,If you watch the show already, you may be thinking: “She probably tivos each episode and fast-forwards through all the scenes that don’t include Vince.” This is, on some occasions, an accurate assumption. Who is Vince, an Entourage novice might ask? Vince is Entourage’s golden boy, the show’s Queens-born movie star to whom all the ladies flock and “total bro” to whom all of Vince’s “homies” cling. For eight seasons, Entourage has showcased the goings-on of Vince, played by the cupid-like Adrian Grenier, and his posse. Vince’s world is one of fancy cars, big paychecks, the frequent “mush” (fine, I also watch Jersey Shore), innumerable tequila shots, and angry Hollywood agents. Entourage is a show of excess—a study of glamorous celebrity life on steroids. ,So how might you, a Princeton pseudo-intellectual and Entourage newbie, make sense of all this excess? And why should you trade your Kant for this kant-be-missed television show, brimming with all sorts of life lessons? Princeton students always need reasons. Below, allow me to intellectualize Entourage for you so that you can justify the forty minutes you are about to spend in Firestone watching this T.V. show. ,_Lesson 1: Good Friends are Good_,My empirical examination of the lessons of Entourage begins with a discussion of Vince’s wolf pack. The wolf pack is composed of Vince and his childhood friends: his half-brother Johnny, his manager Eric, or “E,” his driver Turtle, and his agent Ari. Forget all the great friendships and mentorships that you have scrutinized in your history classes. If you were to ask Socrates, what is friendship? He would most likely reply as follows: “I am not certain what friendship is, nor do I know its qualities. But I do know that Vince and his buds are like brothas from another motha.” ,Put simply, Vince and his four friends teach us that good friends are necessary for our happiness. We need good friends to keep us rational and inspired. We also rely on our good friends to convince our significant others and crushes that we are worthy of their time (and our marriage proposals). Take the 96th episode of Entourage—the grand finale. In no other episode does Vince’s gang collaborate more effectively to achieve a common goal, namely: convince Sophia, Vince’s love interest, that she should marry Vince. Johnny, E, and Turtle gather together all of Vince’s ex-girlfriends (hint: this is a large population of women) in order to interview and film their thoughts on Vince. This on-screen collage of women, all of who praise Vince as a champion boyfriend, motivates Sophia to accept Vince’s proposal. Great success!,Having provided you with evidence about the power of friendship in Entourage, I feel obligated to moralize about how Vince’s relationships with his friends should dictate your own. Trying to decide whether to spend an hour studying for your Spanish quiz or playing FIFA with your Euro friends? Channel your inner Vince to resolve this dilemma. Have a friend in desperate need of a wingman? Ask yourself, WWVD (What Would Vince Do)? It is through Vince and his friends that we keep our priorities in line. ,_Lesson 2: It’s Good To Be Bad (Sometimes)_,Let me preface this portion of my analysis with the following declaration: I do not support any serious infringement of the law. That said, Entourage teaches us that—as the subheading suggests—it’s good to be bad (sometimes). ,Naughtiness is a dominant theme throughout the series. The naughtiness factor of each episode ranges from playfully naughty to legitimately (and at times offensively) naughty. Evidence is endless. In season six, Entourage gives us playfully naughty. We watch on as Turtle takes classes at UCLA and becomes the butt of a sorority joke, in which sorority girls steal Vince’s underwear via their friendship with Turtle. On the other end of the spectrum, Vince’s season-seven relationship with Sasha, a porn-star, becomes dangerously naughty when Vince ends up in rehab because of his cocaine addiction, induced by that of Sasha. Here Entourage instructs us that being bad is in fact bad when cocaine is involved.,We should adopt the messages exhibited in the two above scenes into our own lives. We should be fun-loving; be spontaneous; go out on school nights even if we have homework due the next day! Can you say scandalous? ,_Lesson 3: Girl Power is Good_,Central to Entourage’s plot are Sloan McQuewick, E’s girlfriend-meets-fiancé-meets-baby-mama, and Ari’s wife, Melissa. For the purposes of this analysis, I will ignore the fact that Sloan, played by Emanuelle Chiqri, and Melissa, played by Perrey Reeves, are extraordinarily attractive women. Aesthetics aren’t important here. Instead, I investigate the ways in which Sloan and Melissa exhibit “girl-power.” Sloan and Melissa are ferocious, and we see their ferocity in both personal and professional settings. ,Entourage’s leading ladies teach us that we can, on some occasions, manipulate the men in our lives for a greater good. Melissa often blames Ari for his skewed values—the reign of his professional life over his family. She keeps her husband in check by jeopardizing the financial state of his company, which she helps to back with her inheritance money. Similarly, Sloan often makes use of her familial relations with E and Ari’s rival, Terrance McQuewick, owner of his own talent agency and father of Sloan, to ensure that E is respectful both in the workplace and at home. ,Malicious or cunning? You decide. Needless to say, these vixens know how to use the power they carve out in all sorts of crafty ways to their advantage. They are each Beyoncé’s “Independent Woman” incarnate. We Princeton women should take a cue from all three divas in our relations with Princeton men. Can you please “throw your hands up at me?” (N.B.: I do not take responsibility for any of the break-ups that ensue after the publishing of this article.),Are these three lessons reason enough for you to begin watching Entourage, Princeton student seeking a pop-culturally sound life? If yes, then I bid adieu to you and you should bid adieu to all productive study sessions. I guarantee you that the time you spend watching Entourage from here on will stimulate you more and prepare you less for your next exam. I call this an excellent trade-off, and I know Vince wouldn’t have it any other way.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/what-would-vince-do/,"

"By now many have seen the picture of Dr. Cornel West at Occupy Wall Street holding a sign that reads, “If only the war on poverty was a real war then we would actually be putting money into it.” Or, more recently, video was released of Dr. West being arrested during a protest outside the Supreme Court, his message being that the court system gives too much power to those with the most money.,The movement, which began in mid-September, is focused on this idea of the national interest having been construed to satisfy the top 1% first—hence the slogan “We are the 99%.” While this serves as the main, somewhat vague binding issue, there is no set agenda. Some are protesting the difficulty of finding decent health care coverage, some the impossible debts they’ve incurred, some budget cuts to important institutions, and some who don’t face these circumstances simply standing alongside those who do. The breadth of the protests have led many to believe the cause lacks unity and coherence, possibly even reminiscent of the riots that broke out in England this past summer. Others have branded the movement far too disorganized and idealistic to make a difference.,While change has yet to be achieved in the way of legal action (i.e. legislation, or Supreme Court rulings), the month or so of protests has had quite an impact on culture, the media, and even the world. The protests quickly gained a popular following through social media sites, and have since spread to the rest of the country. The beginning of this month saw a string of similar protests across the nation in major cities like Los Angeles and Seattle. There was even one woman who held an “Occupy the Tundra” march by herself (with her dogs accompanying her). This past week, the movement spread beyond the U.S. to Europe. In cities across the continent, people protested the massive cuts and the mishandling of the current financial crisis that threatens to plunge the E.U. into another downward spiral. Thousands were reported to have gathered in a peaceful protest (which they named “Occupy the Stock Exchange”) against the financial system. While it was hardly greeted eagerly by police forces, the London protest did get a visit from WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange. ,Speaking of police forces, in its first weeks Occupy Wall Street brought a lot of unwanted attention to the NYPD and their sometimes unnecessarily brutal tactics for maintaining order. Numerous videos were posted all over the Internet of police picking and choosing protesters to arrest, with or without provocation; and one officer was seen spraying mace at two women in an orange police pen. Such events have called into question the methods being used in New York City by police forces to prevent crime, including the question of racial profiling as a way of identifying possible “criminals.” ,As with the Arab Spring Raid, Occupy Wall Street gained a lot of momentum through the use of social media, particularly Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Interestingly, it has also sparked opposition movements, such as “We are the 53%,” where middle-class Americans blame the protesters for creating their problems and being too lazy to work to fix their situation. The same dichotomy is reflected in the news media. “The Last Word” with Lawrence O’Donnell on MSNBC aired a piece highlighting the violence being displayed not by protestors but by police officers, from an obviously empathetic point of view. Sean Hannity, on the other hand, told a protester she was “trying to destroy America” and “did not believe in freedom.” (For those interested, Jon Stewart highlights Hannity’s seemingly contradictory opinions on Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party movement’s beginnings in 2009.) ,As with most issues, it has sparked quite a bit of debate, specifically over the implications as regards the Obama administration and the 2012 presidential race. Some feel it is a display of dissatisfaction with the policies and the legislation (or lack thereof) of the current president and his party; this, presumably, is good news for Republicans. However, most say it is not disapproval of only one party or any one person, but of the government as a whole, of the way people have perceived the relationship between the wealthy and the leaders of the country. ,While Occupy Wall Street may be controversial, naïve, and lacking direction, there is no denying that it is commanding the attention of people across the nation and around the world. As the year of revolution draws to a close, the 99% are commanding the stage. No one can be sure how it will end or what will become of the movement, but to see so many people from so many different backgrounds come together peacefully for change is, in the least, a testament against the idea that people don’t care enough to try.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/we-have-99-problems/,"

"First it was Guitar Hero. Then came Rock Band. They even had DJ Hero. For those aspiring “musicians” who can’t play an instrument but still want the thrill of playing and creating music, there has been a recent string of technological innovations to help fill the creative void. Now, as creative software makes computers more capable, you hardly need to pick up an instrument—even if it is a plastic guitar controller—to kick out the jams. The recent explosion of house music, electronica, and dare I say it, dubstep, can be attributed almost entirely to the availability and ease with which users can create music on their computers.,So, the question now arises, is this newfound musical outlet a good thing or a bad thing? One could easily argue both sides. On one hand, these technological innovations allow virtually anyone to create music. Those who can’t afford a full drum kit, a guitar, an amp, and a microphone can now stage a full band with the click of a mouse. Those who couldn’t, or didn’t, want to take music lessons as children can now fiddle around on their plug-in MIDI keyboard and suddenly create a hit single in a matter of hours. The point is, anyone these days, from your little sister to your grandfather, could feasibly open up their MacBook, start Garageband, and create music with clever loops and built-in mics in an instant. Programs like Garageband, Ableton, and ProLogic give any average Joe the creative power to make music in their spare time. Creativity is right at your fingertips, and with the music industry going increasingly more digital with each day, people are almost encouraged to make music on their computer for the sake of convenience. Online DJ superstars can make a huge name for themselves without even revealing their true identities.,On the other hand, there are some who could argue that the creation of music is a unique process that requires legitimate, rare skill. These are the same people who mourn the loss of the printed book, as they believe it to be the purest form of the art. Take artists like indie savior Jack White, who, whether it’s through his Third Man Records or any of his numerous critically acclaimed bands, refuses to even look at a computer when he records his music. A diehard advocate of vinyl, White, among many other indie artists and followers, would probably tend to believe that the computer takes away from the soul of making music. They would claim that the art of collaboration between musicians, the real-life hiccups that come with live performance, and the “realness” of the sound all get lost when one takes to a computer to record his or her music. There’s a certain way in which a truly skillful artist can make his instrument really evoke soul in a way that a computer cannot. Jimi Hendrix, who could make his guitar wail and cry like a scorned beast in a way no computer could authentically replicate, is a perfect example. Indeed, this purist mentality does demand a sense of real musical talent and creativity, so in that sense, perhaps these artists make a case for upholding the creative demands of the music industry. Let’s face it, music today does have the ability to become watered down, or even mocked, with every teenage pop viral hit. Do I need look any further than the shining instance of Rebecca Black’s online hit, “Friday”?,One other variable to examine in this debate is the computer itself, which, some may argue, has become a legitimate musical instrument in its own right. It’s certainly true that the vast majority of electronic music out there today has been created on exclusively on computers, mainly because there’s no other platform on which to create such music. Whether a computer counts as a legitimate musical instrument or a mere vessel through which to convey blaring house tracks depends largely on one’s own personal definition of “music.” I won’t get into that debate. You can decide that one for yourself.,I spoke recently with Princeton freshman Matt Rogers about this ever-pressing issue. Rogers, who makes electronic music and publishes it online under the moniker Mr. Rogers Productions, proclaims himself an advocate of the use of computers in the music making process. He says, “I absolutely think that music-making programs are helpful in developing not only the music industry, but also the art form of music itself. The first reason for this is the increased accessibility. Now anyone with a computer and the will to learn some music theory can make music ranging from a single instrument melody, to a full-instrument orchestral symphony.” Rogers, who said he does not currently play any instruments but played violin through much of high school, says that the aforementioned instrument purists can be narrow minded in their creative musical approach: “I think the view that ‘real’ music needs to be made with ‘real’ instruments is both pretentious and narrow-minded. Sticking to music that relies only on real instruments is in my opinion, very limiting, because there are hundreds of random kinds of instruments out there, [and] on a computer not only can you sample all of those sounds, but you can harness virtually any other sound you can imagine, as long as you can figure out how to program the synthesizer.” There is certainly a sound case to be made for the accessibility and dexterity a computer offers any musician that may not be the case in, say, a practice room stocked only with a piano, drums, and one guitar amp.,Rogers, however, does note that musical instruments are important and not to be forgotten in the music industry. He says, “I am by no means saying that all music should be made on a computer; there is definitely a really full sound that comes from live or recorded performance with real instruments, but using a computer to make music opens up so many possibilities that it is narrow minded to deem it not “real” music. Personally, my favorite music comes from a conjunction of the two; some of my favorite hip-hop songs are computer-edited samples of real instruments being played, giving them a really organic sound.” I tend to agree with Matt’s view that a good balance is necessary for a successful future of music. There’s no denying the huge potential that computers offer music makers, and yet there’s not denying the true soul that comes from a live instrument being played. In my opinion, music can be treated the same way as the printed book has been recently. There’s valid sentimental and taste preferential value to a good old-fashioned printed book, but there’s also the practical, eco-friendly advantages of online texts. So let’s find some common ground for music, too. Like anything in life, whether it’s a PB&J sandwich or a classic liberal arts education, balance is a very good thing, so instrument purists, give computers a chance, and computer freaks, give those instruments a chance too!",http://www.nassauweekly.com/macbook-virtuosos/,"

"A chance encounter; a fated beginning; a supernatural love connection infused with sweat and Top 40 pop hits. It’s not often that two lovebirds meet under these enchanting auspices and forget each other’s names almost instantly. Yet such was the case in the tale of Skip McDod and Allie Wick, who are to be married Saturday at a small church in Bethesda, Maryland.,“I noticed Allie from the minute I saw her de-foaming her beer in the T.I. (Tiger Inn) tap room,” Skip remarked. A self-proclaimed wallflower throughout his Princeton career, Skip explained that he immediately headed over to the tap where Allie was standing to chug a few beers before introducing himself. “She was the popular, bubbly type,” Skip remarked. “I definitely needed to get blacked if I wanted to make a move.”,Indeed it wasn’t love at first grind—but grind they did. The result? An extended dance floor make-out. He proceeded to forget her name and she to vomit on him on the walk to the Wa(wa convenience store). No phone numbers were exchanged, no Wa-dogs purchased. Almighty Fate did not look favorably on the pair.,As freshman year progressed, Allie grew restless. Her friends attempted to console her in Marquand Library each evening as she stared at blank Microsoft Word documents and furtively sucked down F’real milkshakes purchased at the C-Store. But their calming words were to no avail. In reflecting on her passion-less year—save that one pre-vomit night on the dance floor with her mystery boy—Allie explained: “I sulked that I wouldn’t find love at Princeton. I stalked Princeton Facebook repeatedly in hopes of determining the name of the one boy with whom I swayed to Avicii.”,Lest their first meeting “Fade into Darkness,” Skip, too, pursued Allie, albeit in his own way. Skip’s friends described him as the “total go-getter, over-achiever type,” evidenced only in part by his devotion to the Varsity Crew team while at Princeton. They recalled the way that Skip would stand outside of McCosh Hall, the nexus of Princeton’s classes in the humanities, and, in hopes that he would find Allie, assault any girl with strawberry blond hair. “He would chase after them, even if it meant climbing three flights of stairs to McCosh 10 (lecture hall). It was creepy,” his best man and former lightweight crew teammate remarked.,It wasn’t until their junior year that the star-crossed lovers would meet again. This time, their interaction would prove vomit-free. Skip and Allie, both majors in Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School, unknowingly selected the same semester-long task force, entitled, “The Tanzanian Child and Me: Education Through the Pen Pal.” A weighty topic, no doubt, one that would reignite a weighty passion between Skip and Allie.,“I looked up at our first task force meeting and there she was,” Skip announced with a sigh. “Well, I wasn’t able to see her initially, because she had 10 books about the development of the Tanzanian child stacked in front of her. But I just knew it was her.”  One name game confirmed all. Her name was Allie; she was a junior from Bethesda, Maryland and a Bent Spoon cupcake enthusiast. He was Skip, a junior from San Diego, California with a weakness—almost immediately discernible—for words like “thrust,” “crux,” and “gist.” Neither Allie nor Skip could recount any of the information taught during that first task force. “Admittedly, I hadn’t had any coffee that morning,” Allie said. “But I also couldn’t focus on my Tanzanian pen pal when Skip, my American life partner to be, was sitting right across the table.”,Skip chased Allie out of class—a habit to which he had grown accustomed during his two-year long search (now complete)—and stopped her just short of the Woody Woo fountain. Having finally found her, he wasted no time. He kissed her and mumbled, “I like Bent Spoon cupcakes too!” Skip and Allie would never spend a day apart until their graduation.,Allie and Skip pursued their passions in post-graduate life; for three years, these respective passions brought them far apart. “We knew we had to go our separate ways—to do the things we always wanted to do on our own—in order to come back together,” Allie remarked. Allie travelled to Tanzania through the Peace Corps, where she applied her task force knowledge to real-life Tanzanians. Meanwhile, Skip moved to New York to work for a large investment bank. “We both put in long, grueling hours of work doing the things we love,” Skip remarked. “It was worth it in the end.”,Skip knew he had to make things official the first night Allie returned from Tanzania. “Skip picked me up at Newark Airport and, to my surprise, drove me to Princeton,” Allie said. They ate chicken gyros at Zorba’s Grill and recounted their time apart. Midway through the meal, the waitress brought out an order of hummus and pita slices. At the bottom of thehummus dish was a ring. Without delay, Allie said yes and wept; her tears made the pita soggy.,In planning the wedding, Skip and Allie were struck by their good fortune. “Most nights at T.I. don’t result in a marriage—maybe a shared slice of Frist (Campus Center) pizza, at best,” Allie explained. Skip agreed sincerely. “I may have forgotten her name that first night,” he said, “but I haven’t been able to get her out of my mind since.”,The wedding guests, which include Allie and Skip’s task force professor, Skip’s former teammates, and Allie’s Tanzanian “family,” should look forward to a reception rife with Princeton-related touches. “We got Olives to cater the event,” said Allie with delight. “And we attached our place cards to Princeton lanyards!” From Tiger Inn to Tanzania, their love for Princeton—and for one another—has only grown deeper.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/weddings-and-celebrations/,"

"Never before this week had I been hospitalized. Like most kids, I hang on every word that’s said on ER and Scrubs. I look to the bravery of the doctors and patients alike and am always left wondering, When will that be me?,It began, like so many of the adventures of our generation, at a Qdoba urinal. I was texting when I looked down to discover that the urinal looked like it was filled with the end result of a fish in a blender with the purée button pushed for at least half an hour: brown and red, and watery.,“Hooray!” I shouted. “I’ve been chosen.”,If you’ve seen the Golden Ticket scene from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory you’ll have a pretty good idea of what followed. I ran outside, crying “I peed blood! I peed blood!” Everyone at the Qdoba threw up a cheer. The girl at the counter rang the bell so many times that free burritos began to fall from the ceiling.,I ran up to the frisbee team, still seated, “Have you ever peed blood after a tournament before!?” I asked.,“No!” They screamed, “You must be headed for the hospital!”,I decided not to get cocky: I had better start with McCosh. I felt like I was gliding as I walked there, on a gurney already, just knowing that my journey wouldn’t end at University Health.,“Oh that’s wonderful!” They said when I told them, “Do you think you could do it again?”,A rush of terror: Could I? I said I’d do my best and walked into the bathroom. I’ve never been so nervous in my life. What if I had messed up? What if that was the only blood my bladder got? I called Qdoba to see if it was still in the urinal but some Catholics had gotten to it first, in case I ever get canonized.,I decided to just follow procedure. Open cup, ready sterile wipe, begin to pee in toilet, clean unit with sterile wipe, pee in cup. But even the half second I was peeing into the toilet let me know that everything was going to be okay. I walked out of that bathroom with perfect posture, holding a cup filled with what unmistakably, triumphantly contained blood; and one P-Safe ride later I was at the genuine ER.,—,The above description is a dramatization, but I really did think it would be an adventure somehow. I’ve never broken a bone, never had a serious illness; the only stitches I’ve ever gotten were from surgeons my dad knew and so took place in their kitchens. I wanted the blood to mean something. And nothing. I had made a number of heroic dives in a day of frisbee, landed on my stomach and chest a bunch and I wanted to have peed blood as a result of it. And then I wanted the problem to be over: no long-term kidney disease being a hope. It wasn’t really through a desire to legitimize the sport in the eyes of the public. (If you don’t understand the irony present in explaining to people that you’re pissing blood because you played a whole day of Ultimate Frisbee then God bless you, but you probably do: Everybody wrote it down, but nobody believed it. One doctor asked if I’d hurt myself playing Extreme Frisbee.) I just wanted to feel cool.,I felt immediately like I was in the future. They have these forehead thermometers. No longer are we in an age that requires us to stick mercury up our butts or in our mouths (did anyone else ever use the armpit?). They’ve got this wand now that’s straight out of Star Trek and they touch it to your forehead and it knows your temperature in two seconds. I’m not very old, but that blows my mind. Blood pressure is all automatic too, I was surprised to learn. The IV is still pretty pure; good old gravity is still chugging along.,Eric wheeled me to the CAT scan room. He was a first or second generation immigrant from I don’t know where. Right as he started pushing me, he asked me, “If I’m getting a laptop for seven hundred dollars, but can get a notebook for five-fifty, what’s the better deal?” I had him repeat himself. I asked, “Isn’t a notebook the same thing as a laptop?” I thought that the latter was just the old name, replaced because using them on top of your lap makes your sperm count suffer. He didn’t know about sperm like I did. “Notebook is just like a smaller one. But I took the notebook, because I’ve already got a laptop and it works pretty well.” I told him I guessed he’d done right. There’s a short story called “Emergency” that focuses on a pair of orderlies at a hospital that are on a ton of drugs and run around and having interactions that don’t make sense. Eric made me think of “Emergency.”,If you haven’t had a CAT scan, they warn you what it feels like, but not wholly. They focus on the fact that you’re going to feel like you’re peeing, and tell you not to worry. But it’s not that often that you feel your blood. Maybe when you’re pumping adrenaline in a moment of shock, but never when you’re calm and thinking about what’s going on in your blood. Imagine the experience of a hot drink, but with a horribly awry trajectory. A warmth that enters, not your mouth, but your arm, before going for the back of your neck rather than your throat and then sliding down your spine. The lingering feeling is not in your belly, but your bladder. It’s pretty weird. I had never had a CAT scan, but I had seen the “Scrubs” episode where JD flirts with this girl who’s in a CAT scan machine that jammed. The point is that he asks her out without seeing her face so it’s this gamble, but you only see the outside of the machine. I wanted to know what the inside was like.,Eric wheeled me back, not seeming to remember me or our notebook discussion. When I got back, the nurse told me I’d been diagnosed with rabdo mylisis, breakdown of muscle tissue due to exercising while dehydrated. This later turned out to be  untrue. My dad—a doctor, who, though not in this line of medicine nor in this state, involved himself in every step (and, amazingly knew exactly what was going on at all times)—looked at the writeup for my urine sample and told me I hadn’t been dehydrated, end of story. But the nurse gave me other some thought-provokers as well. She told me if friends visited me they couldn’t be drunk because things got too loud. She told me the only thing good about New Jersey was that it was close to the City and the beach, but that she didn’t care about the city. She told me not to go to Terrace, because it hospitalizes more people than the other clubs. She asked me if I wanted juice.,It should be noted that though I narrate all these things as if they happened in quick succession, there was a lot of waiting involved. Waiting in the Waiting Room, waiting for the doctor, waiting for the nurse, waiting for the nurse to take out my IV so I could go to the bathroom. (The rabdo diagnosis had called for the infusion of my arm with five liters of water. It took forever and made me pee.) My primary occupation during all this waiting was distracting myself from reading A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again (which, if DFW hadn’t got to it first, would have been a snappy title for this piece) by texting people with the news that I’d pissed blood and was in the hospital. I don’t know why it gave me such joy to do this. I understood the gap between my actual state and what “I just pissed SO MUCH BLOOD,” suggested. I guess I wanted to be—not really pitied, because there was nothing pitiable about my situation—but at least thought about, at least interesting.,My friends came and one of them was a little drunk, but not too much, so he didn’t arouse the suspicion of my nurse or anyone with a badge. He did, however, ignore my insistence to stay off the gross hospital floor and received some of the incredulous wrath of my nurse when he lied down. It was a good time and I felt good about this distraction from reading my book. I was getting sleepy.,Finally I was ready to go home. My friends had come, people on both coasts of the US of A had expressed concern at my well-being (via text), I had ridden the whirring CAT-scan machine, a nurse had brought me juice in a cup, my profile picture was me making a face in my hospital gown; in short, I had gotten everything one could hope from a visit to the hospital. I knew nothing was wrong with me: my urine had long since made the progression from being the color of barbecue sauce to that of rosé wine before getting back to looking like Grade A regular pee. But joyrides to the hospital don’t work so well, because hospitals exist for people with real problems. I wasn’t in real trouble, so I wasn’t getting the high level of attention required for someone who wants to go home when he’s ready. They didn’t want to underdiagnose me, so they kept me and ran too many tests with way too much of my blood.,So I lay back in the fantasy that I would be going home, not suspecting that between UMC and McCosh I would spend another twelve hours in an infirmary, alone, always thinking I was about to be discharged; that I would get my blood drawn so much in the next week that I would move past my initial blood-donation-style excitement and fully into the ache that made me think of Requiem for a Dream and having to tell a nurse she could find a vein in my other arm; or that even weirder than people look at you when you tell them you peed blood is when you try to tell them it was normal. So all in all, it was interesting, but didn’t turn out to be that fun. I guess I can say I’ve been to the hospital. And can you really put a price on a choice profile picture?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/hospital-stories2/,"

"Another year of movies has come and gone. I addressed you glorious readers on the state of the Grammys not too long ago and expressed my general despondence at what their nominations had to offer. Now I am back to discuss the upcoming Academy Awards, an awards ceremony which I have usually held in higher regard than the Grammys for its ability to maintain general relevance. The Oscars, it seems, make a much better attempt at staying in touch with the direction of good cinema these days and do a somewhat commendable job of rewarding said cinema. The Academy, however, is certainly not without its shortcomings. Where the Grammys received my harangues as a result of their being hopelessly out of touch with popular music, I must here mildly chide the Academy for being, on the whole, pretty predictable, almost to the degree that I can (hopefully) predict the winners without even having seen all the movies in contention. In the following article, I’ll dispel my reflections on the Oscars as they stand now, along the way making some predictions of my own for your reading pleasure.,2011 has some very, how shall I say, interesting qualities about it when it comes to movies, specifically those in Oscar contention. First of all, movies in 2011 were going up against some very stiff competition from their predecessors. 2010 was a phenomenal year for cinema, featuring such giants as The King’s Speech, The Social Network, Black Swan, The Fighter, True Grit, 127 Hours, Toy Story 3, and even Inception. So, maybe my expectations were a little high, but all in all, I must say that 2011 was a bit underwhelming as a year of movies. At least this year we get to see Billy Crystal host the Oscars again in all his shining glory instead of having to watch that awkward-a-thon that was Anne Hathaway and James Franco leading the ceremony last year. Underwhelming movies notwithstanding, the Academy still must nominate someone, so we’ll take a look at what they’ve selected, and a little bit at what they haven’t selected, to see if we can figure out just what the Academy is up to.,Best Actor: Why Gary Oldman should win, but probably won’t. So here’s the deal. Gary Oldman has been, and continues to be, one of the most outstanding character actors of our time. I can point to a myriad of roles, from Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy, to the ever-wicked Stansfield in Leon: The Professional, even to Sirius Black in the Harry Potter movies. Yet, despite great acting over a decades-long career, the man has never been nominated for an Oscar. Until now! At long last, the Academy came to their senses and nominated Oldman for his portrayal of John Le Carre’s George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Oldman did an outstanding job playing this subdued, manipulative, anti-spy character and rightly deserves the nomination and, in my opinion, the Oscar itself, if not at the very least for his achievements that have been overlooked for too many years. Yet, I can predict to you faithful readers that he will not win the Oscar. Why not? The answer is simple. His movie, for a reason lost on me, didn’t do as well critically or in the box office as people anticipated. That’s bad news for a Best Actor contender. If we go by last year’s Best Actor win by Colin Firth in The King’s Speech, which also won Best Picture and Best Director, then Oldman is likely to lose out to George Clooney in The Descendants or Jean Dujardin in The Artist. Both of these actors have already grabbed Best Actor Golden Globes for these movies and are in movies that are not only nominees but are frontrunners for the Best Picture category. For Gary’s sake, I’m hoping my prediction is wrong, but just because I have to pick one, I’ll go with Dujardin as the underdog-with-a-heart-of-gold win. Plus, the Oscars like seeing movies about movies. Why else do we think Hugo got the Best Picture nomination? Because of Scorsese? Maybe.,Best Actress: Why Meryl Streep will (in all likelihood) win. The Academy, for all its claims of progressive thinking and forward seeking, sure likes to turn back the clocks, especially when it comes to historical figures, most notably British ones. Again I cite Colin Firth’s win in The King’s Speech. (Disclaimer: Colin Firth did a fantastic job in that movie and deserved the Oscar. I’m not knocking his win so much as trying to point out the patterns of the Academy). But apart from Firth, we don’t have to look back too far to see the Academy’s anglophilic tendencies. Helen Mirren won Best Actress not too long ago in 2007’s The Queen. So when Meryl Streep, who has already been nominated seventeen times and won twice, steps up to play Margaret Thatcher in this year’s The Iron Lady, is it that ridiculous to think that she’s got a good shot at taking home the trophy? I think not. She did, after all, do an impressive job in that role, though the movie itself was just okay. Streep’s only obstacle may be the same that Gary Oldman faces. That is, her movie isn’t nominated for Best Picture. The only competition I think she’ll have is from Viola Davis, who delivers a stirring performance in the Best Picture-nominated The Help. This should be a good bout. In a side note, does anyone out there think Rooney Mara deserves some love for tackling Lisbeth Salander in Fincher’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo? I’m still undecided, as compelling a role as it was…,Best Supporting Actors: A category of little (okay, perhaps some) consequence. Maybe it’s just because last year’s Supporting categories were almost more exciting than the Lead categories, but I’m not seeing all that much to care about here. Regarding Best Supporting Actor, I think Jonah Hill would be an interesting nod for Moneyball, and I thought Nick Nolte did very well in the incredibly underappreciated Warrior, but there’s little to excite me in this category. I’ll go out on a shaky limb and predict they give the Oscar to Kenneth Branagh for My Week With Marilyn, primarily just because most everyone knows who Kenneth Branagh is. The Supporting Actress category is a bit more compelling, because it would be interesting to see Melissa McCarthy take home an Oscar for her comedic role in Bridesmaids. There are also two nominees from The Help in this category, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain, who get an added boost from that Best Picture nomination. Based mostly on probability, I predict that one of those two—I’ll guess Spencer, just because—will edge out Berenice Bejo from The Artist for the Oscar, though if the Academy decides to go with Bejo, I don’t think it would be a terrible pick. ,Best Animated Film. I’ll make this short. Pixar shot themselves in the foot and decided to make Cars 2 this year instead of looking for an Oscar nomination, so their four-year streak of winning this award is over. Rango should win this category, because Kung Fu Panda 2 was a sequel and Puss In Boots was Puss In Boots. They also won’t give it to A Cat in Paris  or Chico & Rita because no one’s heard of those.,Best Director. This category is actually very much up in the air, seeing as all five nominees’ films are nominated for Best Picture as well, which is usually the case. The Academy does like Scorsese a lot, but I don’t think he’ll win for Hugo. Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life was stirring and ambitious, but the movie came out so long ago that few people remember it now. The same is mostly true for Woody Allen’s Midnight In Paris. So, again, it comes down to The Descendants versus The Artist, which I think will be the final showdown in Best Picture as well. This one’s a toss-up. Sorry. I can’t decide here.,The always underappreciated Best Screenplay awards: I love the awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay. A good script is what makes a good movie. Now maybe I think that just because I’m a writer, but if you’re looking to spice up your Oscar viewing experience, pay attention to these. This year, Adapted Screenplay is the more exciting category, with heavy hitters like Moneyball, The Descendants, The Ides of March (why did this movie not get nominated for more awards?), and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I think Moneyball may be out because Aaron Sorkin, whom I love and admire as a writer, won this category last year for The Social Network. The Academy only gives back-to-back winners for serious matters (where you at, Pixar?), so I think they’ll pass on Sorkin. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was fantastic as a film, and Le Carre’s tome of a novel must have been incredibly tough to adapt from. So there’s that to consider. I’m going to root for The Ides of March in this one, simply because I think it deserved more nominations. The Original Screenplay category is tougher to decide, though it would be cool to see SNL veteran Kristen Wiig snatch up an Oscar for Bridesmaids. I think Woody Allen’s Midnight In Paris is also worth considering, as is Michel Hazanavicius’ screenplay for The Artist, because it’s The Artist.,FINALLY, THE BEST PICTURE PREDICTION. Folks, this one’s tough. There isn’t exactly a clear frontrunner, nor is there really even a group of frontrunners. A lot of critics are pointing to either The Descendants or The Artist to take the prize. After all, both movies took home Best Picture victories at the Golden Globes. But The Help has been gaining a lot of steam, especially after it cleaned house at the Screen Actors’ Guild Awards. I liked Moneyball a lot, but I don’t think it’s quite Best Picture worthy. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close will absolutely not win. It just won’t. This nomination came out of nowhere. Hugo is a contender because, again, it’s Scorsese. The Tree of Life and Midnight In Paris both came out a little too long ago, and I’m not sure either of those were quite fantastic enough to oust the more recently released frontrunners. If I absolutely had to pick one, I think the Academy will go for a somewhat out-of-the-box choice after last year’s relatively predictable outcome and pick the silent film The Artist.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/oscar-noms/,"

But now that I have your undivided blank stares I guess I should probably do my job. The geyser was named in 1870 by Henry D. Washburn and was the first geyser in Yellowstone,to receive a name. Eruptions can shoot 3700 to 8400 gallons of boiling water 106 to 185 feet in the air every 45 to 125 minutes lasting for 1.5 to 5 minutes do you see what I mean by reliable. Over time, the length of the interval between eruptions has—oh there it goes. Do,what you gotta do. Yes thank you. Ok.—before I was so rudely interrupted, I was saying that over time, the length of the interval between eruptions has increased.

"Unless you have been living under a rock for the past two weeks, you know about the mass demonstrations in Egypt, Mubarak’s decision to turn off the internet in order to stop Twitter (sorry Kanye, revolution is  #thebestthingevertweeted), how Anderson Cooper got assaulted, and how Cairo has become like L.A. in the 1980s but minus skateboarding and plus decades of religious oppression.,While many think the “Jasmine Revolution” of Tunisia is to blame for the radical protests in Egypt, there is a much simpler explanation: geology. Yes, I know, it may seem like a simplistic way to summarize complex socioeconomic factors that have been building in the Middle East since the power vacuum formed after the fall of the Soviet Union, but actually it makes a lot of sense. So what exactly is the geological basis for insurrections? How can dirt and rocks affect revolutionary thought? And what exactly does this mean for San Francisco?,Geology is both an active and a static area. On one hand there is the physical earth that a country is situated on. Imagine a slice of cake with funfetti (diamonds! oil!), chocolate frosting (iron! gold!), and lots of cake in between (pound, angel, devil food, it all works as a rock porosity metaphor). Think of a country as one of those pieces of edible paper that people put on the top of sheet cakes, not really part of the cake, not really signifying anything about the kind of cake below, and just kind of a weird overlay.,On the other hand there are the geologic processes that affect the county, that modify its initial cake state, like melting ice cream on it (subduction of tectonic plates anyone?) or lighting a candle (magma hot spots) or smooshing it into your brother’s face when he least expects it (an apt description of the distortion that occurs during both strike and slip faults as well as earthquake aftershocks).,Like a good party, the geology of a country depends on both having the cake and eating it too, and revolutions are inspired both by the economics of geological phenomena like diamonds and oil as well as destabilizing events like earthquakes. Other manifestations of plate tectonics, like the mountain building in the Tibetan plateau due to the subduction of the Indian plate, can also create environments conducive to guerilla warfare. Consider the sheer number of potential caves and crags Osama Bin Laden could be hiding in. Groups like the Taliban use the geography caused by geology to enable the anonymous and unpredictable tactics of their insurrection.,Meanwhile in Egypt, there are three layers of rocks. First, there is a lovely layer of limestone that covers most of the country’s surface. This explains the color (or lack thereof) of the pyramids. It’s also nice, soft sedimentary stone that’s dissolvable with acid, so if things get too rough one can just douse the country and everything will melt. Seriously—the calcium that holds the stone together will dissolve away as quickly as Mubarak’s international support.,Below the limestone is a layer of sandstone. That is pretty self-explanatory. Underlying this a layer of metamorphic and igneous rocks, where iron, gold, and reserves can also be found. Besides that proverbial funfetti and frosting, Egypt doesn’t have much going on in terms of geologic activity because it is located in the middle of the African plate. The Arabian plate that is its next door neighbor sometimes gets uppity, resulting in earthquakes like 1992’s 5.8 that killed 552, but most of the geologic excitement comes from the secondary effects of its natural resources.,The wealth gap in the country (partially caused by the control of the mining and oil industries by a handful of Mubarak cronies), the international corporate interest in maintaining stability to ensure uninhibited access to drilling and extraction, and the pretty damn depressing repetition of sandstone as the only building material—bland and passé and very 1960 (B.C.E)—all helped contribute to the mass protests and Twitter-powered revolution.,Geology is often forgotten when looking at international events but it actually and literally fuels revolution from oil to caves and from blood diamonds to the stones the slaves built the pyramids with. California is also its fault.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/layer-cake/,"

"__The Filson Tote__,Handsome, water-resistant, and sporty–with ample space for your binoculars, bullets, and Kiehl’s sunscreen–Filson’s totes and field bags represent the paragon of utility and function when hunting, shooting and fly-fishing. But let’s be honest now. We’re at Princeton…is there any real reason to carry around a Filson bag? Is there some member-only hunting moor behind Cottage? Didn’t think so. Then why do so many Princeton ladies carry around Filson bags? Because Filson bags seem to project an image of health and preppy athleticism. Done in rugged twill and aged leather, Filson’s bags evoke georgic images of driving a vintage Range Rover through Wyoming wilderness to grouse hunt and fly-fish at your family’s Jackson Hole haunt. The girl who wields a Fil- son bag wants the world to know that somehow, underneath her Tibi-Tory Burch-Ralph Lauren exterior, she shops at Or- vis and Cabela’s and is somewhat connected to the earth…be it in reality or solely in fantasy.,__The Louis Vuitton Neverfull__,As a kid, I always thought that the Louis Vuitton Neverfull was the weird storage unit that the mothers of my Per- sian friends used to carry their Pomeranians and miniature poodles. Because of this, I developed a mental correlation between middle-aged Persian women and the Neverfull. Then, I come to Princeton, and the Turkish girl in my hallway carries one, furthering cementing my mental image of the Neverfull as the preferred handbag of wealthy Middle Easterners.,__The Goyard St. Louis PM__,There is a certain je ne sais quoi about a girl who wields a Goyard tote, or at least she certainly hopes that you think there is. I’m not quite sure whether the je ne sais quois comes from the mystifying powers of Goyard’s obscure tesselation- like print, or from wondering why in the world the girl spent $1040 on an unlined canvas sack with straps that look like they’d break at any given moment. The Goyard’s shape and material recall that of the Louis Vuitton Neverfull…so much so that I once heard a woman remark, about a friend’s, “Why that girl be wearin’ a bootleg Lewy V.” Perhaps that’s the appeal: Goyard’s obscurity and price premium over more conventional Louis Vuitton bags bring it quiet cachet. Sure a Goyard toter can carry a Louis Vuitton bag, but she’s likely such a self-perceived bastion of good taste that she considers the Louis Vuitton monogram too prole, too plebeian, too pedestrian.,__The Longchamp Pliage__,Nylon with a cavernous interior and easily collapsible, Lon- champ’s Le Pliage is utility at its finest, and because of this, is perhaps the most commonly seen bag on campus. Freshman year, I remember hearing an acquaintance of mine say that she wanted one really badly so that she could be preppier and fit in with other Princeton girls. Of course, when every Princ- eton girl thinks this, everyone ends up owning one, or two, or three. For some girls, the Pliage is the item that brings them one step closer to living their dream of being a teen- age girl living on the Upper East Side and going to school at the Constance Billard School for Girls (I don’t watch Gossip Girl, I swear). While it seems like some–particularly those upwardly mobile–treat the Pliage as as a symbol of some nebulous concept of a lifestyle that they aspire toward, others treat it as a large, durable tote that can fit all the accoutre- ments of college life. Essentially, it is whatever: a whatever, large black hole where you put stuff…lots of stuff.,__The Monogrammed L.L. Bean Backpack__,There’s something creepily Lolita-esque and gamine about a girl whose bag of choice is more appropriate for third grader. Is it because she still thinks she’s in third grade and needs her name on her back to remember it’s hers? Probably.,__The Vineyard Vines Tote__,The Vineyard Vines tote, along with the Pliage, is the most commonly seen bag on campus. Because of that, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact stereotype for the girl who carries the Vineyard Vines tote. My friend insists that girls use Vineyard Vines totes to suggest that they are part of a lifestyle cen- tered around living in Connecticut and summering on the namesake Vineyard, but I did not find it compelling. Because standard Vineyard Vines totes are always attached to orga- nizations–be it Pi Phi, the sailing team or the class of 2014,,I think they’re merely a good vehicle for discreetly touting campus affiliations. Because of that, another friend argued that Vineyard Vines toting girls are so insecure, that they feel the need to let everyone know their affiliation. Whether or not that’s the case, I’m not convinced either.,__The Vera Bradley Tote__,With prints evocative of the vomit resulting from a week- long binge of only consuming Skittles, Starbursts, orange juice and Kool-Aid vodka, Vera Bradley bags are another item seen commonly around campus, most often in the form of prox wallets. Prox wallets are one thing, but even Fargo Lady’s Wear Monthly would have a hard time deeming a full set of matching Vera Bradley bags and luggage “chic.” Yet one parochial Princeton girl I know seems to think that a full Vera Bradley luggage set represents the pinnacle of style. You know, the kind of girl who hails from a declining Midwestern city, but blabs nonstop about how it’s comparable to New York City, and how great its culture is, and how stylish she is because she has a seven piece Vera Bradley luggage set blah blah blah? But who is she kidding? Vera Bradley luggage sets are only appropriate for two demographics: middle school girls (the kind who decorate their lockers with locker chan- deliers and locker wallpaper and lime green locker carpeting) and adorable old ladies.,__The Feed Bag__,The Feed Bag is part of a project started by Princeton alum and former Ivy Club member Lauren Bush Lauren, the niece of George W and daughter-in-law of Ralph Lauren. Feed promises to feed one malnourished child for an entire year, from the proceeds for each sold bag. While the purpose seems noble, all of the Feed Bag-toting girls I’ve encoun- tered have been very self-righteous about their bags. You know the type who let’s everyone know “Like I can totally be carrying a Coach bag but like they’re made out of unsus- tainable leather and like I want to feed orphans and stuff.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/excess-baggage-2/,"

"I love Christmas. I love eating nothing but tamales and holiday cookies for two weeks. I love getting shit from my relatives that I myself am too broke to buy. I love seeing family and friends. I love being home. I love Christmas songs and Christmas specials on ABC family. And I love the movie Elf. Christmas is probably the thing I look forward to the most every year.,But being at Princeton, it can be a little difficult appreciating these things, or at the very least remembering the holiday season is upon us. I didn’t even realize it was December until I had to save something on my computer and I noticed the date read “December 5.” Were it not for that and the peppermint mocha at Starbucks, I don’t know that I’d ever really recognize Christmas’s arrival. ,It’s interesting the way everyone talks about the Orange Bubble, usually referring to the way we lose contact with the outside world in terms of global events, or really anything that doesn’t directly affect our busy schedules. I’ve believed for some time now that if the sky were falling most of us would never realize it because we were studying or at an info session or running a meeting or some other very Princeton-ish activity. But I’d never thought about it in terms of something like this (i.e. Christmas time). ,A fellow writer for the Nassau Weekly suggested that someone go shopping out in the real world and relate back to us what the experience was like, and I really do think it would be a strange experience. It’s been two years now since I did any Christmas shopping in an actual store (and not on the internet), but I remember the winter decorations and massive sales and assaulting signs everywhere advertising special holiday edition this or that with either a cute polar bear or a ridiculously good-looking family laughing at some unknown inside joke. Now I find I’m not only oblivious of what the joke is, but completely unaware the joke even exists. ,I was in Boston this Thanksgiving and during my time there I noticed some stores were already getting ready for the coming month. I know this is typical, but it was surprising nonetheless. Perhaps more jarring than the sudden transition into the holiday season was the equally sudden transition out of it. The minute I stepped on campus I immediately forgot Christmas was just around the corner. I immediately submerged myself in work yet again—work I neglected over break, work I had to get done before the next break (though even the thought of another break was slightly confusing to process). I immediately lost the nostalgia that had briefly surfaced when I was in Massachusetts. For that short time I had gone back to my pre-Princeton years when I would watch holiday movies every weekend and drink Mexican hot chocolate with pan dulce and literally just sit and watch my Christmas tree, intently. But I don’t have time for nostalgia. I have work to do. Princeton makes sure to remind me of this while, outside the Bubble, department stores and television programs are doing their best to remind people of the opposite, to remind them that the holidays have arrived and soon kids will be out of school and parents will be on vacation and families will gather yet again to gossip and annoy each other the way only families can. ,Princeton seems to change the way we experience pretty much everything. The “bubble” is quintessentially Princeton. Our detachment from everything is unique. What this says about us as people I’m not entirely sure. I’m just angry because I want to drag out this whole Christmas thing for as long as I possibly can, but Princeton makes it really hard for me to do so.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/tis-not-season/,"

"I knew coming into Princeton that self-confidence would be essential to my survival and my sanity. Having confidence would allow me to start taking risks and not be afraid of failure, to develop courage and resilience, to learn how to adjust. The new college environment, in which there is so little structure, would require an understanding of my both my limits and capabilities. In order to feel fulfilled socially and academically, I could no longer sit back and let life take its course: I had to challenge, orient, and sustain myself. This meant that once at Princeton, I had to push myself outside of my comfort zone and accept both the good and bad consequences of taking risks, or I else would face being left behind, stagnant instead of thriving. ,Now, almost a semester done, while my academic situation could improve, it is not the most pressing or shocking issue. What took me by surprise was my difficulty adjusting socially: I lacked the courage and confidence to put myself out there, and in turn, was left feeling inept and lacking a sense of connection with others on campus. The social and the academic are much more fluid here: I live where I work. There is no retreating to my home at the end of a school day and hiding out. I have to face my classmates all the time; an adjustment as I did not go to a boarding school. I am not misanthropic but I certainly do not do well with copious amounts of people all the time. So I found ways to retreat, especially during frosh week, which was essentially a five-day meet-people festival— something I, an awkward and socially un-suave girl, could not handle all that well. Because I had formed a very solid group of close friends in high school and had a familial bond with them, it was difficult being essentially friendless. Around those friends, I was able to be completely myself and therefore grew comfortable with the quirky, socially awkward, slightly outrageous person that I am. Yet here at Princeton that group was lacking: I had to start all over again, and I was being cowardly about opening up, offering parts of me, and feeling vulnerable to others’ judgment. ,So what happened to me, too afraid to put effort into meeting people and sharing myself, was that I turned into a bit of a recluse those first few weeks. Which was silly: of course I’d feel lonely and isolated if I separated myself from the rest of the humans. My insecurities about not making friends, connecting to people, or being seen as really weird were only heightened in all that alone time I spent focusing on the negative. ,When I did decide to stop self-pitying and go and meet people, I was frustrated because though I met people, everything seemed superficial to me. I felt as if no one really wanted to get to know me beyond the general, impersonal small talk and chit-chat you have with everyone. Even when I made efforts to develop deeper relationships with people, I definitely felt awkward doing so, as if I were breaching some line and was too eager to be friends with people. Instead of realizing that the key was time and that, yes, I had to take risks and be rejected by folks, I retreated once more and developed a ridiculous me versus them complex in which I felt like the problem was with everyone else and not me (not true, my dear Princetonians!),A large factor into my feeling that the campus culture was causing my problems is that I do not go out that much. This isn’t because of some deep-seated moral objection—I am all for the rest of the world going out, but I personally am not a fan of large crowds, unless I am with people I really trust and care for (and so far I am lacking in that department) to make it feel more intimate. I did not have any of those people here, so I did not bother going out (plus, I had enough sense to realize that my super awkward freshman self would exponentially up my super awkward freshman qualities if I got dolled up and went to the Street alone). Since I perceived the Street as an essential part of the social scene here, I certainly felt as though I was not integrated into the social scene at all. Isolation was calling my name once again. Yet, upon talking to the few freshmen acquaintances I had made who did go out and drink, a theme started to occur: people drank to loosen up, to have fun, to feel less self-conscious. They said they felt too awkward without some alchy in their systems.  Which is understandable, because, of course, no one likes being awkward (except for maybe me). But I think this is because there is a giant stigma against awkwardness. And if people felt too awkward to socialize without alcohol, did this mean that who they were—their personalities—were just awkward? Were they avoiding being their awkward selves because they felt our campus culture would be unaccepting of it or because they simply disliked that aspect of themselves? I’m not sure of the answers and it’s hard for me to figure them out because I know I’m (wonderfully) awkward and have come to terms with it. Yet, despite my own acceptance of my awkwardness and imperfections, I still feel that there is no social culture on campus in which students of all types interact and really get to learn from each other. In this sense, the Orange Bubble becomes a bit stifling, limiting opportunities for people to explore the uniqueness in their peers and instead placing a high emphasis on our commonalities rather than differences. I seek a social environment that is culturally engaging while still fun, one that allows me to learn about and appreciate others’ differences but also to dig deeper and see, that despite however dissimilar our backgrounds may be, underneath it all we are really the same, struggling with developing our identity and surviving in a culture that pushes for perfection and conformity.,I feel alone because I feel like the person who I am, the person who I identify with the most, has not found her counterparts here yet. So when I take the risk of letting go of as much of my self-consciousness as I can and start being myself, I’m happy but I still feel lonely; I still feel unconnected to the campus at large. I am a pretty open person and am willing to share how I feel with others. I am not too ashamed of my feelings and like to discuss them with others, to see if I am on par with them or if I have an issue I need to tackle with myself. Yet I have yet to find people who are comfortable doing the same with me, so in the mean time, I feel alone and strange. ,Earlier in the year, I was resentful because of that me versus them complex. But after being judgmental and frustrated for a few months, I’ve come to realize that with time I will come into myself and I’ll be entirely happy. I will find the people that care about me (relationships take time to develop; I forgot that as I’ve had the comfort of being close friends with people for several years) and that accept me for exactly who I am, for the person that I love and want to share. Patience is the key word, and it’s something I have with adorable small children, but oddly enough not with people of my own age. I still need time to grow—I may think I’m mature, but a lack of patience is a sign of immaturity—by myself and along with my peers here. So I will continue to reflect on how my social life is evolving—how I fit into this Orange Bubble—and hope that people begin to find themselves, piece by piece. One by one everything will fall together and connections will be made and solidified. It’s no fun to wait, but as I reflect and grow I realize that no one is really that superficial—it just takes time to admit our ‘weaknesses’, our loneliness, our frustration, and thus, it takes time to connect. It is okay to be upset, unsatisfied, and emotional. I believe that is what makes us human, that is what makes our lives so intricate and complex and exciting to live. I acknowledge that I have a raw aspect to myself, an irrational side that needs expressing. If we all admit that there is something about us that is imperfect, whether it be that we are awkward, or lonely, or disappointed in ourselves, it becomes less of a “problem” and more of a regular aspect of life. It’ll bring us together and make the Orange Bubble feel a little less surreal. While I wait for this to happen, I take joy in the times when I do have a conversation that brings me closer to someone; that makes me realize how much in common we all have. I smile and feel at peace, knowing that more and more of these connections will be made and soon I will feel whole.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/drifting-bubble/,"

"Said America:,_I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps,,They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;,I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:,His day is marching on._,Said Maimonides:		,_Inspired Actions,Inspired Words_,1.,Around the tenth anniversary of 9/11, the New Yorker ran a series of short interviews with its staff writers. One of the questions was: “What piece of work to emerge from 9/11 […] has stayed with you the most?” America was born anew that day, its whole cultural flesh remade of smoldering ruins; most we know emerged from the smoke that rose from Lower Manhattan, so emerge is difficult. But it is also liberating. The writers offered answers as filial as Junod’s “Falling Man” and as far-away as Bon Jovi.,I wondered what my answer was. The Dirty Projectors’ Getty Address, an allegorical unfolding of the country’s post-9/11 decline through Don Henley’s centrifugal continental wanderings, wended toward it, purveying spiritual critiques for the era resonant with mine. But it didn’t stay with me as the attacks’ have stayed with all of us or capture all the feelings we’ve submerged: the shock, the helplessness, the anger and pain, the hopelessness, the despair, the hope. This is darkness, but to experience them in art is to be comforted: somebody out there is going through it and knows how you feel. That is why these works are important—as quivering hands.,2.,“I’ll nominate, obliquely, the 2006 TV on the Radio album Return to Cookie Mountain, which somehow maps onto the mood of the Global War on Terror period for me”, Nicolas Lemann said.  It felt how he felt. How did he feel? His response to a different question—which single image most still remains—is poetically revealing: “across the meadows of northern New Jersey, two tall gray columns of smoke rising from lower Manhattan, just where the two towers had been.” The shapes he describes reveal the lineaments of the landscape of his heart. In his ears, Cookie Mountain takes that form. Would it in mine? In mind?,3.,“Maps onto the mood” estranges at first, as maps of the world first surprise. The atlas’ cartographic abstraction quickly softens into one’s reasoning mind, where lines make sense as mountains and deep blue as ocean. Lemann’s claim that music can attain cartographic qualities—that Cookie Mountain had—on a map not geographical but emotional, intrigues. This is the conceit of Justin Vernon’s recent album: each song takes its name from a place and impresses the connotative feeling of it, a play on I’m in a good place now. It also recalls Dave Longstreth’s liner notes to the Getty Address, which give papery flesh to the songs’ terse narrative. In one scene, Sacagawea tours Don Henley, the hero, around Gettysburg: “As she leads him around the battlefield, Henley believes they are walking across his own body, and that Sacagawea is unfolding them on a map of his life. All the skirmish sites, all the places where cannons have scarred the hillsides: each is one of his memories.” ,Moods are historical, located in time when originated and later summoned. Moods are maps, consuming, extending through the body and body politic, ecologically variegated—forested, frozen over, bedazzled by birds and brooks that lean seawards where they find expression. They show society and each person’s relation to it, ever-changed by both. Epochal moods, the ones rumbling during the “Global War on Terror”, containing eternity but marvelously contingent—in that way not desire, but desire for something, and love, too—change slow enough for art to image them while they last. Works of art, like trees watered by streams and seen from the foothills, bloom from a few square feet—a studio, a mind, an eviscerated city block—into states and minds. In this way is cartographic music to its listeners an object both of solidarity (we are all Americans) and revelation (someone else feels the way I do). ,4.,Dear Science, after Cookie Mountain, is moody but deeply interior, no longer cartographic. It doesn’t ride the cresting optimism that had Obama elected a few months later—a misread that had the album top year-end lists. Rather, it enters an after symbolized by his election that exists in the before (the war, President Bush) and that has only moved on by accepting the before’s inevitability. Because the societal after is necessarily a lie, as the War proceeds out of mind, it turns from Cookie Mountain’s mapping to the fate of the individual in this swirl. There is no cartography because there is no public.,Bleakly, the end of these days rests in the lost souls whose only savior is ignorance. This is not true salvation. The chorus of “Golden Age” announces that such an age “is coming around”. What gives the illusion of optimism is the brief suppression of despair by dance: “and all this violence and all this goes away”. It fades as the dance intensifies. In the beginning, the dancers know their “soul is [not] free”; in the end, they think it is. The dance acts as opiate and convinces the dancers to accept their imprisonment. “Joy resounding” comes to the hall where “violence” continues unbridled but unthought. ,This is pleasure outside of history. It is so intense that it is no longer outside of history. It is it. We have erected a false tradition of individualism that rejects any actual tradition. We follow catastrophe with catastrophe, because this moment is “beyond history”, because it “calls for it”. We fight wars far from our shores and go so far from ourselves. Having loosed our moorings, we are lost at sea. ,5.,Dear Science attacks the “death professor”, an “angry young mannequin”. Social speech is considered vain, bothersome. It’s not against rationalism per se but the possibilities of public reasoning to elevate the situation. It leaves its predecessor’s town squares and street corners and retreats to the bedroom. Whether it advocates or only perceives is unclear. There’s “Lover’s Day”, quite brashly distanced from any social descent: “I’m gonna take you, I’m gonna shake you, I’m gonna make you cum”. The lover wants only pleasure; it’s all he can hope to get. ,6.,In Dear Science’s world, resonant with ours, little can be done to halt socio-political decay, so the people turn from the public towards private pleasures, narcissistic, nihilistic, but happy. Those private pleasures might have built toward political reconstruction, but retreating seems to only intensify social decay. Selfishness, justified by social impotence, withering self and public.  This is smug post-war, post-partisanship, post-racism. Dear Science is post-war in war, losing the historical conflict and sense of public justice that impel Cookie Mountain. Politics come unhinged, paranoid. ,Science recognizes this, but its knowledge is not helpful. It’s disturbing, sending us towards the last redoubt of joy while telling us that place is terrible. Where it maps, that mood has no light which is not sickeningly fluorescent. There are no prophets—only lovers and dancers and friends. It is nihilistic, rending itself into nothing. There is no Messianic light to lead us through the “narrow gates”, no hope for transmission. It is beautiful, though.  ,7.,Comparing Nine Types of Light’s cover art with its two predecessors’ is revealing: in 2006, a bloody wreath; in 2008, the name of a show illumined on a marquee; in 2011, red light caroming in space. The band’s departure is clear. And where from? Return to Cookie Mountain responds prophetically to terror and loss. It does so so powerfully. Speaking darker than ash, it nonetheless hopes— for reassurance by wisdom through transmission and by history through remembrance—a battle hymn for the republic. ,Science’s two best songs lose Cookie Mountain’s prophecy but resurrect it allegorically. Allegories carry messages but they are not expressly political because they are not express. They ask for millions of interpretations and not a single response. “Family Tree” is a true love song—it sustains the not-loving aspects of love—chiming, calling “my love” (she wakes up to the cool light, “the day calls in billows”). But these lovers end “hanging on the shadow of [her] family tree”. They’re hung on an old idea, which is the story of Icarus, like the “Falling Man”, tumbling from the towers, fleeing death, unsure, in search of freedom. He is not forlorn by his fate. ,“Stork & Owl” is Dear Science’s other excellent song. There’s dance here, but it’s a “faceless fall”. Two birds watch, and it seems they have taken up the band’s prophecy; it has been displaced into them. They ask, “what’s this dying for?” (It is for love.) They sing: “death’s a door / that love walks through”. (This is how it’s always been.) They guide the falling through his fall: “turn from the fear / of the storms that might be”. There are lessons in both songs, but they’re personal and not apparently epochal, not particularly suited to the terror we feel. We aren’t called to listen. ,8.,What were the storms of 2006? Five years of war and Homeland Security; fear on high, and (so) Bush reelected; the bubble bursting.  Malaise—the band’s elegant “ennui unbridled”—setting in. Two years have been lost. Cookie Mountain’s mapping music is both apocalyptic in the face of terror and reassuring nonetheless; the nation’s decline is still new, seemingly stoppable.  Sung by the prophet, blinded by the debris, from an impossible place to a still-possible audience assembled—the American people. It says walk forward and holds our hands. This is what we want to hear. ,9.,There are four aspects of this prophetic process: recognizing despair; being (divinely, historically) inspired to counter it; announcing that inspiration; and conveying it in the form of instruction.  (The Biblical cycle is: sin, prophecy, redemption, sin again.) The band is worried about the world. “I Was a Lover” refers explicitly to the American situation, referring to a love “before this war” and contrasts “Dancing Choose”, describing “sleepwalking” that’s not accepted but “is really a crime”. In  “Method”, there’s a “storm faced cloud”—like the smoke and soot, falling—“hanging in dystrophy”—like the warped metal, melting. The America the album witnesses is carnaged, disastered, peopled by traumatized bodies, but not safe. The real storm, worsened by the country’s response, is coming. An ominous drone is the backdrop throughout—throbbing, anxious, building still.,10.,The Bible joins societal destruction and prophetic revelation: both come down from God, the latter in the midst of the former, seeking its end. Apocalypse and revelation are twinned. Mount Sinai, where the Law was given, is often a volcano: lightening, thunder, great fires on its summit. Our culture also understands prophets who are “possessed” or “chosen”. Prophetic inspiration is fundamentally violent—to be chosen by God is so traumatic—and in this way akin to the chaos it combats. Cookie Mountain figures this in its selective use of the personal pronoun (far from the retreated “I” in Science) and the two vocalists’ performance. It is only an “I” because it has been vested with an especial power; it represents their prophecy. “Wolf Like Me” shows this most prominently. Prophet as werewolf reveals the act’s ritual, cyclical, and historical nature. “Got a curse I cannot lift”: the curse of the prophet, destined to preach, destined to surrender, to be apart from the community he hopes to save. His “mind’s aflame” from God’s word coming through. He opens his “heart and let[s] it bleed onto yours.” ,Its performance is telling. Like “I Was  Lover”, “Province”, and “Method” it begins with an invocation, a preverbal niggun, distended o. This is the band’s signature convocation, singing to an audience whose attention is needed. Tunde’s singing is self-completing, spastic with the drums; he closes his eyes, writhes across the stage; his left arm reaches before him all the while, hand open, hitting the air like a preacher, writhing sometimes, too, fighting to get words off chest; he’s always looking up. His timing with the music is sensual, the violence of his prophecy attuned to the despair in the music and at the same time against it, splitting the drone. Kyp’s prophecy is quite different. He is round-bodied, round-bearded; Tunde is lanky, loose. Kyp stands completely still, his eyes rolled back, his mouth’s motion barely visible in those curls, singing carefully. His voice vacillates between highs and lows, refined, haunting. He is entranced, channeling. Their voices and appearance structure the prophetic dualisms of master and mystic, ecstasy and trance, howl and hum. The relationship of end-times and revelation in prophecy is here evident, between voice and voice and voice and music. When one howls the other must hum, and Return to Cookie Mountain demonstrates the prophetic aspect of this relation and the prophet’s perspective on and in the end-times. The way they sing makes as much clear. ,Return to Cookie Mountain’s greatest innovation is where they sing from—a place of wisdom beyond the human, of Earth’s molten core, the cumulous heavens. Their wisdom—of how to live and what is right—is known only to God and ancient, mystical traditions. They’ve tapped into it to guide us in this rupture.  Most of the past decade’s musical output seems to be typified by a withering self-consciousness. That’s totally fine, but it hardly helps. The perspective of “Blues from Down Here” is absolute, gone, wise: “You might doubt it, / think there’s nothing left for me to do/ but stomp my feet /and shout about it”. From down where? From the deepest depths at which being heard on the surface is still possible, far enough from the carnage to see the world in a divine light but close enough to illuminate it for us. From frustrating depths, where prophecy like Moses’ might be doubted. But to doubt is to have heard, and transmission is paramount. Tunde and Kyp attain this liminal voice right here, in the rubble of September 12th. In history, that is, they ascend; to change it, they return. ,11.,There is something beautiful about their voices coming through drone, from the disaster zone where they sing. It is a matter of contrast and survival. Their voices are not lights in a dark room, illuminating cleanly. No—their songs are strewn with murmurs and gasps and illegible rhymes. No—it’s more like the beacon of a lighthouse slung through a thick fog to signal the coming of land. The boat is hardly visible; the land cannot be seen. But the thin light coming through does come through and bespeaks.,12.,There is something so beautiful about teaching. “Lessen your desire”, they sing. You do, because it is sung with the appropriate tenderness and urgency, and because this teaching is what you wanted. It is so rare these days to be told what to do, what is right, but it’s wonderful. Isn’t it? Someone in this mess knows something and cares enough to tell us about it—believes enough that we’ll listen. And what they’re telling us is to stop listening to the false prophets, to calm down, to proceed steadily, readily. ,That is the essence of Cookie Mountain’s mapping. Only a prophetic self-distancing can allow them to see the ravished landscape and its past. In its most beautiful, reassuring moments, they return to give us the Ten Commandments for our fractured epoch. Because they are apart, they are not corrupted by fear. “Province” is redemptive: “Hold your heart courageously / as we walk into this dark place. / Stand, steadfast, erect, and see / that love is the province of the brave”; and, later the singular is made plural. “Hold your breath so patiently”.  This wisdom is immanent and pertinent. It counters counter-terrorism and counter-culture. It is serene, self-assured.,13.,Benjamin writes that Kafka lived in an era “preparing to do away with the inhabitants of this planet on a considerable scale”. Kafka’s work laments a “sickness of tradition” that allowed for that mood; he seeks to restore “wisdom’s […] haggadic consistency”, against positivistic modernity, to whom the band wrote their not so loving letter, to restore ritual ties not subject to capitalism. Benjamin writes that Kafka “sacrificed truth for the sake of clinging to its transmissibility, its haggadic element”. Kafka had little regard for truth as such, only for its ability to pass down through generations, to escape death. Thus, Benjamin writes—as much of himself, in 1938, Fascism ascendant, two years from death—“there is an infinite amount of hope, but not for us”. He writes: “never lose sight of one thing: it is the purity and beauty of a failure”. ,Benjamin writes of a painting of the Angel of History by Klee. Benjamin writes that the Angel is “irresistibly propelled” by a Paradisal storm “into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward”, product of the “one single catastrophe”—history—“piling ruin upon ruin”.  When we look at the painting, it is facing us, obstructing Eden. Our journey toward Paradise is endless deterioration. Like Kafka, we are decaying into the future. Those among us undeluded by historical progress, aware to the moment’s putrefaction, pursue not an ideal but the transmission of what we have received. All truth is past; all truth we will ever have, we have now; it must be preserved. The “beauty of a failure” is in that preservation. ,14.,The American condition after the attacks is one of profound alienation—from politics, from leaders leaders, from reality, from each other, from that with which we were once intimately familiar and relied on but which changes now, estranges. These things have disappeared. Benjamin writes of Brecht: art’s “truly important thing is to discover the conditions of life. (One might say just as well: to alienate them.)” He wrote in an epoch of alienation, from tradition by science, from others by the city. Recovering the fragments of what has been lost requires their alienation from temporality. This alienation reveals the original alienation and finds historical wisdom. It revolutionarily disrupts modernity to return to an earlier past. ,15.,All prophecy is alienated. Cookie Mountain is. The poetry of alienation is the poetry of the past. The drone is history’s ruin. Their words rediscover transmission. “Province” returns: “All your history’s ablaze / try to breathe / as your world disintegrates / just like autumn leaves”. Even though the past has burnt and rotted away, its memory is salvaged in these songs. Democracy’s ashes, dissipating in that September breeze, are caught and preserved in a jar: how they might teach! “All your memories are / as precious as gold”. They reach backwards (inwards)—where is divine light—as far as they can to grab all the history they can and bring it back. Their prophecy is from back there, down there, out there. The “three volume tome of contemporary slang” they compile on “I Was a Lover” is not contemporary at all; the very notion of a tome to preserve a culture is ancient. The slang’s speakers die into it, like the sages. It’s Haggadic, too: tell your children of what was. There is strength there.,The album wants to communicate at all, and then to communicate strength. Like Israel’s prophets, the wisdom it knows it possesses gives it confidence of being heard. Evil has come; deafness has not, yet. There is a speaker who anticipates a listener and a listener who remembers that speaker and words—like this music—that bind them. In even this desperate epoch, transmission resurrects history. And it is history, memory, tradition that will save not us from terror, but those after who are attuned to the wisdom we pass down. Jewish history describes tradition’s resurrective capacity. The Haggadah has sustained us. These songs are wise past imagining. Their orientation toward the transmission of tradition can become the tradition that steadies us against the Great Terror. If we listen, and tell our children, some light might filter through the “narrow gates”.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/end-times-tunes/,"

"I wanted to get a do-nothing library job, but my dad thought it would be good for me to work with kids as a tutor or a babysitter. He said that it would help my people skills. ,I looked for library jobs and I looked for babysitting jobs but I found neither. Instead I landed a spot as a Recreation Supervisor for Princeton Intramural Sports (IMs).,In some ways the job is like a jail cell. There are few opportunities for advancement (also known as a raise), the hours aren’t always flexible, and people seldom say “Thank you” (except the Colonial teams—they are really nice).,Still, there are times when the job is exactly what I was looking for. It pays, and it’s more interesting than doing homework. Also, I get extreme pleasure from sorting through the names of the various players who have signed in to play and assigning names to previously anonymous faces that I’ve seen around campus. Sometimes when no one is watching, I stalk the players on Facebook. ,Working intramural games isn’t quite the people-skills lesson my dad wanted me to have, but it has taught me a lot about people. From my perch above the dodgeball courts, or through the scorer’s box window at Baker Rink, I can watch all sorts of people locked in friendly athletic competition. And sometimes all it takes is a friendly competition for people to show who they truly are.,The rest of this article will basically be a long tirade against one particular class of people that I despise categorically. ,Seriously, if you play IMs, or if you know someone who does they’ll confirm. They are actually the worst. I’m talking, of course, about graduate students. Let me first enumerate the ten things I hate most about graduate students (in no particular order), and then let me attempt to explain why they are the way they are.,Why Grad Students Suck,1. They wear knee pads and elbow pads to play broomball.,
2. They complain if you show up late to your shift.,
3. They complain if their opponents show up late to their games.,
4. They complain if their opponents don’t have the proper gender balance.,
5. Sometimes they agree to forgo the gender balance rule to be nice to their opponents, then they complain after the fact if they lose.,
6. They make annoying criticisms about things I can’t control.,
7. They make annoying criticisms about things I can’t control, but they phrase it in the form of a question. For example: “Does it really count as a hit if the blocker drops the ball they block with?” or “Is the wall really out of play?”,
8. They scout the opposition.,
9. They stay after games to practice.,
10. They never forfeit (I get to go home if they forfeit).,The question is: what accounts for the high concentration of douchebags on graduate school IM teams? I would like to propose a model to answer this question.,The process, I think, is analogous to the process of selection in nature.,In nature, there are certain traits that give an individual an advantage in reproducing, so those traits become more prevalent in the next generation. Similarly in academia, certain traits are selected for with each successive round of schooling. ,When considering applicants to private elementary schools teachers consider a child’s communication skills and sharing skills. At the best private high schools, educators look for motivated students with a pension for hard work. In the next round, the best universities select for future leaders in government and industry.,
As far as I can tell graduate school applications may well consist of only a stool sample, because graduate schools select exclusively for those individuals with the best smelling shit. Actually, I think that’s highly unlikely. But I’m quite sure that there is a question on the application that reads: “What do you think your shit smells like?” and the highest scored responses are typically “Like roses,” or “Like fresh-baked croissants.”,
Graduate students are an interesting breed. They are the ones who since their first day of kindergarten have been told that they are better than their peers. They’re well practiced at all the things that let them stand out in the eyes of their teachers—the subtle self-promotion, the thank-you-sir-can-I-have-another attitude, the off-handed comment that restates an entire conversation in one sentence, without actually adding any new information.,By the time they actually get to graduate school, grad students are awash in self-pity because their youth is slowly wasting away. Maybe they’re balding. Or worse, maybe they’re married. Maybe their friends all went to Wall Street and they post pictures on Facebook of the super chic clubs they take their clients to. Whatever the reason, graduate students are consumed with a desire to do something to help them feel young.,
The solution: sign up for intramural sports. It’s a great way to keep the old knees moving and to meet hip young underclassmen. But, with their being graduate students and all, they inevitably try to apply their graduate-student-social-awkwardness-and-unwarranted-seriousness to friendly competition, and they end up acting like prepubescent boys playing co-ed pickup basketball. Even the girls act like prepubescent boys playing co-ed pickup basketball. Don’t ask me why, but they do.,They take things way too seriously, and it pisses me off.,I hope by this point you all feel slightly better informed about one of the biggest problems in the Princeton University community. I don’t mean to sway you to my way of thinking, merely to warn you about the possible dangers of associating with that other class of student here at Princeton. If any of you have had a good experience with graduate students, then please disregard everything you’ve just read. If any of you have had no experience at all with graduate students, please take this tirade as an admonishment, and avoid all contact with grad students in the future.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/simmer-down/,"

"I rolled out of bed and into the shower to erase the stench of State Night that still lived on my skin and in my hair and in my blue jeans, which I had forgotten to take off before lying down to sleep the night before.,In the shower I opened my mouth to the spigot and filled it with the warm water. I swallowed, an attempt to drown my hangover. I still can’t think in long sentences.,The thing that stirred me—the thing that pulled me out of bed and into the shower—was the same thing that pulled me back to my room, and pulled my fresh blue jeans up my legs and it was the same thing that tied my shoes.,The thing that stirred me was breakfast pizza at Teresa’s Caffe in Palmer Square. ,Last Sunday Teresa’s opened her doors for fifty students for a five-dollar breakfast pizza feast-a-palooza. Teresa’s threw the event for Princeton’s chapter of Slow Food, a national group organized to support restaurants that serve local food. For Teresa’s it was cheap advertising for their new brunch menu replete with breakfast pizzas and egg creations and even “organic brown egg frittata,” whatever that is.,Before you go rolling your eyes (“What’s so special? Eggs are eggs?”), let me quote from their menu: ,“Crepes, Scallions, Ricotta Salata, Smoked Salmon, Soft Scramble Egg, Béchamel… Poached Eggs, Shitake Mushroom, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmesan Bread, Mornay Sauce… Poached Organic Brown Egg, Spicy Pepperonata Sauce, Smoked Mozzarella, Pane Tostato”,Now, I know Howard up in Mathey makes a mean omelet, but you can’t tell me that you didn’t get a little hot and bothered when you read “Mornay Sauce.” ,But I didn’t go for the eggs, and this story isn’t about the eggs. This story is about the pizza. ,Remember: when I walked into Teresa’s that morning my head was throbbing. I wore sunglasses to hide my drooping eyelids from the judgmental passers-by who were coming from church, or going to church, or doing something at their church. I made my friend Walter come along, so it didn’t look like I—on top of being hungover (and therefore pathetic)—was friendless (and therefore pathetic).,I sat down and let the waiter fill my water glass and bring me bread and bring me pizza. There was no menu that morning. The chef sent us whatever he wanted.,From where I was sitting in the back half of the restaurant with my back to the window, I had a full view of the pizza station and oven in Teresa’s kitchen. I watched the chef pound a ball of dough into a thick disk that reminded me of a red blood cell. Then he tossed it three—maybe four—times, and each time it spread itself a wider and made itself a little thinner. I imagined the dough disk jumping over a garden fence to steal a peak at its neighbors, except it was stealing a peak at its final resting piece in my stomach.,When most people hear “Teresa’s,” they think of light lunch pizzas or salads, or foofy organic pastas for dinner. Most people would not think of breakfast pizzas. And I didn’t really know what to expect when my girlfriend forwarded an invitation to the event to me from the Slow Food listserv. I certainly didn’t expect a thin Italian-style curst to come loaded with a prosciutto, tomato and Fontina cheese omelet, and I definitely had no way to prepare for the organic brown fried egg that spilled its yolk over the gentle mushroom-speckled surface of a Fontina cheese pizza with a tomato sauce base (The chef had a weird affinity for Fontina).,Don’t let the fact that it was packaged as a breakfast pizza fool you—this wasn’t your typical overly-cheesy, overly-greasy Papa Johns pie served with dipping butter and a pepper. Teresa’s prides itself on fresh, organic ingredients and extremely professional preparation and service.,While we filled ourselves up on fresh olive oil and bread from their affiliated bakery—the Witherspoon Bread Company—the pizza chef shot glances at us when the server brought our pizzas over. He seemed anxious to judge by our faces our first impressions of his pies. As we sampled each pizza he kept us in the corner of his eye, always judging the pizza’s reception and thinking about his next creation.,Every pizza wan an improvisation for the chef. He set the menu as he spread the sauce, or scrambled the eggs. He worked as if there was no forethought, only instinct guiding his choice of cheeses and meats and vegetables. When the door to the oven opened and the baker reached in with his long wooden spoon to retrieve the next creation the chef looked as surprised as the customers. Every pizza was an experiment.,I doubt he was scratching his head over how to impress a hungover twenty-year-old. Anything with crispy crust and melted cheese would have done it. But I really was impressed by the way Teresa’s threw together two of my favorite things—breakfast and pizza—which I had previously assumed to be irreconcilable. And best of all, it did it in a non-pretentious way that was accessible to even me, a drunken college student who can’t tell a chantrelle mushroom from a cherry tomato.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/teresas-pizzas/,"

"I usually don’t even bother. Just a quick glance at the flyers while passing by. But for some reason, a nondescript black and white flyer—your ordinary sheet of paper—stood out to me. It would prove itself anything but plain. ,The flyer was for a local salon by Palmer Square—Salon Pure. The advertisement cut straight and to the point: “Get cleaned up for ‘bicker’! 20% off Bikini and Brazilian waxes.” So of course I chuckled, simultaneously amused and disturbed by this surprisingly explicit advertisement. I hadn’t expected this; I had expected the usual—a lecture, a club meeting, a performance. I also wondered why bicker was in quotes. Really, I wanted to know how the salon knew about bicker so intimately and why they had decided to turn a profit on it. Bicker seemed to be something so specific and internal to our culture. It was shocking to see it so blatantly exposed. It was a subculture, or secret, made public, and not just on campus, but in town, outside Princeton, outside the ‘bubble’. ,I was a little anxious about going to meet Salon Pure’s owner, Susan Daly. According to the flyer, she was the lady who, if one wished, could clean a sistah up—how would she take to being interviewed? I felt a bit ridiculous. But I figured if the salon was willing to advertise like this, so odd and forthright, its employees would have no problem with my questions. ,They turned out to be very talkative. When I sauntered up into that salon, the receptionist talked to me as if it was just as normal for some random college freshman to wander about the salon’s advertising strategy as it was as for said freshman to request a wax or hair cut—something actually related to their services. In fact, she was excited that I wanted to know more and was quite keen to talk. She probably figured that my interview would be itself a terrific advertisement, that it would get many a lady to want their pubes removed by Ms. Daly, the owner. ,What follows is a transcription of my conversation with this Daly lady, waxer and manicurist for an astonishing 22-plus years had to say about getting cleaned up for bicker. I have interspersed my own commentary where useful.,Me: How do you know about bicker?,Susan: During all university events, there is always a surge of clientele in Salon Pure. Waxing services are part of their head to toe grooming habits., ,[I like how bicker is of the caliber of a ‘university event’. I wonder what other university events cause everyone to want to abandon the bush.  Perhaps Lawnparties?]  ,Me: Why is this offer specifically for bicker season? What about it could present a need for waxing?,Susan: I have learned, in over 22 years of being a manicurist, pedicurist and waxer, that women like to feel great under their clothing as well as feel good about their outward appearance.,[So perhaps she really doesn’t know why it’s just for bicker. To be fair, I still don’t know why it’s just for bicker, but that’s probably because I am an oblivious frosh.] ,Me: Is the discount only for students bickering or is it open to all university students? ,Susan: The other day, I had a client who is part of a sign in club. I still offered her the discount…..I just felt it was right.,[Oh my. This is an oddly, ridiculously selective discount. This means that all freshmen will have to pay the full $60 for hair removal! Unfair! For frosh on a budget, you better start considering whether you really want to join that sign-in club next year because Salon Pure only wants to offset the cost if you want to bicker. Better reconsider.] ,Me: How have customers, especially Princeton students, liked the waxing services?,Susan: I have gotten great feedback from my clients. They tell me that I provide a less painful service, make them feel very comfortable and give them good maintenance tips.,[At least your hooha will be in great, pain-subduing hands. Like I said, reconsider that sign-in club right now.] ,Me: Has there been an increase in business due to the offer? ,Susan: There is always an increase in business at Salon Pure leading up to events in Princeton in general. I usually see anywhere from 10-20 waxing clients when the eating clubs host events.,[Gotta get your wax on for formals and the like! Mmhmm!] , ,Me: How does the waxing break down by clubs students are bickering for, if known?,Susan: I am not certain of the breakdown per club. However, I do see more clients that are involved in bicker than sign in clubs. ,[Well, girl, you only advertise to those bickering. And you almost didn’t let a sign-in girl get her wax on!] ,Me: Have you had any interesting conversations during a waxing session about a student’s experiences during bicker season? ,Susan: Of course, I have had conversations during waxing sessions about experiences during bicker. I do not mean to imply anything by saying that my clients enjoy my confidentiality. ,[Got it—what happens during waxing stays during waxing. I appreciate her respect. Susan is a woman we can trust not only with our hair follicles but also our intimate social experiences.],Me: What do you enjoy most about your work?,Susan:  “One of the greatest pleasures of my work is meeting young girls from the university. Behind the closed door of Salon Pure’s wax room, I have the opportunity to learn a lot from these girls. I hear about everything from their campus life to thesis work to travels to third world countries where they have offered themselves to care for others.” ,—,As I was about to leave, she said, “feel free to come to the salon and enjoy any of my waxing or manicuring services.” And to that she added, “I’d love to treat me!” Which is nice, but only if for free! ,So although Salon Pure is a bit peculiar and their policy toward who gets a discount and who doesn’t during bicker season is even more strange, it seems as though they are just trying to engage with the university, to learn from us and to provide us with the self-care that we often neglect. Or, maybe, just to make money. , ,Susan herself seems to be an experienced, compassionate waxer, and while one may feel that a quick wax to get ready for bicker is just a part of a healthy beauty regime (and perhaps increasing your chances of getting in), keep in mind that your visits, at least according to Susan, demonstrate that “that Princeton University is successful in turning out some of the most fascinating, intelligent women. My children’s world stands to benefit from it!”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/salon-pure/,"

      Feb 15, 2012    ",Shayla Reid
"We were all born. The act of our creation was one of physical connection: our lives resulted from sex, from something carnal. Because of this, sex is a natural, innate, and healthy part of us that sustains humanity and without it, would lead to our demise. ,Now this may sound a bit odd, as if I’m promoting sex solely for the preservation of the human race. Not the case at all … instead, I want you to consider that no matter how much you deny it, sex happens. It is how we happened. And what is shameful about that our origin, about the physical connection that led us to be? ,From this idea of sex being a natural part of the way humans express themselves—as sexuality is a part of who we are and sex is one of our desires— comes the concept that sex can be a pleasurable activity in and of itself, without any context—that you can engage in sexual activity for the sole sake of wanting to, not because you are hoping to reproduce or because you are in a relationship and that it is expected. Sex positivity celebrates our sexuality as it is, empowering us to be aware of what our desires are and to be in control of how we fulfill them. ,In order to be sex-positive, we should be knowledgeable of how to engage in all kinds of safe, consensual sex in whatever type of relationship you choose. This includes respecting and appreciating various sexual activities: masturbation, abstinence, engaging in only certain sexual activities and refraining from others, being non-monogamous, practicing kink and BDSM, engaging in role play… the possibilities are endless. Sex positivity is an honoring of all that sex is—the emotional aspects, the health aspects, and the desire. It does not mean you have to be very sexually active and it does not mean you’re not allowed to be vanilla (that is, more sexually conservative). Instead, it means that you can be the sexual being you desire to be and that you are comfortable with and empowered by that. It also means that you are open minded about others’ sexual practices, even if they are something you would not engage in yourself. Part of being open-minded means also engaging in honest, open discussion on sex and sexuality. That is essential to sex positivity. ,Some of you might agree with this concept. Some of you may have never heard of sex positivity and are now pondering what it means to you. Some of you don’t agree with this at all. Some of you might be having sex instead of reading this article (well, get it!). Whatever you’re thinking matters. What you believe about sex contributes to the perception of sex in society. And hopefully being open to examining your beliefs on sex because sex positivity makes for healthy relationships and healthy people who are not ashamed of their sexuality.,At Princeton, I feel that sex positivity is often ignored. Either people are unfamiliar with the term, or have never been exposed to the concept. Both institutionally and culturally, I feel that sex positivity could be improved. In order to gain a broader perspective on how people felt about Princeton and sex positivity, I had conversations with two girls: one sophomore, Vivienne Chen, and a junior, Sarah Rounsifer. I had hoped to find more people to talk to (like some menz, and some people not quite in my social circle, to be more balanced), but when I asked a friend to find some people to discuss this issue, he said that no one was willing to talk. Which is a reflection of the culture surrounding sex positivity:  either they did not know what sex positivity was, had no opinion, or were too afraid to voice their thoughts. Despite not finding more folks to discuss the matter with, both Chen and Rounsifer had a good deal to say. You will find their comments interspersed throughout my observations.,Institutionally, Princeton provides us with the basics. While understanding our sexuality is a personal journey that can only be achieved on your own, we need to improve awareness of the resources available on campus that deal with sexuality. While we do have organizations like SHARE, SHA, and a discussion group called Let’s Talk Sex (LeTS), they are only able to do so much and are all focused on different parts of sex positivity. ,I think the most important, as well as the most fitting things the University should impart to students in terms of sexual well-being are the concepts of sexual health and consent. SHARE and SHA focus on these issues, but in a limited way. As Chen, Rounsifer, and I discussed, the University assumes that incoming freshmen all have some basic knowledge of sexual health, which is not always the case. Just within the United States, the differences in sex ed by school, even by teachers within one school, are massive. There are so many disparities: some people may not know much beyond abstinence, and some may know about condoms but not about other contraceptives. Both Rounsifer and Chen mentioned that all of us have to take an AlcoholEdu course but there is equivalent for sex ed. I had not thought of that, and I agree that some sort of mandatory sex ed program would be a great improvement that would increase people’s knowledge on sex and sexuality. While I understand that we are capable of using the Internet to research information on sex ed, it is something most people probably do not bother to do. And while there are resources like SHA and SHARE and RCAs that do discuss sexuality during frosh week, they are limited in their scope. The Sex Jeopardy that SHA organizes is an optional activity. The RCA provides us with free condoms but does not tell us about the process of getting hormonal contraceptives (i.e. birth control). SHARE focuses on consent, especially when it comes to the use of alcohol, which is fitting for a college environment, but I think they could also focus more on negotiating safe, consensual activity within all types of relationships (not just when alcohol is involved) and to continue to reach out to freshmen beyond frosh week. Furthermore, across the board, the sex ed we receive is very much heteronormative, and though the various groups have attempted to address the LGQBT side of things, there is room for improvement. ,Finally, with LeTS, I think they need to be more visible as an organization. There are only two freshmen involved: myself and another girl. The rest of the members I believe are all upperclassmen. The group is pretty small, which makes sense because only a certain set of people would be attracted to it, but I would love if more people joined so that a variety of opinions were represented. LeTS seems to be the one student group on campus that creates a safe space to discuss all aspects of sex positivity, yet it could attempt to attract a larger, more varied membership. With greater membership, it could host more events.  ,Beyond these organizations exists the general culture and attitude towards sex: not what opinions and programs Princeton provides for us, but what we provide for ourselves. As a freshman, I observe some of the sex culture on campus, but because my time here has been so short, part of my perception of it is based on generalizations: there’s a big drunken hook-up scene at the Street and then there are people who are in long-term relationships but no one really does casual dating. For the most part, Chen agreed that at Princeton, our dating scene is different than most colleges as we do not have a lot of opportunities besides the hookup. Rounsifer also says that there is a large hookup culture that usually happens at parties and on the Street, because we are pressed for time and seek to get our fill of partying and sex within the same time period. Beyond that scene, Chen thinks that the people who are in a healthy, casual dating situation or are in a happily committed but open relationship are not as visible on campus; that the weird dominance of the two ends of the spectrums—the hookup culture and the long term relationship one—still persists. There is no middle ground.,I believe part of this dating binary at Princeton exists because so few students are willing to discuss what they actually want and then to act on it. Since we do not discuss what we want for ourselves and what we want to do with each other (ooh!), it never happens. We ignore our sexual desire, diminishing its importance because our academic and career goals take precedence. ,Alcohol is a means for us to finally be able to express our sexual desires without having to take the responsibility for having those desires. It helps us become more comfortable, which is perhaps why sober hookups are rare. Rounsifer, Chen, and I all feel that only being comfortable engaging in sexual activity when using alcohol is not necessarily healthy: one should feel that they can be sexual without the aid of some drank. At the same time, Rounsifer points out sometimes a little alcohol can eventually lead to healthier expression of sexuality—sometimes it is just used to initiate sexual activity and then beyond that push you find yourself happily fulfilling your desires. But of course it is tricky to negotiate the use of alcohol in terms of sexual behavior, so if we could have a more sex-positive Princeton, then perhaps we could rely on alcohol a lot less in the process of getting some. It is the shame we feel that causes us to be hesitant or repressed sexually, and alcohol mitigates that sense of shame, permitting us to be sexual. ,Since this culture is so dominant, what would it mean for Princeton to be sex-positive? It is something that varies from person to person. Like I said earlier, part of sex positivity is figuring out what you want and what you do not want, so for me, I’d want Princeton students to think about their needs and desires more often instead of neglecting them. Chen believes that “what we want could mean anything from just handholding and cuddling to whips and chains” and that “a sex-positive culture means that any individual at Princeton is unafraid to express their sexual identity (including a non-sexual identity! Asexuality, celibacy, and informed abstinence are all part of this conversation too) and can choose to have a conversation about it if they want to.” For Rounsifer, it meant “viewing the act of sex and having a sexual personality in a positive light” and “being able to express your sexuality without judgment from others. If you’re willing to put yourself out there and talk about sex, you shouldn’t be judging yourself about it too harshly.” Here we see that a sex-positive Princeton is one in which students can feel unashamed, honest, and open about their sexuality and sexual activity. ,This is what we strive for Princeton to be like. How far away are we from this? Chen says “no closer than society at large is. However, I think Princeton has much more intellectual potential to understand and converse respectfully on these issues than society as a whole.” Rounsifer has similar feelings: “as a whole, we’re not as sex-positive as we should be. You see flyers about heteronormativity and SHARE and people are trying and working at it, but we need to think of the people that come to Princeton, the backgrounds. It’s tough to figure out how it can be improved. The different groups are trying to have an impact but I think that until, as individuals, we become more sex-positive, it’ll be hard for the entire campus to become that way.”,I agree with Chen and Rounsifer. We could be better, we could be more aware. And that starts with individuals. Go forth and figure out what sex positivity means to you. Figure out what you want from sex, figure out who you are as a sexual being. Then, once comfortable with this, engage in discussions with others about it. And of course, if getting some is what you want, then take action. Hold hands with someone if that’s what you desire, or fuck someone who’s gagged and tied up. Masturbate to some great porn. I don’t care, just make it safe and consensual! You do what you want and I do what I want and we’ll talk about it, accepting and learning from each other.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/sex-positivity/,"

"Greenville, Mississippi looks like a town that the Civil Rights movement forgot. Four decades after the Freedom Summer, this “Queen City of the Delta” still has two of just about everything: two McDonalds, two Catholic churches, two sides of town. There are two Kroger grocery stores. The one with the organic milk and fancy cheeses is called the “white Kroger.” The one with the wilted produce and meager selection is called the “black Kroger.”,And a half a century after the Supreme Court declared “separate” antithetical to “equal,” there are two schools. At the local private academy, the town’s white children enjoy a shiny new building, fly to New York for spring break, and attend four-year colleges upon graduation. At the public school, the local black children—along with the handful of white students whose families cannot afford $5,000 in annual tuition—stare out broken windows, take busses to San Antonio for their senior trip, and struggle to meet the academic and financial requirements to attend college.,This state of affairs shocked me when I arrived in Greenville in July 2006 to begin my two-year stint as a high school English teacher through the Teach for America program. The initial shock, borne of my own naiveté, came when I realized that Jim Crow was still alive and well in the Delta. I had believed the stories my seventh grade American History textbook told me: that the Civil Rights movement had been a success, that all the sitting- and eating- and riding- and praying- and sleeping-in had created a society in which blacks and whites were equal.,The second shock came when I began teaching and tried talking to my tenth-grade English students about race relations in Greenville. In our first unit of the year, we read a first-person account of Rosa Parks’ refusal to surrender her bus seat in 1955.  I asked my students to write an essay in which they compared Montgomery in 1955 to Greenville in 2006. I fully expected them to draw the same conclusion that I had made upon my arrival in Greenville: that present-day Greenville was nearly identical to the Montgomery that inspired the legendary bus boycotts.,I was shocked, then, when I read the essays and discovered that my students believed Greenville was significantly different from cities in the pre-Civil Rights South. They cited the facts that blacks and whites may now ride the same buses and drink from the same water fountains and eat at the same restaurants—never mind the fact that Greenville does not have public buses, nor many public water fountains, and most restaurants display a de facto segregation. A few students pointed out that blacks and whites are now allowed to attend the same schools.,After reading the essays, I brought up the schools issue in front of the entire class.,“Where are all the white kids?” I asked.,They glanced uncomfortably around the room, which was absent of any white faces.  ,One girl piped up tentatively, “They go to private school.”,“So does this mean that we can really say that Greenville is integrated?” I asked.,“We could go there if we wanted to,” another student replied.,“But it’s private school, right?” I countered. “So can everyone go there?”,“Well, white people can go to school here if they want to,” another student pointed out.,“But they don’t,” I said. “What does that tell you about the way things are in Greenville?”,Silence.  ,I went home bewildered. How could my students miss the obvious signs of racial inequality in their own hometown, when I could see them after living in Greenville for just a few weeks? As the school year progressed, I realized that my students were as unaware of the history of Civil Rights as they were of the present state of racial inequalities. When we read “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” several students revealed that they thought Martin Luther King freed the slaves. In a discussion of the causes of the Great Migration, many students suggested that African-Americans left the South in the early twentieth century to escape slavery. The State of Mississippi is not doing much to clear up these misconceptions. The high school American History curriculum begins in 1877—fourteen years after Emancipation.,After the Rosa Parks unit, I decided that I had a mission: I was going to make my students see the injustices at work in their own lives. I was going to use literature as a tool both to teach them about the promises of Civil Rights and to reveal to them how those promises were being broken in present-day Greenville. And maybe, just maybe, after they realized just how unjust the divisions in Greenville were, my students would demand the unity and equality they deserved. By talking to my students about race, I could indirectly help create a more just Greenville.,I started them off by reading The Road to Memphis, a book about sharecroppers in World War II-era Mississippi. Have you encountered the kind of racism these characters face, I asked my students. When Trent Lott was elected Senate Minority Whip in November 2006, I planned an impromptu non-fiction unit that focused on Lott’s history of racial insensitivity. Is this the kind of man we want representing the state of Mississippi, I asked my students. We followed up the Lott unit with a discussion of the Oakland School District’s 1996 decision to consider Ebonics as its own language. Do you think “black” English is distinct from “white” English, I asked my students.,When I taught the same students in American Literature the following year, I continued my crusade to bring about my students’ racial enlightenment. I began the year with a unit on the Literature of Civil Rights, in which we read works by James Baldwin and Flannery O’Connor and Martin Luther King. I followed with a novel study of The Bluest Eye, which focused on the legacy of racism.  As I planned my lessons, I spent more time considering which texts would lead to provocative discussions about race, rather than focusing on how best to teach essential skills in reading and writing.,A year and a half into my mission, Barack Obama delivered his speech on race. As I listened to Obama’s words through the tinny speakers of my friend’s laptop computer, I felt a surge of pride. I counted myself as one of the Americans Obama praised for being “willing to do their part – through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk – to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.” It was okay that I was not teaching my students as much content as I wanted to, that I was not raising their ACT scores as much as I hoped. I convinced myself that I was helping my students in a much nobler way: I was teaching them to see their world as it really was.,Two weeks later, my third shock came.  It was an aftershock, really, since it hit long after the earthquakes of my early days at Greenville had subsided, when I thought the worst had passed.  ,At the beginning of class one Thursday, I gave a lecture about Toni Morrison’s commentary on the history of American racism in The Bluest Eye. Alyssa Stevenson (name changed) put her head down on her desk at the beginning of the lecture. As the lecture continued, she sighed several times with displeasure. After the lecture was over, I pulled her out in the hall to ask what was wrong.  She would not say. She returned to her desk, then stormed out of the room a few moments later.,At the end of the period, an assistant principal knocked on my door and asked to speak to me in the hall. When I stepped outside, Alyssa was leaning against the wall, eyes on the floor.  ,“Alyssa came to my office to tell me that she thinks you’re saying racist things in class,” the principal said.,The shock did not come from being called racist. I had been called racist before, once implicitly by my faculty advisor at summer school in Houston who noticed that I called on my white students more than my black or Hispanic students, and once explicitly by a Greenville parent whose child was failing my class. These accusations did not make me feel much beyond momentary indignation. I could write them off as the hasty conclusion of an overly sensitive observer or the frustrated ravings of a concerned mother.,The shock came from the source of the charge. Alyssa is not a casual observer of my class; she is well into her second year as my student. Nor is Alyssa irrational or vindictive. I have long admired her for her sensibility and self-confidence and have encouraged her countless times to run for mayor when she comes of age. She does not openly express hatred or distrust of me, as many students do. She came to talk to me when she discovered she was pregnant at the beginning of the school year. She has asked me to call her in the evenings to remind her when important assignments are due. Alyssa would only call me racist if she were truly offended by my words and actions in class.,“It’s all you talk about,” Alyssa explained. “You talked about it last year, and you talk about it even more this year.  If the conversation isn’t finished one day, you’ll keep going with it the next day.”,I didn’t know what to say. She was telling the truth. I do talk about race all the time. I do insist on continuing unfinished conversations from previous classes. I considered my obsession with talking about race to be proof of the lack, rather than the presence, of my prejudice.,But Alyssa disagreed. She thought that my eagerness to talk about the history of racism in America and its continued legacy today demonstrated my desire to perpetuate hate in this country. In her words, she thought I was “down-talking” black people.,As with the first two shocks I felt in Greenville, this conversation with Alyssa revealed the depths of my naiveté. I had fancied myself in the same category as the Civil Rights heroes of the 1960’s simply because I moved down to Mississippi and tried to talk at my students about racism. I thought that, with my class discussions (if “discussion” is the correct word for when a teacher stands in front of a room, rants for a while, and then is greeted by uncomfortable silence) I could succeed where the freedom riders and the Supreme Court of the United States had failed. I could bring Greenville one step closer to being a unified city.  ,More dangerous for my students, though, is the narcissism that Alyssa’s comments revealed. By expressing her discomfort at the class discussions that brought me so much pride, Alyssa highlighted whom I was really helping with all my talk of race: not my students, but myself. If I really cared about ridding the world of racial inequality, I would have devoted some of that talking time to doing the job that Teach for America selected me to do: closing the achievement gap. With six weeks to go until the close of the school year and the end of my teaching career, my students still need to be reminded to indent at the beginning of a paragraph.  They still trip over words like “dominion” and “mutual.”  They still struggle to make the 18 on the ACT that they need to attend college in Mississippi.,And there’s still two of everything. I haven’t done anything to change that. According to Alyssa, I may have made the distance between the two sides of Greenville even greater.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/race-classroom/,"

"If you have never heard Van Morrison’s yearning, keening voice—its blues and jazzy swag , the way it stretches words into birds that fly you to heaven, its worn beauty—well, then, you’ve never heard it. But I bet you have; Van the Man, as he is often dubbed (and for good reason), sings at most weddings and bar mitzvahs, plus nearly all soirees destined for the over-fifty set. Party jams like ‘Brown Eyed Girl,’ which is one of the most beautiful songs ever, and ‘Moondance,’ which is one of the most irritating, are as stapled to the celebratory circuit as a celebrity’s stomach is to itself. ,Having had experienced an adolescence nearly void of celebrations—I’m told I tended more toward continual bliss—I hadn’t heard Van until I was about sixteen; to be honest, I had hardly come close: my favorites until then were fellows like Cam’ron, Fabolous, Field Mob. But let me recall for a moment a younger self, sitting at his computer late into the early morning, skimming through Rolling Stone’s “Top 500 Albums” and downloading as many as he could. Somewhere in the 20s, amongst the thirty junky Beatles and Rolling Stones albums that lace the list, lay buried Van’s masterpiece, Astral Weeks. For months, it lay fallow on my computer screen, just another collection of classic mp3s toward a projection of ‘good taste,’ a few files, whatever.,Just files—it’s so odd to think of them as such now. And, honestly, I don’t know how they transcended that form into their full beauty; it might have just happened. Looking back, I can only remember the points of departure and arrival: a moment of never having heard and, some time later, a moment of always listening—by then, already consumed, already transcending. I know I was there; I know I am here.,But how I arrived! And how this arrival is reiterated in perpetual rediscovery! How I still remember riding the school-bus home at night late last March, leaning against the window, the rain falling sadly in streaks. How I still recall ‘Sweet Thing’ from Astral Weeks—‘and I shall raise my hand into the night-time sky,/ count the stars that shining all/ in your eyes’—rising from deep within Van’s potbelly and stirring mine, ‘and I shall raise my hand’ leaping from the music and suspending itself, like his hand, in my ear, the force of his voice imagining the confident force of the gesture, its self-assuredness. Despite the dreariness and the rain, a million stars inside, twinkling.,Van’s all about dancing in the rain—what are stars, if not those dancers in the dark? And the seeing of stars in another’s eyes, dark or not, is, despite that other’s despair, or that projected from oneself, the hopeful gesture par excellence, itself a form of dancing in the rain, of raising the fist through night. Dancing in the rain, not away from it. He cherishes sadness, for it is as human as joy, and is beautiful as such. ,There is a moment in ‘Madame George,’ from the same album: her boys, who seem to be orphans working for the cross-dressing drug queen who gives the song its name, are leaving, this time for good, ‘walking away from it all/ so cold.’ But right ‘as you’re about to leave’—the you presumably a boy, departing, but also every you, all of us, at those moments of irrevocable departure, those most painful of moments—she jumps up from her florid couch—the room is dusty and draped in red, stuffy—and reaches, saying, softly, to them, him, us, ‘you forgot your glove,/ and the gloves to love/ that loves to love the love/ that loves to love.’ Despair is here shown to produce love-reaching—in the real reaching of the Madame, and in the symbol of the glove as both the mediator and resister of contact—which is the reaching of love through despair and in despair toward love, or toward the possibility of love.,‘There you go,/ standing in the sun darling,/ with your arms behind you/ and your eyes before;/ there you go…’ From ‘Astral Weeks,’ the transcendent moment of love—or, rather, the transcendent motion of love. The glove, as the symbol of the caressing reach across the chasm (which is despair), loves; in other words, love is not a place to be reached, or a thing to be had, but a process that can only occur in sadness. ‘Standin in the sun darling…’ Imagine that! That’s Van’s love racing across a long, green plain atop a scraggly cliff on the Irish coast, racing to its edge that overlooks some ocean, and, at the lip, in the wind, standing there with her arms out and singing. The current of love runs above the of the sea of sublimity, right through the ineffable chasm of interaction that can only be entered through leaning, ‘with your arms behind you,’ fully exposed—the chasm which is despair in its uncertainty, its indecipherability and, thus, danger. And you feel, when you’re listening to Van,The music, the music! It races and then hangs, like she, on the pure ecstasy of his exclamation—there you go! The racing and hanging, not knowing if you’ll fall, like the Road Runner before he does. To love is to fly in that moment—and in every other moment—in spite of it all, in spite of the winds…,Not knowing if you’ll fall. Madame George proclaims, ‘and when you fall…’ But you will fall: into the motion of love, or back into the motion toward the possibility of the motion of love. You’re always falling. But you must let your self fall to fall through despair into the motion, the current of love through despair; you must race across the meadow to the cliff, not knowing the lip, not knowing the sea. Everything will fall; as death befalls us all and as Fall will fall, as presently does Spring. Nature is all about falling—leaves fall, and darkness falls, and snow falls and then falls away. ,From this past Fall, until about two weeks ago, I hardly listened to any of Van’s music. I had listened to it continuously since the past Spring, and only to a few songs: all of Astral Weeks and a couple scattered songs (“Caravan,” “Shenandoah,” and “And it Stoned Me” to name all of them). To mix metaphors, I was burnt out from over-listening and the flowing aura of my world was frozen over by Winter. Though Winter is surely Nature, and often beautiful, its world is not the one in bloom that intertwines with Van’s music in transcendence: the snow, though it falls, is still when seen and cold; the air is cold and still; the ice; and we, we are not simultaneous with Nature—we are cloaked, covered. ,But look outside! The flowers are all blooming in the cemeteries and the town greens! The trees’ leaves are blooming! Very fertile things are rising to the surface! A cool breeze caresses the face of the earth, the ‘gardens all misty wet with rain, sha-la-la-la…’ (‘Sweet Thing’); you’re ‘making love in the green grass’ (‘Brown Eyed Girl’), ‘walking down the avenue of trees, when the sun shone through’ (‘Cyprus Avenue’). Oh mango, sunshowers!,Now, we’re in Van territory: the warmth in the wetness, the always coming Spring. Now, I’m in Van territory, back in the swing of things, and there’s nothing like it. Earlier this week—that high-sixties day, the one with a slight breeze, and a sky clouded just right—I sat outside of Firestone and removed my shoes and listened to Astral Weeks all the way through, and it was pure bliss. The feeling exceeds words, but, perhaps, it is related to being washed over by tidal waves of love, or standing at the cliff’s lip, the whole world before you. Whence this bliss? In fragments: the dancing of light on green grass and the music’s joyous skip joining; but also, the dancing of shadows, the slight-dance of rain on the pavement, performing, as the limp in the skip is revealed; the power of the bloom and Van’s voice—like the grass, but also like the dirt that births it; the songs’ beauty, seen, in ‘gardens all misty wet with rain;’ the sadness…Or what about walking through Prospect Garden at sunset—what about that? There’s no one I’d rather accompany me on that walk, with a spring in our step, than Van and his songs: their joy blending with the sunbeams, their sadness with the falling dark; this moment, nothing but love in its ultimate form, springing between light and dark, Winter and Summer—in Spring, in Van’s music.,Nowhere, perhaps, is as Sprung as ‘Astral Weeks’—which is to say, as evocative of and simultaneous with the motion of love and Spring—and he sings, yearning, keening: ‎’If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dreams, could you find me? Would you kiss on my eyes?’ I love that; I love love that. Imagine it! Imagine kissing the eyes of the love who resides in your mind! Imagine what their eyes would see inside you! How they would weep! I mean, it’s a sad song—’where immobile steel rims crack’—and a gritty song—’and the ditch in the backroads stops’—but what’s so brilliant is how Van finds beauty not only on that rolling meadow, but in the sewer and in the steel, in the dirt and hurt of the here and now. ,Perhaps, then, Spring is what Van’s music does: spring Winter into Summer; spring despair into love; spring whoever listens to it into the world that blooms and is beautiful. Spring is the wrong word: his music is always springing, because it is love, and love is motion, from heights to lows and from lows upwards—always springing, always falling. Springing, because love is always in the ‘ditch’ and ‘despair,’ too. Springing, because listening to it alongside the springing of Spring and of flowers and sunlight and sunshowers can do nothing but take you ‘way up in heaven,’ to ‘another time, in another place’ (‘Astral Weeks’). Van Morrison’s music is transcendent, for its sadness and joy and running through meadows is love in motion, and is so much more than just files, and is, for me, so moving—which is in motion toward love.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/brown-eyed-man/,"

"If you were to do a Google search for “Asians Sleeping in the Library,” you would come across a blog that features, well, pictures of Asian students across the globe asleep in libraries, meant to pay homage to their hard work and diligence. If you were, however, to accidentally leave out the very important “sleeping” part of the search, you would instead come across a disgustingly unapologetic video of UCLA student Alexandra Wallace, meant to “poke fun” (definitely a euphemism) at perceived Asian manners and customs.,The video, which was originally posted on March 11, was promptly taken down, but not before causing quite a commotion. It featured Wallace ranting about the lack of respect on the part of Asian students who take phone calls in the library. “The problem is these hordes of Asian people that UCLA accepts into our school every single year, which is fine. But if you’re going to come to UCLA then use American manners,” she says. She goes on to describe a “typical” weekend at school for her, seeing entire Asian families (parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, etc.) running around dorm rooms doing laundry and cooking food. Wallace then talks about her experience studying in libraries, where she apparently reaches an epiphany every time she does her political science work. Her comments, of course, would not be complete without a reference to the Japanese earthquake and her flawless re-enactment of someone speaking on the phone: “Ohhhh! Ching chong, ling long, ting tong! Ohhhh!” ,Various negative comments on the video made Wallace think twice about the video. Unfortunately, taking it down was not enough to save poor girl. Multiple groups had already copied her video and spread it to the rest of the world. Perhaps more interesting than the video itself,though, were the varied responses it received. It, of course, ignited a firestorm of parodies, remixes, and equally angry rants against her. Asian Advocacy groups and blogs, like “Disgrasian,” demanded that UCLA administration take punitive action; internet memes were created almost immediately; websites have leaked photos of a bikini shoot Wallace did; YouTube artist Jimmy wrote a song in which he translates what “Ching chong, ling long, ting tong really means,” and so on. ,While no one has come out in full support of what Wallace said, reactions have been very different among individuals. When I interviewed non-Asian students here at Princeton there seemed to be a general consensus that Wallace is an idiot who should never have been allowed near the internet. Senior Aku Ammah-Tagoe said, “,I couldn’t watch past the ‘ching-chong’ point; it was pretty brutal. I almost don’t think it’s worth reacting to, because it seems impossible that any “right-thinking” person would agree with her.” Interestingly, I found that, generally, the Asian community on campus was not as furious. Senior Joe Jung told me he “was less indignant than amused,” adding, “but I obviously object to her views.” “I thought it was a ridiculous but a humorous video. I didn’t take this video very seriously,” stated freshman Isabelle Song. Most of the Asian students I spoke to had similar responses, while non-Asian students were much angrier. Apparently this is not the case at UCLA.,I spoke to a friend (currently a junior) and asked how the UCLA community was holding up in the face of Wallace’s infamy. “My initial response was that I thought it was a joke.  When I realized she was serious, I felt embarrassed for my school,” she said, going to explain that many Asian students were having a hard time coping—some had even required counseling. According to her, some of her non-Asian friends “didn’t really care” because they weren’t being targeted in the video. One even went so far as to say that “Wallace had suffered enough, and [they] should just let it go.” ,Once the video went viral, Wallace apologized in the school newspaper, The Daily Bruin, and removed her contact information from the university’s system, having received threats (including death threats) via phone and email. Since then, UCLA administrators issued official statements against Wallace’s opinions, promising to look into whether or not the video violated any school rules, but condemning those who attacked her. ,Rumor has it, “Asians in the Library” was meant to be the first of many in what Wallace had hoped would be her new video blog. What a shame. I’m sure that would have been a very enlightening blog.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/racists-library/,"

"Last November, Josh Blaine was traveling down the coast of California, with the vague intention of reaching Mexico, when he stopped in Santa Barbara.  Outside the city’s art museum, he caught sight of a man sitting next to a bike and a tennis racquet.  Josh approached him and asked about the racquet.   ,“There’s no bullshit about this guy.  He’s honest, upfront, real,” Josh said in a telephone interview late last month. ,Josh soon found out that “this guy” was forty-four-year-old Pennsylvanian Ken Loch, who told him about his life philosophy, Tennissance.  Tennissance sees tennis as an exercise that can aid in understanding the connections among the mind, body, spirit, and soul.  At the end of the conversation, Loch gave Josh a slip of paper with the Tennissance website written on it. ,“He used a lot of weird lingo; you could tell he wasn’t making this shit up.  I was on my way to the library to check my e-mail, so I looked briefly at the site.  It looked kind of weird,” remembers Josh. ,Josh is a Princeton student in the midst of a year off from school.  A native of Winchester, Massachusetts, he had flirted with the idea of taking time off since he entered Princeton in the fall of 2002.  The Russian literature classes he took during his sophomore year with Caryl Emerson convinced him that he needed to fulfill his dream of spending time away from Princeton to ask questions and figure life out. ,“Tolstoy wrote his works as an intrusive genre (meaning he wanted the reader to not just ‘read’ his books, but to ‘live’ them),” Josh wrote in a follow-up e-mail after our interview. “As I got further and further into Tolstoy’s works and life, my desire to take time off grew stronger…Tolstoy was constantly challenging us (or me at least), to find a greater truth—a truth that dug deeper than anything you could learn in a classroom or a book (even one of his).  His challenge to himself was centered around a search for perfection, and that translated to his writings.” ,Josh finished his sophomore year and announced his decision to leave school for a year.  He was determined not to have a plan: “Obviously, as someone in search of complete freedom, I couldn’t commit myself to any sort of program or even plan of my own that would hinder my ability to live according to the present,” he explains. ,He spent the summer working at a summer camp in California just south of Yosemite.  After camp ended, he lived with his brother in San Francisco, near where their sister was working.  He stayed there until November, when he hit the road for Mexico, hoping to end up in Xilitla, a town where he had volunteered the summer after his freshman year.  He was hitchhiking, sleeping in bushes and under park benches (which he admits “sounds very Kerouac,” but adds with a smiley face emoticon, “I still like to think that it was very ‘Blaine’”) when he stopped in Santa Barbara and met Loch. ,Over the next few days in Santa Barbara, Josh ran into Loch several times, and Loch gave Josh a further explanation of Tennissance.  Loch’s words struck the same chord in Josh as had the novels of Tolstoy. ,“When I bumped into Ken, I was still thinking of continuing down the coast, but he really challenged me like nobody had since Tolstoy,” he wrote in his e-mail. “I think the first time I bumped into him I actually went and wrote my friend Page an e-mail saying that I just met a guy who reminded me an awful lot of Tolstoy (or what I imagined Tolstoy was like).  It was also blatantly obvious that he was a free man, in every sense of the word.  He made my ‘freedom’ laughable.  I suppose that’s why he got to me, because he proved simply by example that I was so far from achieving the kind of freedom that I was looking for.   I wanted to be as free as he was.” ,After a two-week trip to San Francisco, he returned to Santa Barbara and within an hour of being in town, he ran into Loch in a bathroom.  Loch told Josh he planned to drive down to Santa Monica, and Josh decided to travel with him.  One day at the beginning of their trip, Josh jokingly asked Loch to give him a Tennissance lesson.  They stopped in a parking lot, and Loch gave Josh a fifteen-minute lesson., “I saw something, understood something, right away.  The stuff on the website sounded weird on the website, but I started to understand it when I actually did it,” says Josh. “I started to ask myself, ‘What would happen if he actually teaches me this?’”  Tennissance, a combination of the words “tennis” and “renaissance,” is an ambidextrous, non-competitive exercise.  It attempts to give its students an understanding of all the elements of tennis.  A Tennissance student learns to execute each stroke (forehand, backhand, and serve) with both the left and right hand, and with both topspin and backspin.  When a student has mastered Tennissance, according to Josh, he should be able to know that he is doing something, but not know quite how he is doing it.  Josh compares the ideal state of Tennissance to “The Zone” that many athletes claim to feel when engaging in their sport. ,“You transcend beyond what you’re actually doing.  You don’t need to understand.” ,Like yoga, Tennissance brings a philosophy along with its physical exercise; tennis is only a physical illustration of the Tennissance philosophy.  Josh sees Tennisance as rooted in the aesthetic tradition of Plato, Kant, and Hegel.  The goal of Tennissance is complete integration of all elements of human existence.  The tennis element tries to connect the mind and body; the rest of the philosophy integrates the spirit and soul. To describe what he means by soul, Josh asks, “What on earth is going on here?  I’ll just ask people, based on what they do, or what they’re studying, I’ll say, ‘Why are you doing what you’re doing?’  People really don’t know.  I noticed it. I was looking around, and since I’ve been back on the East Coast, I’ve been asking.  Most people don’t know.  The soul part is to get to the point where everybody knows why they’re doing what they’re doing.” ,He emphasizes the fact that Tennissance is not a religion.  “It requires no faith,” according to Josh. “It simply is.”  In fact, he claims that Tennissance “makes religion not necessary” because it is more “complete” than either religion or philosophy. “If you ask someone religious, ‘What is God?,” they probably get to the point where they wouldn’t be able to answer the question I ask them.  The point of Tennissance is that that would never happen.  It’s complete,” asserts Josh. ,Tennissance’s completeness is the philosophy’s main draw for Josh.  Josh was raised a Reform Jew in a temple that his parents co-founded over twenty years ago.  He recognizes “a lot of truth and goodness” in Judaism, yet adds, “I think I always felt that there was something about it that just didn’t make sense.  There were still some unknowns, or mysteries that I couldn’t justify existing.”,Josh understands that his explanation of Tennissance’s philosophy is somewhat confusing: “Part of the point is that I can’t explain it to you until I take you out on the court,” he says. 	 After his first Tennissance lesson, Josh bought a cheap tennis racquet. For the rest of their month-long trip through California, Josh and Loch drilled for an hour or hour and a half each day (weather permitting), slept on the beach, and went to the local library.  As it turned out, they could only play tennis for about half of the days they were traveling because of heavy rainstorms. ,“Even when we weren’t on the court, it didn’t matter.  My understanding was still increasing,” says Josh. ,Throughout the trip, Loch and Josh remained the only two followers of Tennissance; Loch the teacher (or, as he identifies himself on the Tennissance website, “the genius of Tennissance”) and Josh his first student.  Josh believes that it’s only a matter of time before Tennissance takes on a large following. ,“This isn’t small; this is kind of a big deal,” he says. ,Josh and Loch have been making contacts in the tennis industry: with the United States Tennis Association, the United States Professional Tennis Association, the Professional Tennis Registry, as well as publications Tennis Magazine, Tennis Life, and tennis companies Wilson and Prince.  They also plan to make an instructional DVD. Josh says that the industry has expressed some interest despite the fact that there is “a lot of red tape, a lot of bureaucracy.” ,He is not deterred by Tennissance’s lukewarm reception.  “It takes some time to understand this stuff.  There’s a general trend to people saying, ‘Huh, sounds interesting.’  It’s still in its infancy.  It started to take off when he [Loch] started to teach me.  Everything has to begin, everything has to start somewhere.”  In mid-December, Josh sent an e-mail to a group of his Princeton friends to tell them about his “cool new project.”  Word of Josh’s new “tennis religion” spread quickly around the Princeton community.  ,“I was at Mexican Village in January, ostensibly celebrating someone’s birthday, and the only thing my end of the table could talk about was Tennissance,” says senior Jennifer Albinson, a friend of Josh’s. “It’s as if Ken Loch’s powers have even infiltrated our own subconscious.  We’re fascinated by how he’s entranced Josh, not realizing that he’s simultaneously entranced us.”,When he returned to campus a few weekends ago, Josh says that people he didn’t even know came up to him to ask about Tennissance. ,“I’ve suddenly become ‘Josh Blaine of Tennissance,’” he laughs. ,Though curiosity about his new project has been universal, enthusiasm has been mixed.  Nearly everyone Josh told about Tennissance reacted at first with skepticism.  Josh says that if he takes the time to sit down with someone and explain it, though, the skepticism usually fades. ,“If I sit down with someone in person, I can walk away knowing they understand what I’m talking about.  It’s hard to talk about it over e-mail, or quickly over the phone,” Josh explains. ,When Josh first told his brother about Tennissance, he was unconvinced of the philosophy’s merits.  A few weeks later, however, they went to dinner at a Chinese restaurant, talked for three hours, and came to an understanding. ,Josh’s parents took longer to win over.  They were worried about Josh’s “homeless” existence in California in the first place, and they reacted to Tennissance with similar concern. ,“They’re not that thrilled about it,” admits Josh.  He thinks a moment, then adds, “Actually, that’s not true…I’ve told them, if you want to understand it, you have to go on the court.” ,About a week after our interview, Josh gave a Tennissance lesson to his mother, making her his first student. ,“I had her for an hour, and I must say it went pretty well,” he wrote the follow-up e-mail. “It was basic day one stuff, but I had her doing what I wanted her to be doing by the time it was over.  I guess it was successful then.”  My own attitude toward Tennissance followed a similar path to that of Josh’s family.  When I first heard about Josh’s involvement in Tennissance, I laughed. Looking at the website did not help much in changing my negative impression. Statements such as, “What is tennis’ enlightenment? Primarily, it’s the enlightenment, which is witnessed by the genius of tennis. That enlightenment is the genius of tennis’ self-realization and rebirth,” confirmed my suspicion that Tennissance is exactly the kind of wishy-washy spirituality that Josh would later claim it isn’t. ,After talking to Josh, however, I experienced some of the same waning skepticism that his family and friends have described.  Josh is smart and thoughtful, and he talks about Tennissance with a combination of humility and authority. He acknowledges the skepticism with which most people approach Tennissance and admits that the website needs some fine-tuning before the general public finds it accessible. , Yet Josh is unabashedly committed to Tennissance.  When I sent him an e-mail requesting an interview, he responded within an hour.  Less than a week after our interview, he e-mailed me to request I write the article as quickly as my schedule permitted. He wants to spread the word.   One element of the Tennissance philosophy continues to sound rather alarming, even after an extensive conversation with Josh.  One is the Tennisance website’s claim that Michael Chang is mentally ill.  Michael Chang is a Christian tennis player who won the French Open in 1989.  In 2002, he started the Chang Family Foundation, whose aim, according to its website, is “to introduce the Good New of Jesus Christ to the World through local and international programs; and to grow and nurture people in their personal relationship with God.”  I don’t follow tennis, and I thought that perhaps Chang was indeed struggling with a mental disorder.  There is no mention of mental illness, however, on Chang’s own website or on any of the fan sites devoted to Chang. ,When I ask Josh about Tennissance’s assessment of Chang’s mental health, he assures me that Chang is indeed mentally ill—just not in the common understanding of the word. “We’re using a different definition of mental illness.  There are a lot of things that people say they understand that have changed in meaning over the past 100,000 years,” Josh says.  As an example, he points to the word “educate,” which, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, used to refer to the rearing of young animals. According to Josh, mental illness is “the belief in false concepts,” engaging in, as he calls it, “self-trickery.”  Under this definition, Josh says, President Bush is mentally ill because he claims to be a Christian yet started the war with Iraq. ,“He’s doing things contrary to what Jesus is preaching.  There’s a divide between what he says he believes and what he’s doing,” Josh explains., Similarly, Michael Chang is mentally ill because he is a Christian yet plays competitive tennis. ,“He probably does understand the mind/body connection in some way, yet he’s not doing it in line with the teachings of Christianity.  A truly spiritual understanding of tennis wouldn’t be competitive.  It doesn’t make any sense.  You’re not trying to defeat them, not trying to be better than anybody else.” He adds, “The whole concept of competition is that someone is better than someone else, which contradicts all religions.” To his credit, Josh makes sure to add that he sent Chang an e-mail telling him about the Tennissance website’s claims about his mental health.  He never wrote back. ,“Technically, we tried to make him aware of it,” says Josh.  This extreme claim aside, Josh has done what few Princeton students even dream of doing; he has taken a break from the resume rat race to ask important questions of himself and others. His education has moved him to action.  His Tolstoy class made him want to be a better person, not just a better student or a better writer.   ,”I feel silly talking to him about things like my thesis or what I’m going to do next year, as he so very much lives in the present,” says Jennifer. “Thinking about things like deadlines and future sources of income appear nonimportant.”,And indeed, this is Josh’s goal with Tennissance: to encourage others to challenge the way they live their lives.,“I know a lot of smart, together people who are not able to answer questions of what it means to be a human being,” Josh observes. “What on earth is going on here on earth?  The purpose of Tennissance is helping, healing this problem.  Things could be so much better.  Why are we settling for this?  As human beings, we could be so much more.  Everyone is just settling for a half a tank of gas.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/for_love_of_the_game/,"

"Being an outsider—or at least portraying yourself as one—pays in a Princeton USG presidential race.  For the past three presidential elections, the USG Vice President has run and lost to a candidate that promised to be a breath of fresh air in the stale world of Princeton student government.  During the 2002 campaign, the hot issue was the new seven-week moratorium for varsity sports teams.  Then-Vice President Sonja Mirbagheri said that she planned to work with the administration to overturn the moratorium.  Her opponent, Pettus Randall, suggested staging a sit-in at President Tilghman’s office.  In 2003, though Jacqui Perlman boasted of her superlative experience on the USG, Matt Margolin’s promises to “raise hell” and “redefine tradition” proved more appealing to the student body.,	Neither Randall nor Margolin could assert true outsider status, either politically or socially.  Randall was USG Senator before becoming President; Margolin was a U-Councillor.  Furthermore, Randall, a KA in Cottage, and Margolin, a member of Ivy, were both comfortably nestled in the Princeton mainstream social scene.,	When this year’s USG presidential nominees were announced, it appeared that the race was going to run the same as always: the vice president (Shawn Callaghan) vs. the “outsider” (Leslie-Bernard Joseph).  Callaghan emphasized his experience with the USG, urging his constituents to “Be a pal again, vote for Cal(laghan)”, while Joseph promised to “preside over a cultural shift in the organization of the USG.”  As in years past, the challenger beat the champion.,Unlike his forerunners, however, Joseph seems to have a legitimate claim to “outsider” standing.  The former head of the Black Student Union, he had never held any USG office before running for President.  He wanted to go straight to the top. “I didn’t want to be the treasurer.  I wanted to say what needed to be said,” he told me last month in an interview in his Feinberg dorm room.,Joseph’s Princeton social experience is also different from past USG Presidential candidates. Joseph is not a member of an eating club.  “I can’t afford it,” he explained, adding, “Financial aid for eating clubs is not what they say it is on paper.”  He is an R.A. in Wilson College, a position which he said makes him more aware of the mental health, sexual harassment, and alcohol problems that Princeton students face.,“Other USG members might not know what it’s like for freshman girls first semester on the Street,” he pointed out.,Accordingly, nearly all Joseph’s plans for the USG this year involve making Princeton a more “inclusive” place.  Besides his highly publicized vision of “Princeton in the Nation’s Service” day, Joseph also hopes to see a revolution on the Street.,“I want the four main Bicker clubs [Cap, Cottage, Ivy, T.I.] off pass two times a semester,” Joseph said, as a solution to the perceived exclusiveness of some clubs on the Street, “especially those considered ‘quintessentially Princeton.’”,While the “outsider” strategy is apparently fool-proof for getting a candidate elected, it remains to be seen if such an attitude can be sustained throughout a Presidential term.  Randall’s anti-moratorium sit-in never occurred, and while Margolin raised some decent-sized hell over grade deflation, the issue’s most important outcome—Dean Malkiel’s explanatory letter to graduate schools and employers—resulted from working with, not against, the administration.  It appears that you can only be an outsider for so long; once elected, you have to play by the rules.,Joseph has already been chastised for his unconventional, aggressive e-mail style. After two weeks of e-mails with subject headers such as “Take it to Tilghman” and “Let’s Shake Things up a Little” that opened with the salutation, “hey whassup everyone,” administrators asked Joseph to assume a more professional tone.  “Note: This e-mail will not contain my usual jovial tone,” he wrote in a February 17 message to the student body about the report on race.  E-mails since have demonstrated a more subdued, “presidential” voice.,Indeed, despite his professed disdain for “nuts and bolts” issues, Joseph’s achievements so far have been, though appreciated, rather quotidian: increasing the e-mail quota, including a cross-cultural classes section in the Fall’s course guide, promoting “Sweat,” last weekend’s USG/Alcohol Initiative event at the Fields Center. ,Furthermore, his “Top 10” article in the premier issue of Green Light magazine displays a more than willingness to praise the Street culture he claims to disdain.  Included among the most powerful people at Princeton were officers at Ivy and T.I., two of the exclusive, “quintessentially Princeton” eating clubs.,Nevertheless, Joseph professes to remain committed to the idealism of his campaign.,“If you can’t tell your friends what you’re doing on the USG and have them be excited about it, you’re not doing your job,” he said.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_insider_outsider/,"

"There is a War on Doing Less going on in this campus. And, not unlike many great wars before it (Second Punic, Cold, Fox television’s “The War at Home”, etc.), you may not realize which side you should be on until it’s too late. The war is fueled by a vast and destructive propaganda machine and an entire Activities-Industrial complex. And it is a war that you are fighting in—whether you know it or not.,The activities fair. Peer advisors. Bhangra posters. The lecture from some sort of NGO official in McCosh 50 that the hipster girl across the hall is attending who would totally love to see you there. They want you to Do More, to get involved, to try out, drop in, tune out the world and tune in to the glories of activity. They say doing more will be fun. “It builds your resume”, the seducers purr. “It is healthy, or creative, or fulfilling. No experience necessary.”,After all, look at you. You aren’t experienced, sure. But they believe that you too can one day be a cup-stacking, belly dancing, bee-keeping phenom. They want you to be one. You want to be one (and you’ll need to be one, too, if you want to get that job at McKinsey after graduation). All you need to give is your time.,A quick disclaimer—please, do not take this as an ode to sloth. Making the most of your time at college is a noble goal. But it is a fallacy to think that making the most of your time means doing more, taking on a role, becoming someone.  ,“It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being.” F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that, about some spoiled aristocratic boy, and it seems to have become a slogan for the Princeton student today. It’s painted on the walls of Frist, along with a menagerie of other wildly out of context things that Princetonians have spouted. Somewhere along the way, we started to take it to heart—we want to become something. Bankers, mostly. Doctors. Lawyers. Writers. Politicians. We want to, and we’re expected to. Who wouldn’t want a return on all the time and money invested here?,But if there’s nothing wrong with becoming, there is something wrong with the steps we take to become. If we have become anything, we are resume builders.,I know—it’s a tired enemy to attack. Many an author and college counselor has warned of shallow commitment to too many activities. We are supposed to invest in a few, to craft ourselves into archetypes that are easier to sell. Surely then, the remedy to doing more is to do less, better.,Another slogan or motto some like to live by: “I wished to live deliberately… to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.” A man with a beard wrote that about his time living in the woods. He didn’t go to Princeton, so we don’t like to quote him as much, but a lot of people do regardless to justify their becoming. Doing more, they say, is just living deep.,Yet even Thoreauvian self-reliance has become a brand, an identity and not an identifier. Thoreau (or, insert your other favorite rustic ponderer), as a brand, is clearly about Doing More. At the least, it has become about lowercase doing more, about committing deeply to activities and building up an identity as someone who cares about select, important things, about becoming the Philanthropist, the Religious activist, the Actor, instead of being just the Generalist.,This article is not about assuming a façade of deep commitment to a few issues. This is about working to find out what you actually give a shit about, and freeing your time to do that. This is about being open to things that you may not think you should give a shit about, but finding out that you do regardless. This is about truly doing less; or, as Thoreau says in what follows the aforementioned quote about sucking, this is about learning “to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life”.,It seems counterproductive. After all, the Princeton student has been bred for competition and ambition. It’s not in our nature to step back. Suggesting that we do less is like trying to start an intelligent conversation about controlling population growth; no matter how gently one brings it up, they will be labeled a baby murderer.,I am here to murder your babies, metaphorically.

"Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way”,Lady Gaga’s new music video tries really, really hard to jump on the current 1980s revival but it’s the worst kind of awkward sci-fi. The whole thing feels clunky, overdone, and manages to make orgies seem lame. Three strikes and you’re out.,I didn’t think it would be possible to ruin Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” theme but Mother Monster manages to make it seem positively silly. Maybe it’s because she combines it with the unicorn-as-a-motif-of-individuality and what appears to be a sparkling rainbow.  ,My first real point of contention is the really unsubtle use of the LGBT pink triangle radiating out of Lady Gaga’s vagina. Then there is the weird feeding tube coming out of her chin; is that a Japanese porn thing? It’s also impossible to ignore the fact she creates a mythical planet named “Ongoat.” Really? Ongoat? Isn’t this video supposed to be in support of the sexuality spectrum and not equating it with bestiality? And am I the only one who detests the swirl of rotating lotuses? Maybe I would get the profound symbolism if I were tripping, but right now it just seems like a lame attempt at multiculturalism.,I don’t even know where to start with the ongoing fisting montage in a kaleidoscope, which is supposed to suggest an “infinite birth.” No matter what way you spin it, that is gross. Far more vending machine than MILF, which is made all the worse by the narration that “this is the eternal mother in the multiverse.” Say what? ,Next we are bombarded with the worn-out imagery of evil represented as a black-and-white 1920s cabaret singer wielding a Tommy gun. This seems like a lukewarm rehashing of the foxy Nazis in “Alejandro.” Weak. The voice over of “how can I protect something so perfect without evil?” Worse. ,Do I respect the aerial view of crouched sex-gremlins as Lady Gaga/Eternal Mother/Mother Monster walks around in hot underwear? Yes. What I don’t understand are the weird sharp cheek implants that make her look like a soft-neutral-lipped Marilyn Manson with surface piercings. Peculiar. Almost as peculiar as the video’s end with her wearing Michael Jackson-esque fringed gloves while sporting Lara Stone gap-teeth and a peroxide blonde Mia Farrow haircut while crying in front of an alleyway on fire. ,To summarize:,
Simulated masturbation: 8 times,
Misfits facial makeup? I call copycat.,
Unicornometrics: rainbow opening + in front of a flaming city = 3/5 stars.,
Writhing in a faux placenta? Hot.,
Nude body suit with zipper nipples? Not.,
Overplaying the 80s gay kitsch? For sure.,
Other wise known as: a visit to a transgendered gynecologist while dropping acid. ,Ke$ha’s “Blow”,I really have no words to describe how awkward this video is except: this might actually be serious.,
Where to begin? It opens with “no mythological creatures were harmed in the making of this video,” which seems quaint until the rainbow glitter bloodbath scene.,But before that, we are introduced to Ke$ha regaling her unicorn-headed but people –in-formal-wear-bodied guests about how she got elected to the Parliament of Uzbekistan, via “grabbing a bear and making it put its pants on.” Which, all right, I’ll admit it, I’m into until… she takes an ectasy-like tab of what is apparently a piece of Munster cheese on a miniature Triscuit. ,Then she grinds up on a unicorn, and licks it.,I give her props for this weirdness and originality until she starts French kissing an eye-patched unicorn. That’s where you really have to draw the line. From then on it descends into lameness with the Jennifer Love Hewitt facial expressions, (head-tilting, side glances, just general dramatic limpness), awkward crotch grabs (oddly unisexual coming from Ke$ha), and an awful pelvic-thrust-walk slow-mo of the main love interest in the video. ,I did enjoy, however, the bra scene where Ke$ha pulls hers out of her dress and then, wait for it, the dude does the same thing out of his dress . . . shirt! No one expects that, no one. The best part is her look of confusion and his sexual smirk as he sassily tosses away the undergarment. Really, who comes up with this? I mean, the man does have definite pec definition but the bra was really an unexpected twist. ,The dialogue of the man and Ke$ha is also pure ridiculousness. Played by Dawson’s Creek’s James Van Der Beek at his self-deriding best, he and Ke$ha discuss the merit of Munster cheese, which is determined to be “edible lactose gold.” Ummm?,They then agree to dance but it turns out “dancing” is really a euphemism for a deadly rainbow laser tag that kills the dinner party of unicorns. Of course.,Finally, the video ends with a lovely touch of the absurd as Vanderdouch becomes a wall-mounted head, like a trophy, titled Vanderdead, which is accompanied by a pan around the room of surviving Unicorn faces, a cackle from Ke$ha, and then a sudden BLACKOUT. ,Which is I guess how I would summarize this video: it’s like when you blackout. It seems like an awesome idea at the time and then you wake up the next morning covered in honey and broken glass and realize what a horrible mistake you just made.  Oh wait, that’s from personal experience. Well, this video is like that, but instead of honey its unicorns and instead of broken glass it’s a weird neo-Medieval rave, and instead of a hangover its just Ke$ha cackling. So basically, it’s the same thing.,Kanye West’s “All of the Lights”,I LOVE that this has an epileptic seizure warning. (Which was only added a day after it was released.) ,I LOVE that this starts with surprisingly heart-wrenching black-and-white footage of an adorable child walking through a city alone.,I LOVE the typography. It’s a wonderfully modern take on 1980s neon. So well timed, so many subliminal messages.,I LOVE how the phrase “Ghetto University” is repeated. And pantomimed. ,I LOVE Rihanna’s bra/suspender contraption. She makes side-boob look fierce.,I LOVE how Kid Cudi doesn’t show his face until a minute into his singing.,I LOVE how all the guests on this track that you don’t hear, like La Roux, Alicia Keys, Fergie, John Legend, Charlie Wilson, The-Dream — all get buried under the verbal credits while Kanye’s name is repeated again and again.,I LOVE how low-key and different this video is compared to Runaway.,But I also LOVE Kanye. So I might be biased. ,But really, I am really into this video.  You should embrace it, live it, love it.,I would even watch this if I had epilepsy — I think the seizure would be worth it.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/epileptic-unicorns/,"

"Mafia–the ultimate pre-orientation/term break trip game. There’s no better way to bond as a group than killing and turning on each other.,In the game, a team of killers strikes secretly at night, then try to conceal themselves as an angry mob decides whom to kill (Historically, it was “lynch” instead of kill, but considering that word’s place in American history, it makes sense to use another).,HISTORY,In the eighties, psychology researcher Dmitry Davidoff at Moscow State University needed to find a less boring way to teach psychology to high school students. He decided to have them kill each other in secret and turn on each other by day to learn about mob mentality. Naturally, the game became popular with young people and spread to the West. Colorful additional roles were added. It was commercialized as a card game called “Werewolf.” It inspired a Latvian game show of Latvian celebrities playing Mafia (“Serial Killing with the Stars”?). It prompted an ethics investigation at a middle school. It has been studied by psychologists as an example of reading body language and other nonverbal signs.,CHARACTERS,All except God are assigned randomly, by drawing playing cards. Adjust to fit number of players. Note that all roles after Doctor are dispensable.,God/Narrator/News Broadcaster – Must make up the story behind each person’s death. Note that this character can be called by any of these names, to avoid heated debate over whether there is a god, and whether playing with a “God” character implies that there is a god, and whether such an argument takes a party game too seriously. Stays “awake” at all times, knows all. Like God. Like Walter Cronkite. Selected based on talent, not by card.,The Bad Guys,Mafiosi (two or three Kings) – Jointly or singly kills someone each night. (Note that it is, in fact, racist to assume that the Italian person in the group is a Mafioso.),The Townspeople,Detective/Inspector/Sheriff/Investigator (Ace of Spades) – Inquires into someone’s guilt. Usually is wise enough not to reveal what information he has.,Doctor/Medic/Nurse/Angel (Ace of Hearts) – Saves someone’s life (potentially his own). Bound by the Hippocratic oath.,Prostitute (Queen of Hearts) – If she visits you at night, you’re occupied for the evening. Whatever work you were going to do at night (killing, inspecting, saving, etc.) will not get done. PG-13 variant: Bartender, gets his customer too drunk to do his job. PG variant: Stranger who gives you candy, his candy makes you sick.,Pimp/Jack Bauer/Dentist (Jack of Clubs) – Bitch-slaps someone. In the case of Jack Bauer, round-house kicks someone in the face. In the (lame) case of dentist, removes someone’s tonsils. Then his victim is not able to speak during the accusation round.,Village Idiots (two Jokers) – Desperately want to be executed as Mafia. They work as a team; their goal is to both be killed off.,Paranoid Gun Owner/Vigilante (10 of Spades) – Is very paranoid of people coming near his house at night. If he is actioned by another character, has the opportunity to shoot the person who actions him (be she Prostitute, Mafia, Angel, Detective, Pimp).,Medium (8 of Hearts) – Inquires into the guilt of the dead. Just like the Narrator, but can only ask the Narrator about characters who have died.,Corn (3 of Clubs) – If killed, has the opportunity to come back to life one time by stealing an already-dead person’s identity.,Lady Gaga (7 of Diamonds) – When killed, has the power to take someone else of her choice with her. Because all her love is revenge. Because you’re a criminal as long as you’re hers.,Star-Crossed Lovers (pair of red twos) – When one of them dies, the other one must die.,Tree Stump (6 of Spades) – Does nothing. At all. Can admit at any time that he or she is the tree stump, but dies upon admittance.,All other players are ordinary Townspeople (even more boring than the Tree Stump).,SET-UP,Everyone sits in a circle. God counts out exactly as many cards as there are non-God players (the cards that assign the roles included, and however many filler cards as necessary). Players pass the deck and each player draws one and learns his role. God collects the cards.,GAMEPLAY,It is Night. God tells everyone to go to sleep (close their eyes). Then he speaks.,“Prostitute, sleep with someone.”,She wakes up, points at someone, goes back to sleep. When God comes to that person’s role, he skips them.,“Mafia, kill someone.”,Both Mafiosi wake and decide through nonverbal communication whom to kill.,“Doctor, save someone.”,The person he points to is protected from death in this round.,“Detective, investigate someone.”,The Detective points at the person he suspects of being Mafia. The Narrator nods or shakes his head.,“Pimp, slap someone.”,The victim is not allowed to speak during the accusation round.,Contingencies,If it is the first round:,“Village Idiots, dance.”,Each Village Idiot wakes up and sees who the other one is.,“Star-Crossed Lovers, exchange vows.”,Each Star-Crossed Lover wakes up and sees who the other one is.,If one or more people are already dead:,“Medium, channel someone.”,She points to a dead person she suspects of being the Mafia.,If someone actions the Paranoid Gun Owner:,“Paranoid Gun Owner, shoot or don’t shoot?”,He nods or shakes his head, totally unaware of whom he is or is not killing.,It is day. Everyone wakes up. God explains, with as much detail as he chooses, who died, who was saved (whether he needed to be saved or not), and who was bitch-slapped. Gameplay usually involves a God who tries to make up amusing stories of how each person died/got saved/got bitch-slapped. (Note that small children are frightened by scary stories. When a fifth-grade class in New Hampshire played Mafia, one little girl had nightmares of “reliving” her death. When the mother tried to get the game banned from the school, its champions spoke up, saying that the game has an important positive message–good people working to snuff out the bad guys.),Dead people immediately go silent and become observers of the game. The angry mob round begins. All living people begin arguing over who might be the Mafia. “I heard a rustle over there,” “Laura has a smug look on her face,” and “Adoley is doing it for revenge” are all valid reasons to accuse someone. These accusations usually end up landing on two people. Once popular consensus has narrowed it down to two, God takes a vote; each person raises his hand to indicate publicly whom they want to execute. The person who gets a majority of votes dies. Ties are not allowed—in the event of a tie, everyone begins arguing again until someone changes his mind.,Contingencies,If Lady Gaga dies:,Lady Gaga can choose to shout out the name of someone to die with her.,If Corn dies:,Corn chooses an already-dead person and takes her card (card unseen). If he is the first to die, he hangs in limbo and then takes the card of the next person to die.,If one of the Star-Crossed Lovers dies:,God announces publicly who the Star-Crossed Lovers are, and they both die.,Optional rules:,“Dying breath” – Upon dying (if not Lady Gaga or Corn), shout out someone’s name: in English if you think he’s innocent, in Pig Latin if you think he’s guilty. Nothing to say? Say “rosebud.”,Time limit – Limit accusation/debate time to five minutes.,Secret ballot – Have each person write down the name of the person they vote to execute. Advantage: Gives the Village Idiots the chance to vote for themselves without arousing suspicion. Disadvantage: Takes time.,Return to night. Skip the roles of any character who has died. Repeat the night/day cycle until one of the following outcomes is reached.,POSSIBLE OUTCOMES,(1) the Townspeople win: They execute all Mafiosi while there is still at least one Townsperson living.,(2) the Mafia win: They kill off all Townspeople. Only Mafiosi (one or more of them) is alive at the end.,(3) the Village Idiots win by being executed by the mob. Both of the Village Idiots must be executed by the mob (not killed by the Mafia) for the Village Idiots to win. Once one Village Idiot is killed by the Mafia, the Village Idiots cannot win and the other Village Idiot becomes an ordinary Townsperson.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/mafia-rules/,"

"The morning of the Colin Powell lecture, I stood in line outside of Richardson Auditorium with my friend Beth. Beth takes Arabic. Last summer, she worked for a senator in Washington. She just applied to Woody Woo. She knows her Public and International Affairs. ,I, on the other hand, am going to be an English major. Maybe. I haven’t taken the prerequisites, but I do really like to read. I figure that’s enough. My knowledge of current events ends in about 1997, when my history teacher stopped giving my class weekly quizzes about the front page of the New York Times. I do know enough to know that the United States is currently engaged in a War on Terror, and that we invaded Iraq last spring because some people thought that Saddam Hussein had Weapons of Mass Destruction. We caught Saddam (I still don’t understand why we call him “Saddam” instead of “Former Dictator Hussein,” but that’s for the experts to decide, I guess) and will soon bring him to justice. I figured this was all the background information I needed before attending a lecture delivered by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.,Bored while waiting to pass through the metal detector, I examined my ticket. It said something like, “The George F. Kennan ’25 Centennial Conference featuring U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.” ‘Who on earth is George F. Kennan?’, I asked myself. I figured he was a rich alumnus who had donated a ton of money to bring illustrious public figures to Princeton. I nudged Beth.,	“Um, are we supposed to know who this guy is?” I asked. (Expected answer: “Beats me” or “Of course not!”),	“Yeah!” said Beth, sounding surprised. “He wrote the Long Telegram.”,	I stared at her blankly. I thought about how when the Titanic was sinking, the guy in the telegraph booth tried unsuccessfully to solicit help from the nearby ships. I guessed that this was not “the Long Telegram” Beth was referring to.,	“He basically wrote the policy of containment.” When I still showed no signs of recognition, Beth added, “Which was a really important policy during the Cold War.”,	I nodded. “Ohhh, right. Of course.”,	When I took European History in high school, we ran out of time before we got to the Cold War. To fill the gaps in our knowledge, my teacher handed out a sheet of Important Terms from the Cold War. “Containment” was on it. So were “glasnost” and “perestroika.” I never bothered to memorize the definitions of these terms. I was accordingly horrified when I sat down to take the AP European History exam and saw that one of the essay questions was: “Discuss the United States’ policy toward the USSR during the Cold War.” My response went something like this: “During the Cold War, the United States adopted a policy of containment combined with glasnost and perestroika toward the USSR. This strategy proved to be quite successful, as evidenced by the fall of the Berlin Wall in the early 1990’s, which marked the end of communism in Europe.” The AP graders gave me a “3” for my efforts on that exam, a score that denotes “average knowledge of the subject matter.” Perhaps I should have added that David Hasselhoff performed at the celebration of the destruction of the Berlin Wall.,	Beth and I presented our tickets and PUIDs to a woman in an orange beret with a large pompom on top. After we took our seats, I perused the program. The page about George Kennan described containment as the base of American foreign policy toward the USSR during the Cold War, adding that “there were significant departures from Kennan’s original understanding of the term.” I was momentarily satisfied with the knowledge that I was not the only one to have misunderstood the policy of containment.,	My satisfaction turned to near smugness when Secretary Powell took the stage. After the initial jokes to warm up the crowd (“It looks like the students got the cheap seats,” Powell quipped after he noticed that most of the people in the lower level of the auditorium had gray hair), Powell admitted that when he was a soldier during the Cold War, he didn’t know much about containment, either. “What was my mission?” he joked. “When the Russian army comes, stop it.” I laughed until I realized that I didn’t know what he could have been referring to. “Powell’s too young to have fought in World War II,” I thought. “And we didn’t fight the Russians in Vietnam, did we?”,	It went downhill from there. Monday’s Daily Prince reported that Powell talked about how “The United States must continue to focus upon the ideals of democracy, human rights, and rule of law.” Apparently, I missed that. Beth was furiously taking notes. I was confused.,	Then, all at once, things started to look up. In defending the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq, Secretary Powell said, “there was no doubt in my mind … that there was no intention on his part not to have the intention for such weapons and programs.”,Ha! I elbowed Beth.,	“Check out that triple negative,” I whispered.,	“What?” she asked. Her blank look, I thought, must have been very similar to my expression a little while before, when she had mentioned containment.,	  “He just used a triple negative,” I said. “‘I have no doubt that Saddam had no intention not…’”,	Beth frowned. “Right.” She turned her head back to face Colin Powell. Within a few seconds, she was scribbling notes again. I just sat back, content to know that I had just caught the Secretary of State of the United States of America in a grammar error.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_english_major_and_the_policy_speech_an_e/,"

"“And really, I think I like who I’m becoming,” rapper Drake admits on “Crew Love”, a track from his recent sophomore attempt _Take Care._ On that track he’s talking about trading dreams of graduating from Harvard for the ability to smoke weed in cool places and support his family with his wealth, from craving a paper on the wall to paper in his wallet. It’s a hesitant embrace of abandoning comfortable middle-class aspirations for a messier, grander, more self-determined existence based on art. ,The hesitancy of that embrace is key. _Take Care,_ like the rapper that birthed it, is also in a constant state of becoming. In terms of style, Drake claims to be much softer than he was on his debut album _Thank Me Later._ “She says they miss the old Drake, girl don’t tempt me,” he warns on single “Headlines”. While tracks like “Make Me Proud” with Nicki Minaj or “Lord Knows” with Rick Ross still bump, it’s more due to the guest verses or the beats than Drake’s introspective reflections, on topics such as the men who must deal drugs to buy Christmas presents for their daughters on “Lord Knows”, or his crooning hooks (“I’m so proud of you”, he cheers to Minaj).  Leave Drake alone now and you get songs like “Good Ones Go”, the album’s sung interlude in which Drake begs a girl to keep waiting for him—“don’t you go getting married, don’t you go get engaged…can’t lose you, can’t help it, I’m so selfish.” Compared to his solo tracks on _Thank Me Later,_ like the aggressively sexual “Show Me a Good Time” or bombastic “Over”, “Good Ones Go” is practically a Michael Bublé tune. ,Like many music artists, Drake now expresses disdain for singles; in an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, he even claimed to hate them. You won’t find the swagger that dominated on tracks like 2009’s single “Forever”—except, of course, on the aforementioned single “Headlines”. Drake is now outwardly much more broken heart than “sprained ankle” that shouldn’t be messed with, and yet he can still slay a beat, simultaneously comparing himself in all seriousness to a mob boss and complaining about the emotional knockoff rappers he’s inspired (“All My Children,” he jokes). ,Drake, on the other hand, does nothing to hide which artists have inspired him. True to his roots, Drake offers guest spots primarily to label-mates from Cash Money records like Lil Wayne and the label’s weird “father” Birdman. “Weezy and Stunna [a Birdman alias] my only role models,” Drizzy declares, though confusingly he also names Hugh Hefner and Michael Jordan as his only role models in the next line. More confusingly, Drake’s evident musical influences are very far from those provided by Weezy and Stunna. For one, Drake panders much more to the independent music scene, bringing in producers like British remix artist/big fan of steel drums Jamie xx and allegedly keeping a copy of dubstep introspect James Blake’s first album in his Toronto studio. These influences, heard in songs like “Take Care” and “Make Me Proud” keep _Take Care_ fresh.,An influence that quickly grows old, however, is Drake’s desire for historical context. In contention for the Least-Original Claim to Heritage award is Drake’s statement “I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix, I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished,” on “Lord Knows”. While Drake may share some cursory background details with each (Hendrix spent some of his childhood in Canada, and Marley was also biracial), the statement reads mostly as a tired way of saying he will either die after a relatively long life or flame out while young. These icons provide shoes that are too big too fill for Drake, at least after so little time as a musician. ,Drake’s different facets all come together in the witch’s brew that is “Marvin’s Room”. Recorded in the same LA studio where Marvin Gaye spent the latter half of the ‘70s brooding over his divorce, this single is everything that is great and everything that is wrong with Drake. It’s overly soft, even in the production, and oh-so introspective as Drake contemplates calling a gone but not forgotten ex. He eventually does, only to rub the breakup in her face (“I’m just saying, you could do better. Tell me, have you heard that lately?”). It’s cruel, and yet somehow beautiful.,Drake is no Marvin Gaye in terms of vocal strength, but he at last produces something that feels real and original. “When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You?”, Gaye’s song recorded in the same studio about the dissolution of his marriage, is a message to an ex as well, but he focuses on the good times they had and how he can learn from it. Drake, in “Marvin’s Room”, keeps it raw and twists the dagger, contrasting his depression and bitterness with rhymes about cognac and the good life. If this song represents what the artist who is becoming Drake will create in the future, it may not be too late for him to fill a pair of Marvin’s shoes.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/becoming-drake/,"

"MONOLOGUE FOR A NERVOUS GIRL IN A WHITE BIRTHDAY CAKE DRESS AND SHINY LEATHER PUMPS  ,(A deep breath and then go) ,Okay so this one time I was eating dinner with a friend at a food center in Singapore and we were talking about our usual high-falutin’ topics in the tropics like shopping and art and the meaning of life when all of a sudden we saw this white potbellied middle-aged man with a young Asian woman in a birthday cake dress you know like one those big puffy white dresses you would wear when you were nine and she had this big pink necklace around her neck and her hair was done in a long, thick plait down her back and I thought oh my god, does she actually think she looks cute? Or no, wait, did this potbellied white middle-aged man actually lead her to believe she looked cute? Did he dress her like that? Did he deceive this girl who must have come from some poor bumfuck backward country that what he was giving her to wear was nice? So there she was sitting there like some strange withered doll-child that wasn’t supposed to have happened with this straggly-haired stubbled drunk red-faced cliché of a worn-out Vietnam vet. And when she asked could she please have some coconut juice, he said no, firmly like to a little child and she looked really sad but he just ignored her and continued drinking his beer and when he was done they got up they held hands and walked on home and we didn’t know what to do like was that love or abuse? In our righteous anger we wondered if we should call a shelter but anyway I forgot about all this until I talked to my friend again recently and she reminded me about it so actually this isn’t really my memory. (A breath) Just the other day my boyfriend called me and said hey remember this kid who went to college with us he’s here in Singapore now working as a lecturer at a tertiary institute and he goes around bragging that he has a Thai hairdresser girlfriend who lets him fuck her in the ass. I am trying to be liberal and all that so it’s not the fuck her in the ass part I have an issue with it’s the Thai hairdresser part and how her sole talent seems to be her anal fuckability. I don’t know why this kid went to college at all especially an Ivy League college I mean what a waste of resources that could have been diverted to Thailand to build a school or something. (A breath) Ok but now I have a confession to make it’s a really big stinking dirty confession and I hope you won’t despise me for it. Uhm uhm uhm okay here goes uhm I have a thing for Japanese cartoon porn. No I really do no please don’t laugh at me yes I like to look at Japanese cartoon porn with those little schoolgirls who secretly want to be raped and those dicks squirting cum in their faces. Ok that last part actually does make me sick but part of me is like oh my and I have to go touch myself. (Small pause) Also while surfing porn recently I found an online forum where white women discussed wanting to sleep with black men and wrote elaborate erotic fantasies about being whisked away from their boring ass husbands and having hot and naughty love affairs with those giant black dicks in the Bahamas. Of course someone has to raise the question of racism and of course angry and defensive responses crop up saying, hey, these fantasies are legitimate. Personally I don’t agree with that but I’m not going to police anyone’s dream sex life and anyway here I am buying into cutesy Japanese schoolgirl porn that says hey yes we really want it, please, put it in my mouth.   ,ELEPHANT  ,Once upon a time, there was an elephant who lived in the jungle. He drank from the streams and fed on the tall trees around him, and he was happy. Then one day, the elephant was crossing a road when suddenly he was hit by a car. When he woke up, he found himself in a cage where many people looked in at him from time to time, made strange noises, then went on their way. He had lost his memory because of the accident, so he could not remember where he had come from. All he knew was that the water he drank was dark brown and the leaves he ate from the ground were old and dusty. And there was nothing to do but walk in circles in his tiny cage.  From this point onwards the elephant’s fate might have taken the following turns: The elephant, neurotic and frustrated in captivity, attacks and kills his zookeeper and escapes. He runs as fast as he can as the other keepers chase after him, but he has no idea where he is headed because he has lost his memory. The keepers catch him soon after and either break his spirit or kill him.  A female elephant arrives one day in his cage. Even though she may not be what he considers attractive, she is female, and they mate and have a baby elephant that pleases the zoo greatly because they have contributed to elephant conservation. The live in the zoo forever, happily ever after.  The elephant is trained to do fun tricks like standing on a beach ball and putting a hat on its head. He learns fast and becomes the star performer at the zoo’s daily show. He also learns to walk more slowly so people can ride on his back, so he can walk in much bigger circles than the ones he made in his cage. After consistent good performance, he is upgraded from a cage to an open enclosure, where there are no bars but only natural barriers, like ditches, to keep him from escaping. He also can mingle with other elephants, and he meets a female elephant, they mate, and they have a baby elephant that pleases the zoo greatly because they have contributed to elephant conservation. The elephant is an ideal elephant and the zoo is very proud of him. And having lost his memory, he thinks that he is happy.   Questions to consider and discuss after reading: Which of the above do you feel is a happy ending? Why or why not? Is there any way for the elephant to get out of the zoo? Might the car driver have done something to help the elephant? Even if the elephant had not lost his memory, would he have been able to find the jungle again? What if the jungle were no longer there? What would he do then?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/two_fictions/,"

"There is good reason to be excited about Dean’s Date.  On May 10th, after all the computer cluster bickering ceases and the papers are handed in, you would be well-advised to take a walk to the Record Exchange and pick up Weezer’s fifth album, Make Believe, the band’s third release in four years.  As if the deal weren’t sweet enough, Weezer is going to be playing Philly that very night and New York on May 11th and 12th. ,In late March the new album’s first single, “Beverly Hills,” hit the airwaves and MTV (the video was shot at the Playboy Mansion – make of that what you will).  The band has made it clear on its website that “Beverly Hills” is but one song among many, that it’s the “fun” song, and that the album itself is a varied and legitimate Weezer album, but they and fans alike need not busy themselves apologizing for this tune.  ,“Beverly Hills” isn’t as poetic as “Butterfly,” as raucous as “Tired of Sex,” or as deeply personal as “Say it Ain’t So,” but there is much to be hopeful about in this new track.  In “Beverly Hills,” frontman Rivers Cuomo sounds alive again – the enthusiasm of this song comes out in its dangerously catchy chorus and a driving drum line that makes you want to clap your hands as Pat Wilson keeps the beat (and may remind you a lot of Joan Jett’s “I Love Rock n’ Roll,” but who cares?  You do love rock n’ roll, right?).  The band is at its best and most animated from 2:43 onward, the part of the song (finally a real OUTRO!) that you will be playing air guitar to and singing along with all summer.  Seriously folks, I’m not f’in around here – imagine the prospect of a post-Pinkerton Weezer album that you do not have to apologize for liking.  This is the promise of Make Believe.,It’s not that I have hated the band’s last two efforts; I’m not one of those fans that hates anything new or different, but I feel like the last two efforts missed the mark, though the band seemed in 2002 to be getting closer and closer to producing a masterpiece on par (though not identical) to their eponymous 1994 debut.  Now that the band has re-entered the public consciousness once again, I have heard a few things about this album.  Rivers has apparently had something of a spiritual awakening, leading the band to produce an album that guitarist Brian Bell has described as “a mixture of Pinkerton and [The Blue Album] with some Maladroit guitar solos.”  If that is true, then Weezer may finally be ready to hand us another masterpiece.  This moment is not the result of any radical departure in style or substance however.  The band has been building toward this album since they returned to the spotlight in 2001 with the out-of-nowhere, drug-laced hit “Hash Pipe.”,Three albums in four years may seem impressive, but Make Believe was no rush job.  In fact, of those four years, three were spent on rehearsing and recording for this upcoming album.  After many fits and starts, acoustic rehearsals and soul-searching, and the scrapping of entire demo sessions, we will finally find what the band has been up to the past few years.  ,In 2002, Rivers and company seemed to be headed for Zeppelin-like productivity after releasing their fourth album Maladroit only 364 days after their previous album, Weezer (commonly known as The Green Album), was released.  And this was all in the midst of a massive, seemingly non-stop tour!  This rapid-fire treatment has led some fans to wonder whether Maladroit shouldn’t have just been called Weezer III.  ,Despite the spacey and metallic quality of Maladroit’s vocals and guitar tone, it is still a very intimate album.  With Rivers’ emphatic “yeahs” and “aws” complementing the guitar solos, seemingly spontaneous background vocals that sound more like interjections commenting on the lyrics, and each song ending with screeching guitars as if each band member simultaneously let go of their instruments (rather than the lame and oft-used “fade-out”), Weezer here sounds like a touring band that stopped in at a small studio in the middle of nowhere and started playing.  For die-hard fans who had been disappointed in the structurally repetitive and flat-sounding Green Album, there was a reason to celebrate, and to be hopeful in the band’s future endeavors.  ,There was a festive atmosphere in Maladroit that was missing from the comparatively cold Green.  It felt like the band was rocking together in the studio, and the listener was rocking with them, but what was still missing in Maladroit is the emotion and the sort of geeky awkwardness that characterized the band’s now-legendary first two albums, 1994’s Weezer (The Blue Album) and 1996’s Pinkerton.  As drummer Wilson recently pointed out, “You can totally hear [the lack of emotion in Green and Maladroit]. It sounds like we’re just kind of stoned out, like a Seventies rock band who tours all the time.”,Many fans reacted to Green and Maladroit very negatively, partially because the songs fell short of the greatness of the band’s earlier work, but also because the final products did not resemble the ingredients they had gotten to sample months before the albums were released in stores.  As any Weezer fan probably knows, the band has historically been extremely generous when it comes to online content.  For instance, during the Maladroit demo sessions near the end of 2001, the band posted new studio demos daily, spurring impassioned discussion among fans on the message boards.  The band had done something similar in the summer of 2000 with songs they were working on and playing live for Green.  Fans were pissed about Green because the songs they heard at shows, later known as SS2K (Summer Songs 2000), not only did not make the cut but were replaced with songs that had a very different sound and had an average length of less than three minutes per song.  Fans waited five years for a 28-minute album that, though certainly a pop gem in the great scheme of things, was static, safe, and uninspired.  ,Fans had less to be upset about with Maladroit.  The band produced the album on its own, and financed part of the production as well.  The recording process was transparent up to the very end; they even upset their record company greatly by making available on their website what basically amounted to finished copies of all the album tracks months before Maladroit’s release.  What fans did note after getting to see the entire process was that Rivers and the rest of the band could let loose in the studio and be very experimental when there was little at stake, but when it came time to craft an album, the band (Rivers especially) shied away from anything that didn’t resemble the three-minute pop format (Verse – Chorus – Verse – Chorus – Solo – Chorus).  ,Maladroit clocked in at only 33 minutes, sporting an average song length that was actually shorter than Green.  Solos and unusual parts from the demos were eventually cut in the interest of brevity.  The band was having a ball in the studio and out on the road, and while that attitude certainly breathed life into Maladroit, the band’s dynamism did not translate into taking the actual music to new places.  So while a stranger to the album demos can have quite a good time with Maladroit, the obsessed fan knows what he’s missing.  ,With transparency came a feeling of ownership that had perhaps been present before in Weezer fans but most certainly was realized most fully during this time.  Fans felt they should have a say when it came to song choices and styles, and Rivers only encouraged this mentality by entertaining a host of fan suggestions from the message boards, even going as far as participating in a separate (and mostly confidential) musical discussion forum with concerned musical aficionados.  These experiences have led Weezer to declare in a recent interview, “You have to hate us to be a true fan.”  It is clear that the band learned their lesson in observing how they have produced Make Believe, releasing few demos after Summer 2002 and revealing few details about the songs.,The summer of 2002 was an exciting time to be a Weezer fan – the band put on some of their best shows ever on the Enlightenment Tour.  I saw them three times in four days; the setlists were decided by a lottery the band ran before every show, and every night featured a different set of songs.  For the first time since perhaps 1996, the band was playing a significant number of tracks from Pinkerton, the commercial failure (and raw emotion) of which had left Rivers up to that point unwilling to play many of those songs live.  Off the stage, the band’s free-for-all studio sessions seemed to have finally jarred Rivers out of his post-Pinkerton hollowness.  He was singing about watching the World Cup in Daegu and giving advice to an anonymous mother figure, and experimenting even further with singing styles and song structure.  The last great burst of material to be shared with fans arrived in the middle of summer 2002.  ,True to their newfound form, Weezer recorded and uploaded 24 brand new songs to their website at the beginning of July, less than two months after Maladroit hit the shelves.  It became evident that instead of worrying about the bottom line, the band preferred to tour indefinitely and record and release music as often as possible.  These particular sessions saw Weezer incorporate a keyboardist and attempt to fashion their sort of White Album.  There were rumblings of another album set for a Winter ’03 release – that would have been an INSANO three albums in twenty-one months, the same time it took for Page, Plant, Bonham, and Jones to release Led Zeppelin I, II, and III.  But at some point during the rest of that year Weezer decided to slow down, and soon disappeared from the limelight once again.  ,Was it a fear of producing bad music that led Weezer to put the brakes on?  Some fans wanted the band to slow down and take more time to craft a better album, but it is more likely that record company intervention (Maladroit sold only 470,000 records, a little more than a third of Green’s sales) played a hand in the band’s change in attitude.  Whereas the Beatles’ breakneck album production allowed fans to observe the evolution of their sound and style, to witness experimentation as it took place, Weezer fans would never get the chance.  And here we are three years later, expecting the world and more, when all we might really get is a sense of what the band has been playing like for the past six months or so.  ,As far as whatever that style may be, what fans should demand of Rivers (and of the band) is not a return to the old, but a stop to the practice of deliberately trying to avoid the old (e.g., avoiding singing with emotion and writing personal lyrics), a mindset which Green fully embodies.  Something tells me Make Believe will be different – all indications seem to show that Rivers and the rest of the band have shown up for this album.  Make Believe will be more than simply a collection of songs that you can hum in the shower.  I can feel it.  2005 is the Year of the Weez.,Album releases and singles,1994 – Weezer (The Blue Album) – “Undone (The Sweater Song),” “Buddy Holly,” “Say it Ain’t So”,1996 – Pinkerton – “El Scorcho,” “The Good Life,” “Pink Triangle”,2001 – Weezer (The Green Album) – “Hash Pipe,” “Island in the Sun,” “Photograph”,2002 – Maladroit – “Dope Nose,” “Keep Fishin’,” “Slob”,2005 – Make Believe – “Beverly Hills,” “We Are All On Drugs”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/weezer_invites_you_to_make_believe/,"

"I.,Outside #01-239, the post office in Lucky Plaza, they leer at her, and she wonders what the three of them are doing there. Don’t Bangladeshi workers belong in Little India? Still, she appreciates their dripping smiles, thumbs hooked in the pockets of their pants, hips thrust forward. She knows what it means to be hungry. ,	She has grown fat in this country. Life must be good for you there, say her relatives in Ilocano, pinching her fleshy arms and her pockets when she returns home every other year. The man she calls her husband has squandered her youth and her earnings, sent faithfully par avion every month for the last six years. This is for a taxi-car, so you can start earning for yourself, too. He bought a new stereo and threw karaoke parties for his friends. This is for the house—maybe we can build an extra room and rent it out. He lost most of it playing mah-jongg, his sister finally confessed, the rest he spent on beer and cigarettes. Lately he’s been staying out late at night; watching soccer with his friends. Now he only calls once a week, to save her money. Last week the sister said she thought she saw him with a woman.,	She is only in her mid-twenties but she no longer knows if she is attractive. Her days are spent with an eighty-nine-year-old man, feeding him porridge with thinly diced preserved vegetables, wiping up the drool that collects in the crevices of his face, sponging his leathery raisin body before it shrivels any more in the heat. She cleans his penis gently with soap and water, then pats it down with Johnson’s baby powder. She has never been so familiar with a man’s body before; sometimes she thinks she knows him better than his daughters do. She hopes she will be there for her own father when the time comes.,	After a quick glance in the glass door of the post office, she runs a hand through her curls and flashes a smile at the men. One of them, she notices, almost looks like a Bollywood star, if not for the pockmarks on his face. She holds his gaze for a few seconds before brushing her hair away from her neck. The Bollywood star leans back to say something to the other two men. They laugh. One of them punches him on the shoulder and then, after giving her the once-over again and licking their lips, the friends clear off. She pretends not to notice, turning to face the postage prices posted on the door before bending down to adjust the strap of her heel, her miniskirt riding up a little higher. He comes so close to her that they brush against each other as she straightens up. They laugh hesitantly, momentarily embarrassed. He places a muscular hand on her waist to steady her, and whispers in her ear. ,As he presses against her under the stairs, his fingers fumbling urgently with her bra, she asks him, teasing, Do you and your friends come here often to look for Filipinas? He grins and says in lilting English, Our construction site is nearby. ,Afterwards, the shirts on their backs soaked with perspiration, they share a mango lassi. ,II.,Three o’clock in the afternoon. She almost drops the towel wrapped around her breasts when she unexpectedly hears the door. He bursts in, a surprise guest in his own house, his pale face flushed from being in the sun. Hello, he replies to her startled face, I took half a day off today. I need a break from work so badly. ,Yes, Sir, she mumbles, then ducks into her room to dress. But not before he can trace the line of her collarbone with his eyes. ,	An hour later she brings the freshly-ironed laundry into the master bedroom, placing the pantsuits and skirt suits into the IKEA-organized closet as quietly as she can, trying not to wake him. But when she turns to leave, she sees that he has been awake for a while. Has he been watching her? Come here, he says with a smile, tell me, is everything okay back home? ,So nice that he always asks, she thinks, if only his wife were just as kind. He gestures for her to sit on the bed and she does, teetering tentatively on the edge. She tells him that her father is ill, coughing again because he smokes too many cigarettes, but other than that the rest of the family is fine, her younger sister getting married soon to a factory worker, her elder sister in Hong Kong doing well, her two brothers living off the money their new wives send home from abroad, so she thinks maybe she can finally start saving for a small business, a grocery store or something. Then suddenly she finds his hand in her lap, resting quietly on her thigh like a limp white handkerchief.  ,	She is not surprised; for the past six months she has seen the signs. The wife on the phone in the middle of the night, the sound of the sobs keeping her from sleep. Some nights, being waken up by the slam of the bedroom door, peering out to see Sir making a disgruntled bed on the couch. Sir and M’am start to have breakfast separately, tiptoe around each other in the evening, one in the study on the computer, the other on the phone in the bedroom, watching TV. Even a four-room condominium can become a maze, a land of hide-and-no-seek. Last month he bought a sofa bed and put it in the study.    ,	When he shifts his weight onto her she gazes at his hairy chest and thinks about her cousin who married an American man and now lives in California. Mrs. Donald Aubrey, she says to herself, the name lingering on her lips. Mrs. Donald Aubrey. , 	That night, she makes a bitter gourd dish for the real Mrs. Donald Aubrey, who gobbles it down without thinking twice. ,III.,From + 96654249183 to +639192434397,Sent 06/07/2003, 4:59 p.m., Dubai: ,Dearest Mami, I miss your breasts and your smelly little pikpik. Please call me soon, I need to hear your voice. Love, Papi.,	9:15 p.m. in Singapore. She cannot help but giggle when she receives the message, even though she is pretending to be asleep. But she is truly, truly, tired. She doesn’t think she can take another Can I have a Milo, Aunty? Can you help me finish my art class project? Can you wash the car tomorrow morning? Can you take Ah Ma to the temple? even though the family is good to her. No. Not for tonight. At midnight it will be their ninth anniversary, a relationship that has spanned almost a decade and three countries, consummated once every two years or so. They are not as lucky as the Cowherd and Weaver. ,She wonders if she will have enough money to go home this December, even though it will be a busy period for the hospitals in Dubai with the rainy season coming on. At least she will get to see their son, who is already five. He called her “Aunty” when she took him into her arms last year and she cried. Her mother said, Never mind, he’ll understand when he starts going to school.  She wonders what he will grow up to be. The day before her mother called to say that he sang along to the chorus of “Top Of The World” on their karaoke machine. Maybe he will become a pop star and take her to America with him. ,Lighting streaks across the sky and the clouds rumble. The Cowherd and Weaver are crying. She dozes off to the pitter patter of the mid-year monsoon, her fingers still wrapped around her hand phone. ,	She dreams of Papi. He is wearing his nurse’s uniform and he is leading a camel in the desert to an oasis. She is lying naked in the water, her long hair strewn across the sand, an olive in her mouth. Papi takes his clothes off and climbs into the water while the camel drinks. He sucks her nipples gently and she arches against him, but when she opens her eyes he is Jesus Christ and he is bleeding all over her body. The water turns red but the camel keeps drinking. Then something is buzzing in her hand. Something is buzzing and buzzing and buzzing.,	She snaps awake to find her handphone vibrating. Papi, it says on the screen, Answer or Reject. She presses Yes, and puts the phone to her ear. Hello my darling-darling, it says in Tagalog, did you forget all about me? I was waiting for your call all evening and I’ve already had my dinner. I’m too full to eat you anymore. ,She laughs. Silly man, she says, who wants to be eaten by you? Anyway I’ve grown too fat already, you won’t be able to finish me. ,He laughs. Who cares? I still want to marry you. But I don’t know if you want a man with a potbelly. Hmm? Do you? ,I don’t know, she says, depends what he has in his wallet. ,They laugh. Then a pause. ,Hey darling, he starts, ten years already, you know? I’m still waiting. When? ,Silence. ,Not yet ten, she finally says, nine. One and a half more years on my contract. ,My God, he cries, you want me to wait more than ten years? Honey –  ,She stops him. Don’t you want Jerome to go to college? There’s no work back home, you know. Let’s not argue about this today, it’s our anniversary.,He sighs. ,Okay. You win. But now I’m going to make you suffer.,She giggles as he peels her panties off with his teeth and kisses her oyster, saying, Mmm, smells like home. Sometimes if she comes hard enough she thinks he is really with her, buried deep inside her as when they fall asleep together for twenty-seven precious days, when the time jingles and the piggy bank is ripe. He only has thirty days of paid leave a year; also, if she is gone for more than a month, what will happen to the little girl and the old woman? Just yesterday the little girl showed her a book she made with the title, My Family, and on the last page it said, In my hous ther is allso my Antie, who cook for uss evrydae and I love here very mach. Family, she thinks, she has a family. ,	Not enough time on his phone card. She is cut off at the brink of orgasm, her hands still gripping her pillowcase. She tries to call him back, but there is no satellite reception. She sits up, frustrated. The rain beats on. Quietly, she steps out of her room into the washing area, to watch the water abuse the trees.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_selected_sex_lives_of_filipina_maids/,"

"In perhaps the greatest scoop of the year, specialists with the Nassau Weekly Department of Literary Espionage discovered an advance copy of J.M. Coetzee’s newest work in the men’s room stall of “The Mother of All Bathrooms” on the 300 level of Frist over intersession break. Coetzee, a South African expatriate, won the literary world’s highest honor—the Nobel—this year to wide acclaim. His novels include Waiting for the Barbarians and Disgrace . Coetzee’s most recent novel, Elizabeth Costello, dealt with a celebrated public intellectual whose nomadic travels all over the world bring her in touch with her long lost brother, Elvis, a down-on-his-luck musician. During this encounter Elizabeth achieves self-knowledge, and realizes that her soul had been hindered by such fame. Elizabeth, although a woman character, has traits that echo the autobiographical protagonists from many of Coetzee’s previous works—lonely, old, deceptively smart men. Publishing Elizabeth Costello as the heels of his Nobel, Coetzee seemed to be sending a message to the literary world that he scarcely could stand their abundant attention and even their interest in his work. But what message does this new, as yet untitled novel send to his readers and to the literarati? Is it an acute encounter with bigotry? An account of personal loss? A misanthropic reaction to his prominence? Or something completely different? Let’s find out!,From Chapter 2:,…The Tuesday afternoon ritual had become, in a manner of words, disturbing. I wore the key to Diane’s family cabin along the Cape coast on a lanyard around my neck. All week the lanyard rubbed and chafed against the hairy back of my neck. Only on Tuesdays would I remove it, so the key could unlock the cabin’s wooden door. When I would arrive at 3 in the afternoon, I would leave open the door to allow the warm water breeze to flow through the small house and push around the stale air that had been for trapped for the past six days. I often felt like taking off my shoes and socks and unbuttoning my shirt and running over the sad lawn toward beach to stand ankle deep in the water. Instead I always just waited inside the cabin, churning over in my head the reasons I kept returning here week after week while the breezes cooled my passions.,Usually an hour later, Faraja would arrive in silence, her bare feet making no sound against the wooden floorboards. I think she owned only this one dress that she always wore. The fabric was of a simple cotton and the floral pattern was something one would be more likely to find a small girl wearing instead of a woman. Faraja never wore underwear when she met me for this rendezvous, but I don’t think she ever wore them either. Today I was sitting near the window looking through a childhood photo album of Diane’s when Faraja stepped in the cabin. We exchanged no greetings, but I stared at her for several uncomfortable seconds until she undressed.,	“It has been a long week, Faraja. A long and stressful week.” I said. Her pendulous breast now swayed before me and I spoke about my troubles and the events that had befallen my business since our last encounter. “The drought in getting worse, Faraja. You know Modibo, the boy I hired to mind the dogs? He found four of the yesterday in the middle of one of the fields, all huddled together, dead. They were so thirsty they must have tried walking toward the river 5 miles away. But in this heat they could not make it.” She just stared at the ground, nervously nodding. I don’t think she has ever made eye contact with me. “And on Saturday we discovered rats hat been in the warehouse for months. Rat shit is everywhere. So much merchandise ruined. This will cost be thousands of rands. And it all could have been stopped by a few cheap traps, you know.”,She could care less about my stories and the events of my life, I knew. Faraja only wanted to get it over with, as soon as she could, and then forget I even existed until next week. I led her toward Diane’s childhood bed at the other end of the room, the bed where my ex-wife had slept over so many vacations, through so many thunderstorms that bombarded the Cape, where she had had her first kiss, her first period, and where she had learned about history and geography from that ugly governess who died a few hears back. I sat Faraja down, removing my belt and with it tying her wrists together behind the railing. The brown leather of the belt seemed to be the same perfect shade as her brown skin.,With Faraja bound in this position I quickly became aroused. She kept her almond eyes closed tight while I removed my clothes: the farmer overalls and fiftycotton/fiftypoly blend t-shirt, my threadbare socks, and the crocodile-skin cowboy boots given to me by an Aussie client from a posh neighborhood in Melbourne. Her closed eyes did not see the slack skin which hung off my bony white body, sagging in the middle, below pairs of protruding ribs. Faraja shuddered when I entered her, but also grinned as I kissed her body. And she never says one word…,From Chapter 6:,…This morning I filled the roller-suitcase with several days worth of clothes, a pair of swimming trunks, and my camera. About 50,000 rands, the very last of my savings, were stuffed into brown paper bag. Walking out the door just now I forgot, then remembered my passport and the tickets for my one-way cruise. The drive toward the coast allows me to see for the last time those dead brown fields I own where every gust of wind from sea kicks up a clouds of dirt from the dry earth. I will probably miss driving around the country in my truck, listening to BBC news on the AM radio. ,It takes close to three hours for me to arrive at the port. I can see the giant white ship floating beside the dock as if it were featherlight. It is called the “Pacific Princess.” Holding my South African passport, I slowly step forward in a queue toward the gangway. There is a gay couple in front of me speaking in Afrikaans. Both of these guys are thin and fit and demonstrative in their conversation with a great deal of hand movement and facial expressions. When they recognize me as a fellow Afrikaner, they slow their speech, as if attempting to hide from my probable eavesdropping. The queue is long, and after a while we begin to talk.,“So you are South African? Where are you from, man?” I am asked by the taller of the two.,“I grew up near Pretoria.

They had the ship’s bursar, who acted like he was gay, too, take a picture of them before they disappeared onto the ship.,Aboard the Pacific Princess my cabin was cramped and deceptively well accommodated.  I placed my bag of cash underneath the bed and stretched out atop the covers. The drive and been long and sunny and I was already tired. I did not look forward to the 8 day long cruise. We would be putting into several ports of call throughout the Indian Ocean along the way—Perth, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Reunion—I had heard from others that each would have its own selection girls and drugs. Most of my sources agreed that Thai twelve year-olds and Ecstasy were the best combination. I told everyone that I was too traumatized to fly, but secretly I chose cruises for the whores. I already knew that I would bring them back to this little, windowless room as soon I could find them, spending the evenings pumping away, their impervious faces showing no hint of pleasure from my slack, sagging, half-tan/half-pale skin. While I was daydreaming there was a knock at the door. When I opened it the black steward handed me a note and said, “From the Captain” and then walked away. The captain of the Pacific Princess was Merrill Stubbing, an Aussie who I had met years ago in Sydney. We were friends for a little while, but had lost touch for at least a decade and I had no idea that he had gone into the cruise ship business. He had seen my name on the ship’s roster, and was inviting me up for a drink to his cabin. I actually weighed the offer in my mind, but quickly decided to go. Slipping the note into my pocket, I checked myself in the mirror and walked out toward the bridge…,Golly! That J.M. Coetzee sure is great! This novel is totally awesome! I couldn’t put it down! Why, it’s nothing but a masterpiece in the genre of skinny old white men having sex with exotic ethnic women!

"I was born a wee young lad of nineteen years in the humble and unesteemed Joline Hall of Mathey College, Princeton, the dank northwest armpit of campus that silently perspires between regal Rocky and beauteous Blair. “Rafael” was a plain taco shell and by instinct I filled him with lamb’s blood and latkes, the Semitic fare that nourished me in the womb. I penned weekly e-missives for the Jewish Life Center and honed my talent for Internet jest. This hobby aside, my year was relatively uneventful; I opened my eyes once or twice in the spring and by June I could recite the ocean’s ingredients, a childhood interest that I’ve since outgrown like my flannel classwear and my lust for Tower passes. ,At twenty I fell from the crib and stretched my plump limbs and tried my first crawl, and tumbled down the gentle slope to Little where my common room was slightly larger and much more frequently populated, filled with the laugher of inebriated Hebrews whom I now had the confidence to cater and host. I gurgled some more verbiage in History and Letters and found my place in ART, then defected to HIS and remain there today. I secularized and slung jokes now for Tri Club and thus joined my first neighborhood of wordsmiths and humorists, many uncircumcised. I did not bicker but joined Terrace F. with seven friends (of which four remain) and by the end of spring term I felt sufficiently happy at Princeton to wave an old class banner in the alumni parade and converse with the elderly beneath.,Twenty-one, I slid my new license in the window pocket of my new wallet and capably strolled southward, setting up shop just west of the Dinky in a vine-covered wooden floored Matheyesque upperclass dormitory named Pyne. I resided there with J and not with C, the latter my roommate of my infancy and toddlerhood, and unlike C and I who slept side-by-side, J and I resided in a too-cozy bunk bed in a room distressingly cozier. By a stroke of luck I earned the bottom, though those who are not experienced should know that such a victory is Pyrrhic—the low roof of the upper bed obstructs the light fixture and lends your abode an unpleasant cavern-like aura. This year was lonesome and shadowy but highly productive, and my writing flourished in my history courses and in this paper and on three campus stages and in my mother’s heart.,I stand today twenty-two and my home is called Butler where I serve as an assistant residency advisor, though my advisory cannot draw from any personal experience in air-conditioned and indvidually bathroomed and keylessly locked housing, me a newcomer to these pristine conditions just as the wee young lads and lasses are. It is a solitary and monastic home as for the first time my room is mine and mine only and my neighbors are largely unknown and when I close the windows and shades and turn the temperature dial down I can easily believe I am inside a refrigerator, which sometimes comforts and sometimes disturbs but always alienates me from the outside unfavorably. I’ve dipped one toe in a bottomless well labeled Love and another in another labeled Fears About The Future. I try to be kind and I try to be honest. I’ve not done significant writing yet but I’m ready to, and present this meager start.,This is what it means to be a man: It means to stretch your plump limbs and tumble but to clutch your pen and journal tight as you roll, to take notes on the burrs and pine needles that prick you and stick in you all along your path and to document them Darwinesque, to illustrate and annotate their forms and assemble a guidebook of the mind, to read it regularly and develop fluency, and finally to approach a closed-eye wee young lad and point to the vegetables embedded in your skin and expertly distinguish their species.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/honest-ii/,"

"With Sigourney Weaver on campus now, and the illustrious Graham Phillips, and Maggie Sajak, a potential up-and-coming country superstar and daughter of Wheel of Fortune’s immortal host Pat Sajak, in the Freshman class, Princeton has seen an influx of celebrity this year. How do these people fit into the Princeton mix?  And more importantly, how should we go about helping them fit in?,The first tip when encountering a celebrity is that you must approach as if you already know the person.  Give the celebrity the benefit of feeling like a normal person for once. It must be hard to be continually gawked at by all the tourists near Blair Arch like livestock at a county fair, vying for the title of the World’s Fattest Pig.  Give them room to breathe.,Some people recognize Sigourney Weaver for her phoned-in performance in Avatar, but I hold her to a much higher standard, remembering the days of Ghostbusters, Alien, Aliens, Alien3, and Alien: Resurrection.  All right, maybe not the last two, but thankfully those have been erased from most audience’s memories.,Miss Weaver’s recent work on Political Animals is above and beyond many of her other roles throughout her career, proving that Avatar and some of those alien films may just have been a fluke.,Nonetheless, Sigourney Weaver is kicking it here at Princeton, and for that, we can be grateful.  To have someone of her caliber perform on our stage is an honor, just like it was with Katherine Hepburn, Rosemary Harris, Arthur Lithgow, Lewis Black, Frances McDormand, Ruth St. Denis, Ed Asner, and many more in years past.,Last Sunday, which was one of those weird Sundays, when everyone’s slightly (or severely) hung-over from the night before, and depressed about the pile of shit that needs to be done for class, I was graced with the chance to run into Miss Weaver, as she was headed down University Place to the theatre.,“Good luck in the show Miss Weaver!” I said.,A simple, “thanks” was the reply.,Enough, and fair, is how I would refer to our interaction.  I didn’t soak up her time, and in return she gave me a satisfying acknowledgement.  What else do we ask of our esteemed celebrities, except to integrate with society and behave like the rest of us lowlifes?  ,For someone like Graham Phillips, it must be hard to go from a childhood of filming Evan Almighty and The Good Wife to being a regular run-of-the-mill kid at Princeton.  Meeting him took a different sort of technique, one that I call “complete and utter ignorance”.,Let’s be frank: I don’t watch The Good Wife.  I have never seen the show, and probably never will.  Until a couple days ago, I always thought it was analogous to a modern version of Leave It To Beaver with a focus on Mrs. Cleaver.  So, when I met him, he seemed no different than everyone else I awkwardly introduced myself to him during froshweek, (mainly because I had absolutely no idea who he was) and was ripe with the awkward, but essential, questions:,“Oh! Are you a freshman, too?  What res college?  Lucky bastard, I bet you have a huge room in Butler.  Yeah, I’m in Wilson.  Central location?  I know, it’s fucking ugly, kinda like a prison.”,Honestly, the conversation probably sounded totally different, but who’s to say now?  What happens in froshweek stays in froshweek, or in our minds, or so I have been told.,All this reflection on celebrity eventually led me to recall the fact that I do know someone famous on a more intimate level than the alien slayer, or the kid from that Steve Carell sequel that got to high-five a damn elephant.,It reminded me of a family friend of mine, Jordin Sparks: the same one that swept the competition on American Idol a few years back.  We grew up down the street from one another, back in the good old days of seven digit telephone numbers and the nonexistence of Facebook.,For me, her notoriety made no difference, besides the really, really nice clothes she was able to buy.  Whenever she came to town, it was as if she had never embarked on her journey to the ranks of the rich and famous.  So it comes to no surprise to me that Graham and Sigourney are ordinary people, through and through.,So remember kids, when meeting a tall dark stranger that turns out to be Will Smith filming a new thriller that’s hopefully as amazing as I Am Legend at Carnegie Lake, don’t scream and chase after him like the psychotic, Type-A, ivy-league, social moron that you may be.,Instead, give him a laid-back nod and maybe a two finger wave.  See what he does in return; maybe this way you can become best friends, or just get paid a shitload to babysit his kids while he and his wife are filming.,I guess this brings us back to Maggie.  I promise, I will make an effort to find and meet her, if only to prove my hypothesis correct. Who knows? She could end up being the next Taylor Swift.,And Maggie, if you are out there somewhere, reading this article, stuck trying to tune out some boring lecture about the speed of subatomic particles moving along a curved path in a three dimensional field, I would be honored to be able to interview you. ,While none of these people may compare to the greatness and elegance of Audrey Hepburn, who hangs on a wall in my common room, smoking what appears to be the most delicious cigarette I have ever laid my eyes upon, they add something to our campus that nobody else can offer, excluding the Olympians, Poet Laureates, Nobel Prize winners, prestigious authors, Rhodes Scholars, and of course John Nash.  I haven’t quite placed it yet, but one day I will, and I hope it will be worth all the hype I’ve just poured into it.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/princeton-runway/,"

"“Mr. President, they’re ready to see you now.”  ,	“Give me just another minute.  I’m almost done.”  In an otherwise pristine Oval Office, the President’s desk was littered with unread daily briefs, crayon drawings, baseball cards, and candy wrappers.  He had been working very hard on two top-secret letters for the past several hours and was putting the finishing touches on the envelopes.  “Hey Nancy…”,	“Yes Mr. President?” the old woman replied.  ,	“How many B’s in Abbas?  And what’s this Abu Mazen business?”  ,How could things have gotten this bad?  Everything had been going so well. They’d been talking every day; Mahmoud even sent him a care package, this time not via Hamas or Al-Aqsa – they changed their name anyway.  Out of this package came the most enchanting fragrances of the West Bank, thyme and sumac, basil and rosemary, topped off with mint leaves and pomegranates.  And even though the homemade hummus spoiled because the delivery boy got held up at a checkpoint, it’s the thought that counts.  ,	The knot in Ariel’s stomach grew tighter as all sorts of ideas swirled through his head.  He paced about his office, pausing every so often to play a few minutes of Xbox, a much-appreciated Hanukkah gift from George Bush.  But this was no time for fun and games…he missed Mahmoud.  He’d grown used to their nighttime conversations that would sometimes last several hours, and he was looking forward to having him over the following week for his world famous latkes.  Wretched, wretched world!  Who knew what was right or wrong anymore?  He had to give Mahmoud that ultimatum, right?  That’s the only way he would ever change.,“I’m gonna call him,” Ariel said as he picked up the phone, “No…I can’t!”  He bit his knuckle to hold the tears back.,“Don’t call him.  You deserve better than this,” said Lior, Ariel’s close friend and confidante.,“I heard a rumor yesterday that he called me fat.  Why would he do that?  He knows I have body image issues!  This is never going to work out,” Ariel cried, “All his friends hate me!”,A day went by with no phone calls, no text messages, not even a secret signal during a press conference; then another day passed, and another, and another.  Mahmoud lounged uncomfortably on a breezy morning in Ramallah, sipping tea and reading Al-Hayat.  Nothing feels good, he told an aide when he awoke that morning.  He had been so happy with how things were going since that first call from Ariel on that magical Tuesday, just two days after the election.  He was so sweet then.  Now, just a week later, they were strangers.  Mahmoud had found himself in a rut he desperately needed to get out of.  He closed his eyes and recalled those blissful 72 hours.  The world had seemed so wide open, as if they could have accomplished anything together.  He’d even made his mother’s special hummus for Ariel.  How could he have let himself fall so hard so fast?  ,	“I ought to do something to show him I’m still interested,” Mahmoud said, breaking the awful silence that permeated throughout the office.,	“No, you mustn’t!  He’s disengaged,” said his trusted aide Ahmed, “He doesn’t listen to you unless you’re telling him exactly what he wants to hear.  He only listens when it’s convenient.”  Mahmoud had known Ahmed for years and he’d never known him to give poor advice.  ,	“But what am I supposed to do?  I have to do something!”  They looked at each other and immediately said in unison, “The fortune star!”,Ariel stared blankly at the envelope, afraid of what it might contain.  It read, ‘To Ariel, From Mahmoud’ in what looked like a child’s handwriting, complete with the quintessentially youthful backwards ‘e.’,	“You have to open it Ariel,” Lior insisted.  “Remember that Shawshank picture we watched the other night at Avi’s?  You’ve got to get busy living!”  Ariel ripped the end of the envelope and let the note fall into his hand.,“Dear Ariel, I’m so sorry about everything that has happened,” he recited, “Let’s get together and talk.  Meet me at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv a week from today:  Room 204 at 3pm.  I can’t stand things the way they are.  Don’t contact me directly, just come straight there.  If you can’t make it, I understand, but I really want to see you.  Your friend (I hope!), Mahmoud.”,“Okay, pick a number.”,	“Seven…no six,” Mahmoud replied, as he bit his nails nervously.  Ahmed counted aloud as he opened and closed the origami star.,	“Alright, now pick a color,” Ahmed whispered as he looked solemnly at Mahmoud.,	“Green.”,	“G-R-E-E-N.  Okay, now pick another number.”,	“Four.”  Ahmed counted once again and unfolded the paper to reveal the fortune.,	“You’ll never plow a field by turning it over in your mind.”  As Mahmoud pondered the advice, a knock came at the door.  A lanky young man peered in.,	“Mr. Abbas?  This note just came for you.  It’s from Prime Minister Sharon.”  Mahmoud jumped up at once, snatched the envelope and tore it open.  He read:,	“Dear Mahmoud, I’m so sorry about everything that has happened.  Let’s get together and talk.  Meet me at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv a week from today:  Room 204 at 3pm.  I can’t stand things the way they are.  Don’t contact me directly, just come straight there.  If you can’t make it, I understand, but I really want to see you.  Your friend (I hope!), Ariel.”  Just five minutes later Mahmoud was already making travel plans.,The rotund man sat in the narrow chair.  He’d never been so nervous in his life.  He looked at his watch…3:06…where was he?!  He loosened his tie and poured a glass of water for himself.  The door opened.,	“Mahmoud!”  Ariel’s face contorted; he couldn’t hold back any emotion.  “I’m so sorry…” ,“No, I’m sorry.  I never should have…”  Mahmoud paused.  They embraced.,“How about we sit down and talk, ok Ariel?”,	“Sure, you know I’ve been doing a lot of thinking.”,	“Me too Ariel, me too,” replied Mahmoud, “I’m going to dispatch forces to stop attacks on Israelis in Gaza, and I am going to use tougher public language with militant groups.  I just hope that I haven’t sabotaged our relationship.  I’m trying very hard to show you I’m committed.”,	“In good time we will be great friends again, Mahmoud.  But listen, for now, no public high level talks can happen.  Not just yet.  I hope we can continue to have our enchanting phone conversations in the meantime.  And this doesn’t mean our people can’t talk.  We just can’t have an official meeting yet.”  Mahmoud jumped up.,	“I knew it!  You’re ashamed of me!  You’re ashamed to be seen with me in public.  Oh who cares what other people think, Ariel?  It’s just me and you, right here.  This is all that matters,” Mahmoud said as he placed Ariel’s hand over his heart.  Ariel quickly pulled away.?	“It’s not that I’m ashamed!  I have enough problems in my own party over all of this disengagement and cooperation.  Maybe once I can show them some positive results in Gaza thanks to your efforts we can get together in February.”  Mahmoud shrugged.,	“Okay, I guess I can live with that, but your language must also change.  You’ve got to let the Palestinian people know that you are willing to talk with my administration, or else we have no legitimate argument to make against militant violence.  But other than that, I can’t complain.  I’m happy that you invited me in the first place.  I thought you didn’t want…”,	“Invited you?” Ariel interrupted, “Who invited you?”,	“You invited me.  You sent me that wonderful note…you know, ‘I’m so sorry about everything that has happened…’”,	“Let’s get together and talk?!” Ariel finished.,	“Yes that’s the one.”  Mahmoud replied.,	“I didn’t send that, you sent it to me!”,	“Now hold on a second, I didn’t send anything.”,	“Then who did?” Ariel wondered aloud.,“I did, cowboy,” called out a familiar voice.  The two men turned toward the open door and saw that loveable, smirking, do-no-wrong face.  “Hehehe…I’m George W. Bush and I’m reporting for duty…just kidding!  Hehehe…”,“You!”,“George, you pisser!  I can’t believe you did this!”  Ariel cackled.,“What can I say?  It was the only way I could get you guys in a room together.  It was Colin Powell’s idea…I’m almost sorry to see him go now that it worked!”  Ariel and Mahmoud sat shaking their heads, still in disbelief.  They looked at each other and laughed.,“Of all the embassies in all states in all the world, you fellas walked into mine.  I want to thank you for coming.  Now, Mr. Prime Minister, just for coming, I’m going to upgrade that Xbox to Xbox Live and throw in some of my favorite games.  Mr. President, I will see to it that Palestinian cause is mentioned in the State of the Union and has a place in the new budget, and I’ll work with both of you to ensure we prevail.  When you’re ready to come over to Camp David, you let me know and we’ll get it done.  In the meantime check out that Road Map…I’ve got a crisis of my own to take care of back home.”  He then exited after shaking each man’s hand.,“So you really think this could work?”  Ariel began, “Thousands of years of strife, a nightmarish half-century, a vicious Intifada and the unfortunate but necessary crackdowns that have followed…”,“Brutal IDF incursions, restrictive checkpoints, targeted assassinations…” Mahmoud continued, “And we’re going to be the ones to change it all?”,“We’re going to do our best, Mahmoud.  That is all we can do.  I’m no Yitzhak Rabin, but on the other hand you’re no Yasser Arafat, so maybe we’ve got a shot.”,“And if we don’t?”  Ariel smiled.,“We’ll always have Tel Aviv.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/mahmoud_et_ariel/,"

"I like to ask long-term couples where and how they met—always a good remedy to a boring conversation. My best friend met his wife through friends. After the second date, they knew they were going to get married. Recently, I met a couple that met by chance, both driving cross-country, essentially at a gas station in Arizona. A housemate of mine in Jerusalem, a German convert to Judaism, fell in love with the Israeli-Arab woman two floors above us. They are together now. Her family, including her brother, who I worked with in a left-wing political youth group, wants them both dead. Love in the time of backward misogynist cultures. ,Things are never so adventurous for me, despite what you might imagine. It was always the singers and musicians who wooed successfully, not the dancers. Nijinksy only got ambiguity. As a break-dancer, I get bupkes, more or less. ,That’s fine. I’m not looking for my soul mate, or a secretary, just interesting people who might be interested in me. Despite my local fame, this is more difficult than you might think. I’m too poor to date local professionals, too Jewish for Seminarians.  I’m too PhD to date MPPs, and I’m too old to date undergraduates, though Lord knows I’ve tried. ,My friendships with the women in my life are more important to me than sex. Consequently, I rarely make the first move since I don’t want to queer the friendship. An Israeli friend of mine tells every girl he goes out on a date with, “Ehhmm, I am a fem-ee-neest and never make the first move.” Because he’s a cool Israeli, he can get away with that. If I said this, I would be tagged as cowardly. So I Platonically endure with the women friends to whom I am attracted in greater or lesser degrees. I harbor crushes stoically, like in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.,See, I’m a picky eater, and a picky dater. Like Seinfeld, I can write a person out of dateability on the smallest human tics, such as:,Rude to wait-staff,Rude to homeless person,Orders steak,Doesn’t read books,Boring conversation,Curses like a Teamster,Uncurious about Phenomenology,Boyfriend calls during date,Dyes dark hair red,Smokes,Oddly formed mole ,Boyfriend calls after date,Despite this pickiness and the fickle Fates, I do believe that one has a higher chance of meeting compatible lovers when one plans these things out. There is the hellish practice of speed-dating: five minutes to talk to each person in an orgy of first impressions. It’s instrumental rationality at its most embarrassing. In my perfectly ordered world, we would just send resumes, with pictures, to each other. And so, last summer, at the urging of a friend, I tried on-line dating. ,Let me start with the bad. J-Date. The J stands for Jewish. There must be M-Date somewhere, though it would be hard to see what women look like through their veils. I tried to get in on the Bangladeshi dating scene, but I stuck out a bit. Better to convert a South Asian beauty than put up with the lacking creativity of the “chosen” women on J-Date. ,J-Date makes it hard for you to seem anything but ridiculous. The options of categories they give you are inane. “Perfect first date.” Everyone says dinner and a movie. “What you’ve learned from past relationships.” Everyone says communication. The first sentence of your “About Me” paragraph is displayed, along with your age, and picture. Smart marketers will make sure that those first few words are eye-catching and witty. No one does it. Instead, the average first line reads: “Hello! I am a 30 year old attractive, single Jewish woman…” These redundancies are supposed to catch my eye? This marketing mistake usually goes on to say “I love life” or “I love to laugh” or “I live life to the fullest”. I swear, this is what they write! What do these things MEAN? This is why there is a demographic problem in the Jewish community. (My profile says: “Athletic, academic, activist.” No one has contacted me.) ,Every girl on J-Date wants good conversation and someone with a sense of humor. Besides barely able to contain their desire for marriage and children, they secretly want height and deep pockets. Selfish genes. I have composed whole stand-up comedy routines with the aim to seduce, and let me tell you, humor doesn’t work. Women want tall men, not Woody Allen; it is a scientific fact.,On the other side of town… Nerve.com is a web-magazine dedicated to smart articles about sex, erotica, and all that. You can even find Peter Singer’s review of a book about bestiality. Its on-line personals are part of the “Spring Street Network” the same personals linked to other cool websites like NYTimeOut, the Village Voice, The Onion, and Rottentomatoes. (I recommend it for you undergraduates once you leave the seething hothouse of college life and friends-with-benefits.) Nerve.com makes clear what you’re doing. Both parties are intent on some sort of hook-up, preferably a witty, casual, smarty-pants hook-up. From the comfort of your computer, you first get to see what the person looks like, how they write, how they come off on within certain parameters. The categories you fill out are designed for maximum cleverness by professionals (“The five items I can’t live without;” “Favorite on-screen sex scene”), and you can be assured that most people who put up profiles satisfy some minimal hipness requirement. You can then buy credits that enable you to initiate a correspondence via email, or even voicemail. Not wanting to be like that guy in Swingers who second-guesses his own phone messages, I emailed a few interesting profiles, some grad students at Rutgers, a reader of The Nation in Southern Jersey, even a tall blonde in the Princeton-area. All to no avail. Was it my delivery? My breath? Should I have been more formal, more forward, less self-deprecating, less name-dropping? The only person that contacted me was a right-wing lesbian doing research on dating.,Having no luck in a 50-mile radius of Princeton, I reconfigured my profile to NYC. Boy do I love the Big Apple! It is crawling with single left-wing Jewish girls who appreciate an educated, and poor, man. ,The first week I was virtually relocated to the NY dating scene, I met two great people. One was a beautiful left-wing yoga practicing medical student from Ohio. She “interviewed” me. We went swing dancing and had a great time. She was looking for “the right person;” some time after our second date, I got hosed. What was it for? Cursing like a Teamster? Shyness? Honesty? I never found out, alas.,The other person’s profile said “lefty geeks, I want you!” Hey, I thought, I’m a lefty geek. And indeed, she wanted me. Our first date was the Dissent Magazine annual holiday party at CUNY. Over copious wine, we gaped at famous socialist writers like George Packer, Marshall Berman, and Mitchell Cohen. We had a great time, she wasn’t rude to the wait staff, and she made sparkling conversation. A perfect date. ,Wilhelm Reich posited a theory that the reason that fascism caught on in Europe was because men were not having proper orgasms. Today, married couples with children are more likely to vote Republican. Is there a connection? I would advocate a life of childless serial monogamy to fight the forces of evil. Affairs as ordered and regular as a palm pilot are now possible in the age of on-line dating. The net provides an endless, spaceless supply of people potentially interested in you. But what about love?,There is no such thing as “true love” as we imagine it, but plenty of people still put their faith in it. There is endurance, admiration, companionship, and camaraderie, but why look for love? It is epiphenomenal on “compatibility.” The Jewish tradition doesn’t believe in the idea of a single soul mate you were meant to find, but in a soul mate “type.” What better way to target types than by cruising the appropriate on-line dating services? As Linda Hamilton says in Terminator 2, “There is no fate but what we make.” Avoid catastrophe, date selectively.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/irrational_cupid_rational_man/,"

"American vernacular explodes ecstatically, euphorically such that it becomes positively contagious—seeping into our speech patterns, our lives. The use of sexual terms  augments our tendency and predisposition for this vernacular, but it too can be found in other languages.  Ben Johnson himself said: “Language best shows a man; speak that I may see thee,” and methods of speech, the evolution of our language, and more specifically our slang/jargon, displays the identity of our characters, our cultures.,In English we talk about “coming” to describe an orgasm—if we are going to take advantage of our language, go all out, splurge, as it were.  Come again?  It’s just habit, mere inveterate inclination, by now for us to give fair warning (if kind enough) that “I’m going to come.”  We’re already there—that is, we have physically arrived at a placed and charmed or paid (whatever the case may be) to lie in a bed with a partner.  In the comfort of our beds, or our roommate’s bed, or in the chapel, or in the basement of East Pyne, we have come. , And who can forget bawdy bodied Shakespeare with his countless use of “come”? Luckily he only puts words, nothing else, in his characters’ mouths, and as Claudius says to Gertrude, “Come… come away.”  Or in the a sonnet he sexually alludes to the deal that “within his bending sickles compass come.”,But in Spanish, the word “correr” (literally “to run”) describes the orgasmic release.  I’ve heard about quickness; remember, gentleman, it never is a race.  Yet in the Spanish culture, there seems to be a romantic hurry, or perhaps an athletic finish.  There is less emphasis on some sort of spiritual journey of “coming,” but rather more concentration on the act of getting through.  Or at least that seems to be the thrust of it.,French’s colloquial description of the orgasm seems most disturbing in its suggestion that each orgasm takes a little bit of life out of people.  “La petite mort,” or “the little death” (as they call the orgasm stems) from a previous belief that each orgasm removed the life force from people—rather than reinvigorating their energy. This also could suggest a temporary death to pleasure. Apropos and disturbingly connected to this so-called “little death,” most men become erect at the actual time of their demise; this makes this issue hard, quite hard, to discuss.,In colloquially describing the orgasm, Russian emphasizes the finality of coming.  The infinitive “kahnchat,” which means “to end,” elicits giggles from schoolchildren, smiles of pleasure and longing from teenagers, and reflective remembrance from married couples. Indeed, in English we use “to finish” sexually, but it’s still hard to imagine the Tsar Nicholas II calling out to his wife with all the Romanov strength in his family that he is about “to end” as crazy Grigory Yefimovitch Rasputin’s eyes watch on from behind a long, draping window curtain?,Can we imagine some Russian woman, some consummate female named Olga from the Volga (an intensely sexual version of Don Quixote’s Dulcinea del Toboso), with sharp cheek bones, and luscious vermillion lips, drinking vodka in St. Petersburg—all the while screaming repeatedly “cha-choo Kahnchat” (“I want to end”).  , We may speak of etymology and origins trying to discern, but etymology, not entomology, seems to bug me.,French and Spanish stand as Romance languages, and Russian—with its Slavic, Indo-European bent—also can be viewed within the context of Latin.  Russian actually stands most closely to Latin in its use of the colloquial form of orgasm as “in finis” or describes the orgasm to.  But Latin’s infinitive “festinare” (to hurry) seems to call to mind the racing nature of Spanish’s verb “correr.”  “Festinare” more specifically describes the act of approaching orgasm—a time of increased mental, emotional, and physical speed—which brings sense to the rushing, speeding aspect of the word.,Continuing through ancient times, we encounter the Greeks and their use of “mixing” (migumi) to describe the sexual act and more specifically the combination of sexual fluids.  This seems to be an apt linguistic lubricant for a thorough understanding of the concentration on the act of confluence in Greek sex.,Languages seem to accommodate the needs for words—especially those essential categories of love and lust.  Greek, for example, has three well-known words for love.  “Eros,” from which erotic derives, celebrates the erotic, corporeal love, the physical need for combination of bodies about which Sappho wrote.  “Philostes” describes the love of friendship, though it can be euphemistic for erotic love, as when Paris uses this term to go to bed with Helen.  “Agape,” the third form of love, suggests the love for God—an entirely ethereal sense.,If language shows most a man and by extension a culture, we must discover a language with no obvious word for orgasm at all.,Hawaii itself stands as a place of pure, château-bottled paradise, yet it seems that the limits of its language inhibit any word for orgasm.  Only the word “moe,” suggesting the act of making love, exists.  There is no actual word for orgasm. It seems the culture of the archipelago lends itself most easily to an interest in Macadamia nuts.  I am loath to suggest that Hawaiians find or invent a word for orgasm, because there exists enough paradise in that exploding volcanic American state—that state of ecstasy.,In all the combinations of languages, it would make sense to discover how the inimitable Esperanto describes the actual fluid of come. This word “c^uro” to describe human sperm tells us nothing of those who speak Esperanto, yet it seems essential to mention.  In that amalgamation of a language, that hybrid beast of multiple backs, one can imagine dancing away during crepuscular times and launching.,But why all of these different terms?  Why all of this confusion across time zones, borders and oceans?  I advise learning the correct vernacular term of a region so you can scream it out or give far warning if you hope to coordinate and be in sync.  But if you aren’t one for languages or simply aren’t kind enough, just scream, cheer “huzzah,” grip it, and let ‘er rip.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_philology_of_the_orgasm/,"

"I sat. And I waited. And waited. And waited. And, in doing so, I got concerned for the fifth annual Theatre Intime Freshman One Act Festival. The stage lighting shone too brightly and for too long on a set of clashing oranges and teals in a 1960s home. It was already well past the advertised curtain-time and everything looked so haphazard and ragged and asymmetrical and chaotic that I began to fear for my life. Could this be indicative of the overall performance quality of the production that evening? Well, luckily, it wasn’t. And, instead, I was treated to three radically different vignettes this evening that fortunately left me—dare I say—mostly entertained. ,	Contribution, directed by Roger Q. Mason ’08 came first in the line up. Written by the minor African-American playwright and critic Ted Shine, Contribution takes place in the 1960s, on the day of a lunch-counter sit-in. This play—written in a style that could be a cross between Lorraine Hansberry and a Hitchcock movie—interweaves the historical travails of the civil rights movement and those who made their contributions long before it with a narrative that is at times comedic and at others frankly morbid. In this way, the author seems to be attempting to both catalogue and caricature the struggle between the older generations who made it possible for the younger ones to participate and of their different methods of achieving parity in American society. Kelechi Ezie, as Grace Love, does a good job with the role of the tired but fierce grandmother, with an impossibly gorgeous voice, a good sense of humor and a well-maintained geriatric posture and demeanor. Of the three, Contribution felt the most rough around the edges, if only peripherally, like when Grace clutches a pan fresh out of the oven with a bare hand and no sense of pain. More essentially, there is a certain lack of gravitas that the situation of race and generational relations called for, and a lack of tension between the sparring generations of Grace and her grandson Eugene. Furthermore, even though death is a constant theme throughout the play, one never actually fears for or about any character’s life. But Contribution, along with its actors, encompasses a sense of spirit and effort that cannot be dampened by any of the minor weaknesses. ,Set in one of those culturally ambiguous cafés in modern day Los Angeles, Breakfast, by Zipporah Porton and directed by Douglas Laventure ’08, is the second act of the festival. Playing host to a varied set of rude and troubled breakfast guests—ranging from ‘the studio wife’ to ‘the agent’ to ‘the aspiring actress’ to ‘the gay writer’—of the Hollywood industry, the play feels manic and wicked. Most of the actors, whether deadpan or completely over the top, steal their scenes from the playwright and from each other, as each character tries to dominate the other through the different power dynamics that exist within each relationship and within their intertwined lives. Alex Ripp, as a jaded waitress, and Max Rosmarin, as a lascivious agent, are particularly humorless and particularly memorable. However, despite Breakfast’s knowingness about L.A. life, the play’s diagnosis of the ludicrously superficial cultural seems a little too stereotypical (even though one character makes the point that stereotypes do exist for a certain, legitimate purpose). This was a slight fault, however, in an acerbically hilarious and fast-paced show. On the verge of becoming bratty, the last scene cuts sharply at a perfect moment of grounding and exhaustion, before the audience turns on the play the way most characters have turned on each other. ,	Dear Mandy was, wrongly, the book-end of the show. By far the weakest of the three, it was a Sleepless in Seattle variant centered on a narcissistic advice columnist as unlucky-in-love as those who wrote her desperate letters. When one of her flippant columns endorses a particularly unfortunate scenario (the word ‘shrine’ is involved) and brings the male recipient of the bad advice to complain at her proverbial office doorstep, (the supposed) sexual tension of a love-hate relationship ensues with a few complications and a happy ending. The scenario did reek of predictability to the point that, at times, I wondered if Meg Ryan would make a cameo. Moreover, the character of the romantic leads did not help the situation: Molly (aka Dear Mandy) was just too whiny and neurotic; Brian, her love interest, was a wimp. And though, generally, none of the plot and character contrivances and annoyances were the fault of this production, a more innovative—if equally upbeat—play could have been chosen. However, Dear Mandy was almost wholly saved by a few wonderful performances: Max Kenneth as a catatonic dinner date; Janna McLeod as Molly’s witticism-swapping colleague; and Will Ellerbe and Molly Jamieson, who hilariously interposed scenes as different letter readers and wannabe-advisees. In the end, however light-hearted its intentions and its well-meaning attempt, Mandy and her cast of characters became trying in their 45-minute length. ,	Like Dear Mandy, OAF ran for too long. Nearly three hours in length (including intermissions), its sophomority—for lack of a better word—became wearisome; a good effort and sense of energy could only sustain it for so long. It also lacked a constant thread or theme to hold it together. Though the first two acts both explored issues of power relations, I didn’t leave with one thing in mind to explore. OAF also failed to leave me with any new revelations about the generational gap, superficiality, or being Lost in Love, but I did leave feeling as if a few new promising entertainers had emerged. And that was what the festival did best—entertain. With so much college theatre reeking of pretension angst, OAF and its players were refreshing and young and freshman. Besides, they have three more years to become angsty.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/2/,"

"If you’re privy to certain circles, Deerhoof are called the greatest band in the world. If you’re not, you’ve probably never heard of them. My friend overheard a guy call them “Deershit” when they opened for Wilco. In one way or another, everybody’s got a point – Deerhoof are easily the most original, vibrant band playing rock music today and in the current culture of rock, that means they’re playing music for the fringes of a gigantically bored audience.  ,	But prophetic voices sound from the fringes and in this case, the voice of the prophetess is ultra high-pitched and ESL. She sings over a bed of hysterical, violent, giddy, somewhat autistic music.  And she says, “Sense will be hi fi.”,	Deerhoof have the ability to make you want to kick over all the trashcans in your room and hug your little sister for joy. Their new album, The Runners Four, is about twice as long as their previous discs, and uses their joyfully simple sound as a starting point from which to explore songwriting a bit more in depth. All of the classic Deerhoof elements are still in place: the chirping vocals, the unashamed riffing, the drum kits falling down the stairs, the harmonized guitars oversaturated with presence and crackle. But this time the vocal melodies are a little less openly tuneful and a little more coy, the guitar lines fragment where you expect a climax and the jazz textures seem to take a more prominent structural role in more songs. This is Deerhoof stepping out of its role as a fringe band and into its role as a visionary rock band writing songs for the ages.,The result is, like all prophetic statements, radical in how it returns to the core values of the culture to which it speaks. This is music made by a band that has played together for a decade and never lost sight of the gleeful simplicity of rock music. At the end of the day, the most extraordinary thing about Deerhoof is that they don’t require anything more than an open mind and a willingness to be made irrationally happy.

Case in point: this Friday, April 23rd, university administrators – after being tipped off by a misaddressed email – conducted a sting operation on students intending to sell Newman’s Day tee-shirts.

"I really want to like Hellboy.  Not only is it based on a comic book, it’s also about a monster-fighting demon, government cover-ups, and occult Nazi magic.  On top of all this, Hellboy sports some really cool characters, not the least of which is Hellboy himself.  Director Guillermo del Toro also throws some great special effects at us and weaves a promising story.  With this going for it, Hellboy should be a lot of fun, but it still manages to fall flat on its face.,	Hellboy tells the story of a demon summoned into our world by Nazi wizards during World War II.  The FBI takes the creature in, names him Hellboy, and raises him to hunt supernatural monsters.  Flash-forward to 2004 and we meet the adult Hellboy (Ron Perlman), a rude, crude stereotype of rude, crude comic book badasses.  He teams up with Abraham Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), a psychic merman hopelessly reminiscent of Star Wars’s C-3P0.  The supernatural entities steal most of the spotlight, though we do get to know a few humans, including an FBI rookie, Agent Myers (Rupert Evans), and a mysterious woman named Liz Sherman who can light fires with her mind (Selma Blair).,	 Del Toro’s film follows Agent Myers after he is assigned to look after Hellboy.  Almost immediately, the team is summoned to investigate a paranormal creature that eventually plays into a greater scheme involving a band of Nazis and the ancient evil they intend to unleash on the world. Hellboy and his friends soon find that they are the only ones who can save humanity from a nightmarish apocalypse.  On top of all this, both Hellboy and Myers find themselves in love with Sherman, whose mysterious powers begin to rage out of control.,	This is all as cliché as it sounds; in fact, Hellboy comes across as one big, winking cliché.  Myers is the typical rookie agent who must prove his worth, Hellboy is the typical juggernaut with a heart of gold, and Sherman is the typical confused but powerful damsel in distress.  The Nazis, of course, are typically creepy, evil Nazis.  However, this is hardly one of Hellboy’s weak points.  Indeed, the generic comic book characters are part of what makes Hellboy so sleek and cool.  Even though we’ve heard the story about a million times, it’s undeniably fun to watch superheroes fight against evil and tangle with their personal demons.,	Del Toro throws some awesome visuals at us, including Hellboy, who comes across as one big, walking special effect, but doesn’t ever seem overdone.  The good guys’ base, the secret FBI Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, is wonderfully cool.  Replete with occult artifacts and mysterious gadgets, it does for Hellboy what Dr. Xavier’s school did for X-Men.  Even the bad guys— including a gasmask wearing Nazi masochist ninja and the reincarnated Rasputin— radiate cool.  Furthermore, most of Hellboy’s catchphrases and one-liners come across really well.  In short, del Toro has obviously gone to great lengths to create a movie that feels like the comic book that it is based on.,	However, Hellboy loses its stride at its halfway point.  Although it opened with an interesting story, some cool combat sequences, and a great comic book feel, del Toro’s film soon becomes trite and forgettable.  Why?  Quite simply, del Toro neglects the first rule of action movies: thou shalt never let thine audience get bored.  It’s fun to watch Hellboy wreak havoc on his foes for about half an hour, but he quickly runs out of tricks to pull out of his hat.  This results in a series of monotonous action sequences that deserve to be much cooler than they are.,	Blame it on The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, but most of Hellboy’s fight scenes feel tired and underdone.  Hellboy doesn’t even fight with any cool super powers.  His fists and guns are big and nasty, but they’re nothing we haven’t seen before.  On top of all this, many of Hellboy’s fight sequences are dominated by CGI rendered monsters running around the screen causing trouble until Hellboy finds some way to defeat them.,	The X-Men movies succeeded because they featured interesting characters, cool special effects, and a solid comic book plot, not to mention great action sequences. In general, I’m a sucker for superheroes and all their drama, which might contribute to why Hellboy is so disappointing.  Even though I’m not familiar with the Hellboy series, a story full of Nazis, demons, Lovecraftian gods, and freaky psychic powers makes for an awesome premise. However, Hellboy fails because it completely puts form over function.  In this field, it’s not alone.  Recent movies like Underworld, Big Fish, and The Passion of the Christ have tried to carry stories based solely on atmosphere and visual presentation.  While these films have had various levels of success, all three have felt a little too overloaded with striking visuals that cover weak plots.,This seems to be indicative of a particularly disturbing trend in pop culture over the past few years.  Ever since grunge died in 1994, America has become obsessed with appearing pretty and clean.  Take for example the pop revolution of the late 90’s.  It didn’t matter how bad the music was if it was marketed with a pretty face and poppy beat.,This trend has gotten even nastier as the culture wars have intensified over the past few months.  The Martha Stewart trial was less about her being guilty as sin as it was about her being a household icon for cleanliness and perfection.  People don’t want to accept that celebrities have dirty mouths and provocative bodies, so they get the FCC to crackdown on profanity. As the 2004 election, nears, most of the big issues are more about appearances than substantial issues.  The gay marriage debate, for example, is as much about social appearances and recognition as it is about equal rights and morality.  Similarly the debate over “Benedict Arnold CEO’s” is not so much about employment and economics as it is about trying to appear wholesome and American.  It seems to me that America has become increasingly addicted to its self-assurances that everything is A-OK.,If people want their lives to be picture perfect, that’s one thing, but I won’t stand for movies that manage to suck despite being so visually interesting.  Form and function (or image and substance) need to go hand in hand, like in Quentin Tarantino’s latest, Kill Bill Vol. 1, which oozes visual splendor but still manages to pull together an exciting storyline. Tarantino’s original, unforgettable fight sequences are as important to his film as his snappy dialog and self-indulgent Sonny Chiba worshipping.  No matter how many times action fans watch Kill Bill, they can never, ever possibly get bored.,This is much more than I can say for Hellboy.  Although it has one of the coolest premises ever, it eventually becomes just another action movie.  If you’re a diehard Hellboy fan, you’re bound to love it, but del Toro offers little else for the rest of us.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/hellboy/,"

", Nick Cassavetes’s new guns-‘n’-posses yarn, is predictably bad.  That is to say, it fails where one might expect it to fail: cuts are alternately languid and meth-fueled, the dialogue stilted or overly gangish.  In case you’re wondering, Justin Timberlake adds little to the production, but he doesn’t hamper it, either.  Like the other characters, he’s mostly just along for the ride—until he has to cap a kid.  Then he , freaks.,The film begins with a stultifying three-minute montage of baby videos, set to Eva Cassidy’s cover of “Somewhere over the Rainbow.”  Ms. C. died of melanoma in the mid-nineties, and her rendition manages to strip away what little subtlety the original possessed.  So why the name-check?  Because, in Cassavetes’s mind, this slice of SoCal vice-porn ,.  It’s the anti-Oz.  Message: High Life invariably dissipates into, well, something less glam.  The director’s over-the-toppery works, I argue, on a more profound level.  The plot’s worthless, but the movie is ,.  It’s smarter than it lets on.,I’m getting ahead of myself.,Let’s examine the cast.  We first meet Bruce Willis’s Sonny Truelove, father of Johnny Truelove, Claremont’s A-1 dope-pusher.  Bruce has liver spots galore and one of the fakest fake foreheads in the history of cinema.  He chain smokes (more on that in a tick), and he’s being interviewed.  Maybe Johnny sells a little reefer, Sonny says, but he’s an OK kid.,Next we find young True, Timberlake’s Frankie, and a few other meatheads pumping iron.  Elvis, presumably the newest goon in the goon-clique, has been at it all day, mowing the lawn, trimming the hedges.  He wants a brew and a go at the lat machine.  But Johnny’s pissed and Frankie means business—get out and scrub the cars, they scream, and if you finish early, do it again.  E-man’s psychology might as well be tattooed on his enormo triceps.  He’s got something to prove, and he’ll do anything—ANYTHING—to prove it.,There’s so much more—Jake Mazursky (played by , alum Ben Foster, who should know better) owes Johnny T. a boatload of cash; his fifteen-year-old brother Zack is fed up like whoa with Sharon Stone’s overbearing mom figure; Mr. Mazursky can’t keep giving his elder son the cabbage he needs.  After crashing True’s party with nothing in his pockets, Jake and the boss are at loggerheads, and twenty minutes later old Jakey’s bashing windows and taking a dump on the TV room rug.  Johnny wants to get back, and when he sees Zack on the streets, he kidnaps the kid.  Frankie and some other dudes you might meet at a Slipknot concert become the babysitters.,The film’s midsection has a spring-break-at-Daytona-Beach feel, complete with cheap booze, cheaper-looking danger-babes, and loads of bass.  Zack loves captivity; this is Stockholm Syndrome without the initial friction.  Frankie even offers to let him go, before things start to heat up.  But why leave?  There’s tail in his future, obvi, and life on the fringe is alluring.  The only hitch comes when True phones a lawyer and finds out that kidnapping has its consequences.  The crew could end up in San Quentin forever.  Do they risk letting Zack go?,The answer, of course, is a semi-automatic HELL NO—Elvis wants to be a pal, remember, and Cassavetes needs dearly to put his guys on the run.  True’s the smartest, ditching his lady and bouncing around Latin America, probably kiting checks.  He’s caught, though, like the rest of them.  Here everyone gets his just desserts.  But I said this schlock-fest had something to offer, right?  Well it does: three things, to be exact., True smokes overhand, angrily.  He sucks in hard, too, leaving a trail that curls around his nose.  From Willis’s scene onward, we know these aren’t just cigs—they’re cultural currency.  Your chick smokes after sex (or after an attempt at sex; Johnny’s less dependable when on the lam).  You kick a bate at parties, or when you’re talking business with the boys, or when you’re in a real bind.  No coincidence, then, that T. and Frankie share one as the former pitches the murder idea. , says the Marlboro, ,Cinema’s had its fair share of dramatic smokers.  But there’s a certain amount of discomfort in the way ,’s heavies go about it.  Fact is, Frankie and True started the habit the way Zack did: an older dude offered to hang a nail with them, they went outside, talked pussy.  No one is born a smoker, and to Cassavetes, no one is really , one.  Cigarettes embody life’s bigger road-blocks—in the smoke we compartmentalize our anguish, reduce it to something more manageable.  Then we go about our day, being chummy or eating healthily, figuring it all balances on a cosmic rap sheet.  These are folks who obsessively track the right thing or the wrong thing, yet their ethical calculus never really transcends the stuff of middle-school playgrounds. ,.  Oh shit yes, the three-way.  Hate to break it to you, but Zack loses his flower to two chicks in a pool.  All three hop in naked; big-eyed gal no. 1 blindfolds him, and they play a bit of Marco Polo.  Tellingly, though, our dude finds one (the legitimate romantic interest) without managing to alienate the other.  She’s content with her sideline-chick status, and so they all have a make-out session onscreen.  A shy cut-away goes on to say that they’re doin’ it. ,A problem arises: Zack’s actually crushing on the first.  She knows it, too, but it takes the other blonde to kick-start the night.  Is our victim just an opportunist?  Cassavetes stresses the nature of the male conquest—what’s more important, both for the boy and the big-eyed gal, is the ,, the construction of the man.  Ms. Crush is happy to share the wealth, and her friend is obliging, because both understand the situation’s profundity.  ,  We’ve a feeling, too, that Zack might not last the night, and the enterprise is tinged with despair.  The hero’s battle preparation—an epic trope thousands of years old—is here perverted; fresh off his first sexual experience, Zack hops in a car and promptly, cheerfully rides to his death.,Sharon Stone, resplendent in her fat suit, speaks.  , she sobs, ,.  Cassavetes has done little to develop her character; in the first couple acts she is mostly a mouth, then a (literally) pushy mom.  She’s up in her husband’s, her stepson’s, and everyone else’s grill, and we believe Zack when he says she’s a loving gal.  There’s just no reason to ,.  This interview, painful in its intimacy, makes about as little sense as Sonny’s, at the beginning of the film.  Simply put, Sharon is ludicrous, the scene cringe-inducing.  The worst aspects of the , confession booth are here writ large, and the director, knowingly or unknowingly, gives them their full due.  After all, what do we truly enjoy about reality television?  The experience-as-simulacrum?  Or the damning banality of Joe Sixpack ,Indeed, , distils more than a few aspects of the PoMo predicament.  When Zack begs for his life, we don’t feel sorry for him—we want him to shut his yap.  The film is shocking, but not when it intends to be.  The director could line up twenty fifteen-year-olds and have his way with them.  He could add pit bulls, toss some crank in, double the gratuitous, meaningless sex and violence.  But none of that would match the work’s subconscious.  True twitches as if burdened by the camera; Frankie painfully laughs at his own jokes.  This is a movie that knows it is being watched.  The fictional catastrophe, ridiculous in its own right, gains gravity in transmission.  We consume it.  ,And in doing so, we confront our reflection.  Our own eyes, like Stone’s or Willis’s—bleary, blood-shot, lifeless.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/combing_through_the_idogpilei/,"

"What deranged group of people would spend its entire vacation taking a course where the requirements include standing in or near a below-freezing creek for hours, and later learning about ailments that range from entopic pregnancies to patella dislocations to legs impaled by tree branches?,Princeton students, that’s who.  Thirty-five of them, no less.,Admittedly, I was among those of somewhat questionable mental status who signed up for the University-sponsored Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course that took place during intersession.  The course trains students to administer to anaphylaxis (which is a result of hypersensitivity to foreign drugs), perform CPR, and give basic life support in the wilderness.  Most Princeton students who become “WFRs” are either the crunchy, gorp-eating types who work with Outdoor Action, or the ambitious sort who intend to go to medical school.  Whatever the motivation, we all piled out of Saturday morning exams and into vans to make the trip up to The Princeton-Blairstown Center. ,The moment the first class started, I knew I was in for a rough week.  The course seemed to be made up of an unending stream of homework, lectures, drills, and simulations.  What’s worse, the teachers used acronyms or code names for everything—for example, instead of crying for help, we were instructed to shriek “peanut butter,” instead.  The terminology used in lecture was so foreign to me that, by passing, I might as well have been fulfilling a language requirement.  But passing was another issue:  between all the acronyms and code words, the teachers managed to slip in references to failing the course with amazing frequency.  My mind, still fresh from its “I’m going to fail my first semester” form, soon slipped into its “I’m going to fail WFR” mode.  ,On top of that, students would ask oodles of mind-numbing, time-consuming questions, and the teachers would torture us further by putting up rather gruesome pictures of ailments and injuries in the slide shows.  As if that weren’t enough, the teachers ended the first lecture by reminding us that the stoves heating our cabins would turn off in the middle of the night.  Who doesn’t love the woods in the winter?,The homework itself wasn’t really such a big problem; rather, , the actual assignments proved most daunting. The only way to read in the dark cabin is to use a headlamp, a harsh white light bulb that attaches to your head. While great for searching for a place to relieve oneself in the middle of the night, headlamps aren’t really meant for reading—the blinding light, which bounces back off the white pages into your eyes, feels like it burns holes in your retina.  I was tempted to scream “peanut butter!” any time the lights went out and the headlight went on.,But what really began to induce ASR (Acute Stress Reaction) for me were the drills. Half of the class would be carted outside and given a patient profile.  The instructors might drip blood—which smelled suspiciously like dish soap—on our hands and tell us to run around screaming and limping.  They could also give us the head of a lollypop to “choke” on.  The other half of the class would then walk out to rescue the patients., I don’t know if it was the cold air hitting my face or the fact that I had begun to sleep with my eyes open during lecture, but the second I would walk out to help the victim, my mind would always go completely blank.  Caring for a patient who is freaking out is hard enough; when your mental sanity has been compromised by a week in the woods, it’s even harder. ,But nothing I encountered during the week was quite like simulation.  These “disaster situations” were specifically assembled so that everyone involved pretends to have several terrible ailments.  An example of a hypothetical situation we encountered goes something like this:  while setting up camp for the night a bear comes in and mauls a camper.  Another camper is so shocked and distracted that he allows the stove to blow up, giving him respiratory burns.  The explosion causes a branch on a tree to fall on another camper and impale him.  This branch just happens to have a beehive on it, so three campers are now in anaphylactic shock, but there are only two doses of Epinephrine available.  One is these is being hoarded by another patient who is convinced that he is allergic to all bees and is going into shock even though he is perfectly fine. You get the picture.  As we learned, there are always too many problems and never enough resources.  Plus, all problems must be dealt with in real time, so simulations can last up to two hours—in 14-degree weather.  Unfortunately, the patients then must speak up and explain that they aren’t supposed to have hypothermia for the simulation—they just literally can’t stop shivering.  ,By the end of the week the group had turned into a chorus of sniffling and coughing healers and victims.  I used my newly attained knowledge to diagnose my classmates with respiratory complications secondary to mild hypothermia.  Even though we anticipated many cases of bronchitis for the class, we did not beg for a warmer setting.  The wild had toughened these newbie WFRs, even if we weren’t shy about using a giant Purell pump early and often.,Throughout my training I was nauseous, cold, stressed and tired, and I felt like my mental health was quickly deteriorating.  Looking back, though, I realize I was lucky.  But why?  Was it that I was learning something that could actually be useful?  Or because I was bonding with a great group of kids over battle wounds and the pride of surviving the course?  Perhaps it was the suhweet tee shirts?  Maybe the long hours and hard work involved in the WFR course beat in my mind and body, but I realized that, as I returned to the real world of second semester, I would be allowed no more practice runs or simulations, and I certainly wouldn’t be able to sleep during class with my eyes open, at least not as easily.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/girl_gone_wild/,"

"Title: Hal vs. Hal,Author: Harold G. Parker, III & Harold T. Pratt, IV,subtitle: Television Matters,CC: ,Dearest IV,,American poet Carl Sandburg called TV the “idiot-box.” This is the only thing I learned in 5th grade. Now I think Carl Sandburg is an idiot-box. However, the fact remains that television is a thing oft-maligned from every quarter. Calling it coarse, vulgar, shallow, dumbed-down, stultifying, corrupt, hyper-violent, hyper-sexualized, etc., people find in television the signal and engine of contemporary depravity. TV has become a declinist hobbyhorse for the nudniks at the Parents’ Television Council and like-minded organizations to lament the downfall of culture and compare us to Rome and shit. According to professional quisling Dinesh D’Souza, author of the recent book , it’s TV that made the Moors bomb us.,I refuse to let TV be slandered any more. It’s time we all gave TV some credit for being pretty great. If it tends to come under unusual censure, it’s because people detect in television the mirroring of the flaws of an age. In the words of Lucille Bluth, “They create a monster, and then they call you one.” Its defects are our own – the vulgarity, insipidity, superficiality, cloacal-obsession, yes; but so are its virtues – the world-eroding sarcasm, restive ingenuity, basic optimism, and inexhaustible esprit.,Anyway, so I’m putting it to you: is there value in television? Or is it all just crap? How contend ye?,yours-in-christ,,III,Esteemed III,,It’s valuable crap. Guano, if you will. Whatever artistic or cultural value there is in TV is present as a vehicle for advertisements.,I mean, for instance, pop music has had a pretty consistent cycle of underground-gets-big-gets-crappy-gets-replaced for as long as one can identify pop music as such- but where’s indie TV? Who would watch lo-fi TV when there’s , or , (disclaimer, I only watch those two shows)? I suppose this is sort of HBO’s niche, but not really. Rome has better production values than anything else I’ve ever seen on the small screen, and it boggles the mind to consider the salaries of characters in , or ,.,So, if I agree with you that TV is nothing if not a physical manifestation of the mores of the age (what isn’t? Especially in an age of materialism!), I’m reluctant to assign it ‘value.’ Not because it can’t be valuable, but because the value is only in the interaction of the viewers with one another. Do I care that Andy’s cell-phone is in the office ceiling? No, but I would totally do that if I worked with a douche bag. I don’t really care if Jack Bauer dies next week (they really ought to keep Kiefer Sutherland’s contract extensions more secret); I like it when me and my , friends are sitting in my room, finishing a Triumph growler and playing our semi-elaborate, actually just drink-whenever-crazy-shit-happens game. ,If modernity is disenchantment and the devaluation of the individual in the face of progress, then TV is both a sign of the age, and a salve, a reprieve more engrossing than music (if inferior), and less demanding (and expensive!) than the cinema. Now, whether we all deserve a reprieve, or if that isn’t just enabling the crowds on their way to Gehenna, I don’t know. Do producers have a moral imperative to consider the effect of their product on their viewer? How fatuous and amusing is the prohibition on tobacco advertisement, and the ubiquity of alcohol?,yours-eating-christ,,IV,Dearest IV,,While I think it’s important to never lose sight of the profits-imperative when talking about television, I also think the “vehicle for advertisements” explanation of the cultural value resident in television is only slightly less absurd than explaining , as a prize-winning vehicle. ,, for one, has cultural value independent of all moneymaking concerns. In fact, I wonder if advertising even “works” in the narrow sense of provoking purchase of the thing advertised. I can’t think of any good or service I’ve ever bought because I saw an ad for it on TV.,Rather, it seems like the point of the average commercial is more along the lines of “brand-building” – a nebulous attempt to raise one’s cultural stock by trading on the perceived exchange value of the scheduled program; however, said program’s exchange value ultimately devolves upon the perceived exchange values of its enlisted advertisers. To steal a page from Adorno and Baudrillard, everything has become an advertisement for itself, a ploy to get its exchange value up relative to other cultural goods, to flaunt whatever’s hot in a vain attempt at osmosis. Culture has become one big incestuous tangle of mutual implication. Witness the endless self-promotion of the networks and the virtual disappearance of musical videos from MTV. Nowhere is the desperation of exchange value more evident than on pop radio stations claiming to play “all today’s hits.” What could that phrase even mean?,You bring up a really great point regarding the group viewing of television fundamentally altering its character. That is so true – all of my best TV memories have been watching something with a bunch of other people. If you wanna be all intellectual about it, the group atmosphere of joking and incisive commentary allows room for abstraction and critique. But more importantly, it saves bad television from itself. The quality of the show is immaterial. Anything is watcheable if you’re watching it with the right people. What kind of person watches , alone? What would the point be?,One last thing:	I seriously despise the anti-tobacco zealots who got cigarette ads taken off the air. I would laugh if they all developed lung cancer (OK, not really). They must have the strange conceit that temptation can be excised from the world if only you scrub the temple-walls long and hard enough. Down with the sterilization of public life! Banish nicotine Jack….,by the blood of christ,,III,Esteemed III,,I tend to over-value ads. My dad’s in the industry, you see, so I’ve always had a heightened appreciation for them. Done well, they’re really amazing things, and while I partially share your suspicion of brand building (mostly because so much of it is done so poorly) it’s objectively true that it works. Madison Ave. is a $150 billion-a-year industry for a reason. Anyways, I imagine when 60 robots will do everything, all we’ll do, really, is make ads to sell things to the other people making ads, and occasionally get killed by terrorists who hate freedom and commercials. I may watch , too much.,I think it’s terribly telling that there are no tobacco ads on TV, and yet one can find tobacco being smoked on TV with exceedingly little effort. After all, as the believer in ads, I’m also a big believer in the value of product placement and most of the time, when you find cigarettes on TV, the person smoking them is pretty smoking, too. It’s wonderful free advertising for the industry. ,My point is that, even outside of the ads, TV acts as an ad for something. Are your favorite post-modernists (is Adorno post-modern? Does post-modern even mean anything vis- à-vis the Frankfurt School?) right that everything, TV included, is an ad? No, I don’t think so, what is going to a jazz club selling me, or reading Philip Roth? There is still a distinction between art and ad.,I don’t know exactly what it is, but I know TV falls on the ad side. Maybe not all the time (I’ve never seen ,. I’ve been told I’m a bad person for this reason), but often enough that I’m willing to say that TV is advertising, and the exceptions are just that. You can’t defend something for its exceptions, especially when the exceptions are not only atypical, but constitutionally different. TV is , for advertising- commercial breaks, fixed program lengths, plot-arcs forced to fit in that length. And of course art can happily exist in even the most painfully restricted forms, but it’s inhabiting a form which is inhibiting. So why bother with it?,Or, in the spirit of the age, why not just wait for the DVD, pretend it’s a really long movie, and do a neat end-run that Thorpe would be proud of around the hawkers in the temple? Or TiVo, or YouTube? Actually, don’t. The death of TV presages the birth of the final media, which subsumes all of our present forms, unifies their delivery, and, since ads work, means that ads are ,. And then I’ll have to hate my streaming e-book of Hesse for having Aflac ads.,this-message-has-been-brought-to-you-by-the-infinite-grace-of-christ,,IV",http://www.nassauweekly.com/hal_v_hal/,"

"April 29th, 2006, approx 1:15 PM – 3:45 PM,Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ,Tim Nunan: So, I’m just going to get this little list of questions.,Freeman Dyson: Good.,TN: I remember – I was just curious with language stuff – I remember reading that you knew Russian, you know Russian?,FD: Well, sort of as badly as I know German.,TN: When did you eventually learn Russian?,FD: Well, I did it in high school. I was always interested in Russian. And the joke was that – I mean, this was during World War II, I was in high school – and I was very, I sort, I fell in love with language and I decided I would go to Russia after the war was over and study. And so, I was all planned to spend three or four years in Russia and study science – of course, they were very good in science – and also just to get thoroughly immersed in the language. So, that is what I was looking forward to at the end of the war. And then, of course, it turned out, at the end of the war, that things rapidly went downhill and we stopped being friends with the Russians, and so it became politically impossible, and so then, just sort of, as a second choice was the United States. And so I came here instead.,TN: And that was to Cornell at first?,FD: Yes. It’s amusing to think what would have happened if I had actually gone –,TN: Anyway, I remember this somewhat bizarre – maybe a little disturbing for the policymakers of the time – a lot of the writings around the early 60s, I suppose when you were looking into the test-ban stuff, it seemed , I mean, that a lot of your analysis of Khrushchev, it seemed to come from having read Russian literature. You talked, I think, a lot about Russian attitudes towards war a lot –,FD: Yes.,TN: Looking at ,–,FD: Right. And in a way, it’s kind of – maybe disturbing – I kind of got the impression that not a lot of defense analysts were, were looking at the culture so much…Well, of course, it’s even worse now when they have to deal with the Arabs. They don’t understand anything at all about the Arabs.,TN: Yeah, there’s like a huge, huge push, I know, to – if you’re like an Arabic speaker or, you know, if you’re going to major in Near Eastern Studies – something like that, they’ll certainly be willing to pay your way, to some degree.,FD:  Yes. No, I remember I was in Moscow a couple of years ago and stayed with an old friend there. And he has two boys, and both of them in college, and the older one, who is doing very well, is studying Arabic.,TN: And, I know at Princeton at least, our Arabic course offerings have, you know, like, quintupled since 2000.,FD: (laughs) Yes. But, still, the people in charge still don’t understand it.,TN: I was just going to ask about Cornell stuff at first. I was just reading ,. You write at one point that you could feel this vivid presence, because a lot of the people had just come from Los Alamos. And I think you wrote too, that a lot of them had had this sort of exuberance about them when you were first at Cornell.,FD: Yes. ,TN: I guess, could you explain, what characteristics was this exuberance marked by? And also, I remember that you wrote that some of these people – you got the impression – had had a lot of fun –,FD: Yes.,TN:  — building the bomb. Could you comment on what sorts of things led you to that?,FD: Well, partly it came from my own experience in the 50s when I was a nuclear engineer. So I spent the year building a reactor, and also then a couple of years later, I worked on the spaceship, which you may have read about. I mean those were, for me, really exhilarating times, when working on a project where you were doing something real, and with a whole lot of people it didn’t matter who got the credit, and it was just a joyful time. And it was also like a camping trip – I mean, that you were away from your usual habits.,TN: Sort of – I think, what is it, more of an engineering-type atmosphere, you found?,FD: Yes. Yeah, it was a team effort and it’s like team sports. They are much more absorbing than individual sports, in a way.,TN: Did you ever draw a distinction between – did you ever see there being, I don’t know, a moral distinction between having fun working on an atomic bomb and having fun working on a reactor?,FD: Yes. Always did, definitely. I mean, I didn’t blame these people because I could very well have been in their shoes. But clearly there should have been a difference. And there wasn’t.,TN: Did you ever have a conversation with – I think I’m going to mispronounce this name – but Hans Bethe?,FD: Hans Bethe. Oh, yes, we talked with him a lot. I mean, that was the joy of arriving at Cornell as a student and finding that the students went to lunch with Hans every day. I mean, we called him Hans –,…,TN: But did you ever – so did you ever have a sort of conversation with Bethe or the other physicists?,FD: Yes.,TN: Did you ever challenge them on that they had had fun there? Or did they ever have any remorse for having enjoyed this a lot?,FD: No. I don’t think so, and I mean, of course, as – they all believed that the bomb had won the war, and that was enough justification, and if it had been true, I mean I would certainly go along with that. Only more recently I came to doubt it and –,…,TN: With this idea of having fun, though, did you – did you ever see a distinction between the attitude that someone like Bethe had had, working at Los Alamos, with, maybe the vigor that someone like Teller would propose weapons systems. I mean, I didn’t know him, of course, but it seems, having read about Teller a lot, he seems to have this sort of, maybe exuberance or real passion for pushing for weapons systems, whether it be – I mean, one example is, there’s this photo we have of him hugging the model of the Soviet Tsar Bomba, the biggest, you know, that fifty-seven megaton thing. And there’s this picture of him, you know, gesturing next to it. So, I’m curious, did you ever see a parallel between the fun these people had at Los Alamos and maybe the fun that, at least it seems, that Teller may have had?,FD: No, on the contrary, no. Of course, I did work with Teller on the reactor. He was, in fact – I mean, we were very, very close at that time. He was, in fact, the moving spirit of that reactor which we were building, so I was seeing him every day at that time. He was, of course, a wonderful person to work with because he just had this great enthusiasm – it didn’t matter whether it was a reactor or a bomb – for him, it was all good fun. And in both cases, I mean, he thought he was doing something good. I mean, the reactor, as it turned out, was rather good. It’s never given any trouble and it actually is useful.,TN: Triga, right?,FD: Yes. And he felt the same way about the hydrogen bomb, that it had actually kept the peace, and that it was a sensible thing to do, and the Russians would have done it anyway, all of which I think are true, in a way. So I don’t blame Teller for that. I think the problem at Los Alamos, in a way, is a bigger problem, because the bomb they designed actually was used. And— ,TN: Whereas in the—,FD: —whereas the ones Teller designed were not. So that was more good luck than good judgment, but still.,TN: Did you ever have any discussions with Teller about Star Wars in the 80s? ,FD: Yes, oh, a lot.,TN: What were some of the content of those? I think I remember reading in 1983, at least, when you had written ,, you seemed to not be a big fan of Star Wars or SDI then?,FD: Well, I always believed in it politically, not technically. It was one of these things, I thought from a moral point of view and a human point of view, it was a good idea, that we should switch from an offensive to a defensive strategy. That was something that was, in the long run, very desirable. I still think so. Problem was, that the program was technically just – well, it was actually fraudulent. (laughs),TN: I think there’s a quote by this fellow Ronald Powaski, who, I think, is a nuclear historian, and I think he describes Star Wars as, I think the product of too many Americans pumping quarters into video game machines.,FD: (laughs),TN: Do you agree with that?,FD: Yes, it’s true enough. It was a mixture of a whole lot of things. Star Wars was basically just a source of money for all kinds of people with different ideas who came into the foreground to get their share. So parts of it were actually quite sensible and parts were not. But, the most interesting experience I had was going with Teller to talk to General Abramson, who was the boss of Star Wars – that’s probably in one of the books, also – anyway, so, Teller and I went together because we both agreed that if this program was to be any good, it had to be declassified. Because Teller was always against secrecy, and so was I, so that was something we agreed on very strongly. So we talked to the general, and told him that this program was just not getting anywhere, and the reason was that because it was all hidden behind walls of secrecy and nobody knew how lousy it was. And if you wanted to do something useful, the first thing was to declassify it and have it honestly criticized. And anyway, so the general then gave us a big speech, said, oh yes, he completely agreed and that just next week he was going to declassify this and that and was – of course, never happened. (laughs),TN: (laughs) And was that the end of your Star Wars politico experience?,FD: Yes. So, for me it’s always been sort of a missed opportunity. I think there could be a good program, but we’ve never had one. And certainly the existing program—the present-day program—is even worse than it was then.,TN: I recall reading, too, I think with missile defense – well, one thing I was inferring, perhaps too much, from your writing, is, when you’re talking about shelters, one of the points seemed to be to me was… in Switzerland they have a national more defensive culture, where shelters, no one takes them as a sign that the Swiss are suddenly going to unleash nuclear Holocaust on us. But in the case of America in the 70s or 80s, shelters could be construed as this effectively offensive backup. Do you feel that the political climate has changed enough since, say, the 1980s, when Star Wars was first being bandied about, that ABM systems are now sort of more acceptable?,FD: No, on the contrary. I mean, things are far worse now. I mean, this Bush notion of preventive war, I think, is an abomination. I mean, to me, that’s a huge step backward. In fact, I just wrote this morning a manifesto to the ,to that effect. You can have a copy of that, too, if you like. It’s only half a page. But—no, that, to me—anything Bush does, whether it’s ostensibly defensive or offensive, if you combine it with preventive war, then clearly—,TN: It’s going to have that undertone.,FD: Well, it’s more than an undertone (laughs). It’s an – it’s clearly part of a scheme for conquering the world. I find that – I’m really scared in a way that I had not been in twenty or thirty years.,TN: Just in general, or with regard specifically to, say, nuclear weapons? ,FD: Well, I mean, it’s not just Bush himself but the large section of the American public seems to go along with idea that America has a God-given mission to invade countries and try to organize the world as we see fit. And that seems to me terribly dangerous, and in the end, I mean, if we go on like that, we’ll come into collision with China or some big country, and, the nuclear weapons then probably will then start exploding all over the place. The nuclear weapons are still there.,TN: Yeah.,FD: So that seems to me far more dangerous than anything else we’ve done.,TN: I was curious, to get back up to this notion of fun, and I guess nuclear weapons in general. There was a third episode that I’m curious if you could comment on. Somewhere you had, also from the 80s, you describe this experience where you went in and talked to a SIOP (Single Integrated Operational Plan) colonel, I think it was, you know, has his maps, I suppose, up, and you were describing how he talked about his plans and what they would do in the event of a war, and how he seemed to eventually have this sort of maybe glee or his happiness about him, when describing the plans for war. Do you see that type of fun or zeal as different from Teller’s or a Bethe’s at Los Alamos?,FD: Yes. Yes, I think so, because, I mean, Teller understands very well, that the purpose of hydrogen bombs is not to be used. And that’s absolutely – that’s basic to Teller’s point of view. The whole point was to make the bomb so powerful that they would never be used. And that’s –I think that’s a consistent point of view – it may not be right but, anyway, at least it makes a certain amount of logic to it.,TN: Maybe this explains why he was hugging the fifty-seven megaton one.,FD: Yes. I mean, I remember I told that story, in the book I guess, about my brother-in-law, who—I don’t know if you happened to have read that.,TN: Not sure if I remember something –,FD: Anyway—I mean, my brother-in-law was a soldier with the German army in Russia and then, in later life, he was sitting in a pub drinking beer and reminiscing about the war and how great it had been, how wonderful those years were when he was in Russia, and – “If it wasn’t for your damned hydrogen bombs we’d be back there today!” (laughs) And there’s something to that. The hydrogen bomb really did put a stop to that kind of thing. And I think one can be proud of that, in a way. That’s certainly Teller’s view. That’s rather different from what Bethe was doing – I mean, Bethe was in the middle of a war and he was just building a weapon that we could use in a very desperate war were people were being killed every day, and if you were to bring the war to the end, that would be great. Which was a very different situation. In both cases, I think, it may be an illusion.,…,TN: So, I guess I’d like to move to just asking about when you first came to the Institute. I suppose it was in the late ‘40s, more or less?,FD: That was ’48.,TN: ’48, right. One big thing I’m curious about Oppenheimer, and I’m not sure if anyone has covered this in ,, perhaps, but can you describe, maybe, how research or how your life was structured by Oppenheimer when you arrived at the Institute? Like, how would you say Oppenheimer organized the people working under him at the Institute?,FD: Oh, he didn’t.,TN: He didn’t.,FD: No, in point of fact, he wasn’t even there. We arrived here in September and the building we were supposed to occupy wasn’t yet finished, so we got to sit in Oppenheimer’s study, in fact, which was very nice. It was a big room, it’s still there in Fuld Hall, where the director entertains his guests, and so there’s a big table and it’s a big room, and so there are ten of us sitting around the table, we’re all the young post-docs, and it was a very friendly atmosphere, and of course we all got to know each other, and we were very happy that Oppenheimer was away in Europe and we could get along with our work.,TN:  It wasn’t until after the security hearings that he was sort of here consistently, right?,FD: Yes. Well, at that time he was traveling incessantly. I know he was in Europe for the first six weeks, and he appeared in November sometime, and then we went to our own offices in Building D and … He never really had much time for us. And he never told me what, on the contrary – I went occasionally to tell him what I had been doing, hoped to get his attention (laughs),TN: No luck?,FD: (laughs),TN: No luck on that front. So this is even after the security hearings?,FD: No, this was before. ‘Cause by the time he had the security hearings I was on the faculty. That was five years later. So I had my own group of post-docs and people I was responsible for. But he never actually worked in physics in all those years. That was, in a way, that was one of the tragic things about him. Of course, I talked with his wife, who is very understanding, I mean, his wife has been maligned by various books and television programs. She appeared in one horrible television series where she was supposed to be a sort of drunkard and bitch and just – just completely untrue. Anyway, she was actually a very solid and, I think much stronger character than he. And she talked to me once very frankly about Robert and his – that he desperately wanted to get back to doing some real physics himself. And would it be – he asked me if it would be possible to arrange a collaboration so I would really work with him and get him actually to sit down and do some calculations, which is something he actually never did.,TN: Why do you think – like, why was he not doing physics? Was this more his own choice after the Trinity explosion or was he, just ‘cause he was being more involved in political stuff with the Super? Or what?,FD: Well, I don’t know. I mean I have the same problem of course today – I’m eighty-two years old and – ‘course I can’t do physics the way I used to when I was young. I mean, it’s a gift, which really fades as you grow older. Some people, it fades more rapidly than others (laughs). And by the time you’re eighty-two it’s generally gone. But – but with Oppenheimer it seems to have gone earlier. Certainly part of it.

"Yes – I am one of those annoying North New Jerseyans who pretends they know the City. Just accept it. Like any other wannabe New Yorker, I jumped at the chance to show my suitemates around the Big Apple. Our lofty intentions of spending the afternoon shopping downtown were forced to contend with the desire to visit several major tourist attractions. Yikes. Luckily, this proved too ambitious as we found ourselves lured into the trap of FAO Schwarz.,No matter how many times I remind myself that FAO Schwarz is a just an overpriced toy store, when the doorman in his nutcracker suit welcomes me in, my defenses float away, and I forget that the place has been designed to cause small children to throw temper tantrums and force their weary parents to buy them whatever their little hearts desire. I forget that I am well past the age when I should fall head over heels for a doll, a toy, or even a stuffed animal. Indeed, I invariably begin acting like a five-year-old once again as soon as I enter the FAO Schwarz “plushies” room.,This heavenly expanse is filled with any type of stuffed animal you could dream up: Everything from a tiny $25 pig to a $10,000 wooly mammoth whose tusks and sheer size would send any sensible toddler running in terror. My roommates were instantly drawn to a velvety tiger that would easily take up our entire futon, and without any parental units there to hold us back, we put him behind the counter to pick up on our way out.,Next stop was the candy shop. We stayed long enough to make friends with the cashier, who let all eight of us pick one sweet treat each as a free sample. Unfortunately, the softball-sized jawbreakers were not an option. That said, we did manage to get satisfying sugar highs on gummy jaws, chocolate-covered Oreos, rock candy, and other nutritionally damaging foods.,In this state of heightened energy, we ventured upstairs to visit the famous giant piano from the movie Big. We patiently waited in line behind customers who were half my height to jump on the 22-foot long instrument. We split the group in half and made giant piano-playing a competitive sport. Each team tried their hardest to slide the farthest across the keyboard, jump the highest, and play the best songs. Those with distinct advantages were the ones with such extensive musical training that they could play “Greensleeves” with their feet, as well as those with DDR experience extreme enough that they could deliver chromatic scales with impeccable speed. We soon had an audience, though this probably had less to do with our skill level, and more to do with the rare sight of eight college kids chaotically bouncing up and down on a keyboard. Come to think of it, the piano would have been a wonderful addition to the common room – for a mere $150,000.,We then wandered into the doll section. We refrained from designing dolls at the doll factory with the doll section workers, who were dressed as delivery room nurses. The doll section, as one might expect, was slightly creepy overall, complete with haute couture figures, screaming face baby dolls, and dominatrix Barbies staring us down as we walked through the aisle. No wonder so many little girls grow up to have skewed body images.,Our transition into the cars was marked by remote controlled hot wheels careening around our feet. A red miniature Ferrari was on display that cost $50,000 – more than a real 300 series BMW. We agreed that University money would be well spent in switching the strange golf-cart like vehicles public safety drives around campus for a fleet of miniature Ferraris.,The next section caught me somewhere between awe and repulsion, as I asked myself, for the first and hopefully last time, who would seriously take the time to make a life-size Darth Vader out of Legos.,At this point, we realized that we had managed to spend over an hour in what is, after all, a toy store. We tried to escape, found ourselves making detours into divisions of Lincoln Logs and trains, board games and action figures. Finally, we made it back to the plushies counter. We paid for our soon-to-be beloved tiger, had him awkwardly stuffed into a bag, and cheerfully went on our way. After all, who needs to see the Empire State Building when you can visit the happiest place on Earth?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_faontain_of_youth/,"

"Although I will perhaps be labeled as crude and sensational, I should like to turn the light of psychoanalysis on Mr. M. Margolin, the president of the Undergraduate Student Government. Even the most skeptical observer cannot fail to discern that Mr. Margolin suffers from an obsessional neurosis; as Dr. Freud has remarked, these neuroses are in no way as flashy, dramatic or entertaining as hysteria or mania, but they represent an equally injurious deficiency of mnemic processes.,I shall begin, as any psychoanalyst should, with the symptoms – as is usually the case with obsessional neurosis, they appear to be the results of wild phantasy, but the dutiful reporters of the Daily Princetonian (amateur psychoanalysts themselves, to be sure!) have made an eminently trustworthy record of Mr. Margolin’s condition, one in which I repose every confidence, and on which I shall rely for my analysis, since I have never met Mr. Margolin, nor do I have any reason for so doing.,Mr. Margolin, in the course of his campaign for USG president, promised repeatedly to reduce the price of the essay packets sold at Pequod. His morbid insistence on this impossible task in fact became a kind of watchword, attracting negative comment from the editors of the Daily Princetonian, and, one can imagine, from Mr. Margolin’s own contemporaries. He emphasized several other issues in his campaign: 24-hour study space, reform of faculty advising, and minority relations.,It should already be clear to the reader how profoundly Mr. Margolin’s neurosis has affected him. The Pequod packets, traditional symbols of the female sex organs, are filled with essays that Mr. Margolin feels compelled to read; his insistence on driving down their price makes evident an eroto-megolomaniac complex, since he imputes desire for a lower price (greater sexual access) to the entire student body – both male and female. This gender confusion doubtless refers back to a childhood trauma, perhaps incipient transvesticism, and a version of the Oedipal complex that has shifted so far towards the morbid that it becomes more of a gender-inverse version of the Electra complex.,The contents of the packets, essays, an atomized body of knowledge, divided into discrete sections, represent both Mr. Margolin’s own castration anxiety and a frustrated dependence complex; the packets, with their labial pages and nurturing knowledge, clearly also represent Mr. Margolin’s mother, but here the Oedipal castration anxiety has turned in an unusual direction since Mr. Margolin is worried that the mother will be castrated (i.e. broken up, like the essays).,In this genderless state Mr. Margolin’s mother-figure would be unable to provide maternal care, which is clearly why he has emphasized increased closeness between academic advisors and students. Obviously Mr. Margolin is concealing a desire that the academic advisor will be able to take the place of his father and knit together the disparate essays contained in the packet, thus symbolically restoring his mother’s virginity (whose loss he blames on his own birth) – it is also immediately evident that this obsession traces back to a morbid fear of his parent’s connubial relations, since he wishes for the father (symbolized by the academic advisor) to be the one who restores his mother’s virginity. This may also be a gesture towards suicide, given Mr. Margolin’s morbid self-accusation.,At this point it cannot surprise the reader that the 24 hour study space on which Mr. Margolin insists is the womb; and that his insistence on study (i.e. the reading of packets) in such a space represents a neurotic demand for multiple vaginas – exaggerated female characteristics, couched within one another, that provide a smothering motherly presence.,It must also be obvious that Mr. Margolin’s plank of improving race-relations is really nothing more than a neurotic translation of his gender confusion – in a celebrated photograph published in the Daily Princetonian, Mr. Margolin can be seen to wear a pinstriped suit jacket, a striped shirt, and Nike slides (the slides, obvious symbols of the vagina, do not concern us). Clearly, the interior, softer striped shirt represents Mr. Margolin’s neurotic attachment to his mother, while the outer, harder wool jacket expresses his desire to be loved by his father – their dissimilar colors and similar stripes clearly form an analogy to his take on race relations. All students (metonymically, Tigers) of all races (the colors of his jacket and shirt) must improve their relations – Mr. Margolin’s neuroses have phantastically transposed his conceptions of masculinity and femininity onto the race issues of the student body, for his desire to unite the races is really, once again, terror of his parents’ sexual union.,Space here limits a full discussion of Mr. Margolin’s condition, but I trust that the reader will be able to pursue the line of interpretation on his or her own.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/erotomania_and_castration_anxiety_in_usg_pre/,"

"If a really good play goes up in a forest, does anyone care? I stumbled into Matthews Acting Studio last Thursday in my usual state— disheveled, confused, busily muttering banalities to imaginary socialites while bundled in my button-less vintage coat. I shuffled into the theater not knowing what to expect, where I was, or what day or month it may or may not have been. I had no clear idea what the play was about. Something about assassins and nighttime and Che Guevara or something. I tried to take my cue from my fellow audience members—who numbered, maybe, six other people. A hearty half of those people consisted of Theatre Program staff: the managing director, the costume designer and the set designer respectively. Additionally, and without any satisfactory explanation, there was a garrulous Artifact of Vintage Princetonia—a red-faced, hoary old fellow who remarked before the show that he had been one of the few people in the world to have been an active member of the Quadrangle Club for six consecutive years due entirely to a technicality of the Great War.  Other than a great passion for this play, which he suggested quite loudly to the rest of the audience was prime material for a musical adaptation, and an unparalleled streak at Quad, the reason was not clear why the man was at 185 Nassau Street that night. But we asked no questions for, discounting the stage crew, it was as sparse as it can get: Theatre people, myself and Captain Quad. ,What a privileged few we were! I’ve had many dramatic experiences here at Princeton—as an actor, as an audience member, as a naturist caked in a mix of guano and chalk dust—and few have equaled the professionalism, the careful attention to craft, and the theatrical power of Rosemary Rodriguez’s production of Jose Triana’s Night of the Assassins. Even before the three actors took their place, the set commanded and kept my attention. Exotic, suffocating, mysterious and meticulously professional, the stage environment set the play’s agenda. ,Well, what’s the play about? After a couple days of thinking, I’ve decided it’s Virginia C. Andrews’ “Flowers in the Attic” reinterpreted as a Santerian dream poem. If none of that makes sense, you’re not alone; I had to ask several people during the intermission what exactly was going on. That’s not so much a criticism of the play; though the program could have been scrubbed clean of a great deal of pretentious pseudo-academic babble and replaced by an edifying summary.  Something akin to: “This play is about three children—a brother and two sisters— who are kept in their cruel parent’s basement. They live in Cuba. They play with knives. Enjoy the show.”  Now that would have been helpful. ,Nevertheless, nothing can prepare you for, much less explain, the powerful performances of Irene Lucio, Aliza Kennerly and Paulo Quiros. After nearly three hours of these people screaming, adopting accents, miming, crying, becoming possessed, getting exorcised—generally hopping about all nimbly-pimbly—even an audience of six quickly appreciates their manifest talent as actors. Kennerly is equally persuasive as the lone beacon of sanity on stage and as the master psychotic manipulator. Quiros, too, is equally effective, though sometimes too effective, in his rants/convulsions/conversions. Irene Lucio, however, was a standout among the stellar—her nuanced adoption of several accents and characters was nothing short of astonishing, and interest in her performance was never exhausted during this exhausting play. She could also win any number of Mambo drumming contests if she so desired. ,See this play, children. Wonder what the heck this has to do with the Cuban Revolution. Wonder why old men can come into our halls so freely. Wonder how so talented a group of people can accomplish something so marvelous…and go unnoticed. ,Student Tickets: 8 Dollars.

"It had to happen sometime. That “1918” chant wasn’t going to hold up forever. Sooner or later, the Babe was going to get tired of haunting his old team, and, because the entire 86-year story has already been fodder for plenty of books and is destined for Hollywood immortalization, it makes sense that George H. Ruth would move on to bigger and better things right in the middle of a goddamn series. But, I refuse to devolve into Espn.com-like bitterness. As a matter of fact, I’m writing this article to congratulate the fans of our rivals to the northeast. With all the ways a championship season can be derailed, winning the World Series is harder these days than it has ever been. Three rounds, thirty teams, and that long schedule… it’s a rough season any way you slice it. And to ascend to the top of the baseball totem pole for the first time since World War One was being fought must feel great. Immense accomplishment. But, once you’re on top, where do you go, Red Sox Nation? ,The reason New Englanders (and those who jump on the immense bandwagon every year) are so tightly bonded is because oppressed ideological minorities tend to grow closer as they are mistreated for longer and longer periods of time. They bond over pitchers of Sam Adams in sad little pubs and every year cling to some thin strand of hope that this, finally, will be “the year.” Most of the Nation’s parents weren’t even born the last time the Sox reached the mountaintop. So, now, a truly lifelong goal has been achieved for millions of people. The Yankees, though we remain evil, can’t really be the “Evil Empire” anymore, because the entire idea behind being an empire is an aura and a mystique of invincibility. Once vanquished, and in the emphatic and embarrassing way that we were, there is no way that the Red Sox fans will ever have that vague fear in the back of their minds when they play us, that voice that tells them, or used to, that they just are not going to win, and that, close as they may get, they will somehow have their hopes and dreams crushed by the end of the season. For the Red Sox, the limit used to be the sky, but now the sky’s the limit.,So, whatever will you do with your newfound power, your confidence in your team? It’s clear that you were never people to give up hope, since your constant pain and anguish made each and every one of you die-hard fans, but really now, you can’t whine anymore. You can’t yell at us and say we buy championships, because the World Series winner with the highest payroll of them all is… the 2004 Red Sox. You can’t go to ESPN.com and hope to find Bill Simmons, Jim Caple, and the rest of the staff writing articles to help you commiserate. Because, I’ll tell ya this, Sox fans, when we beat the Mets around the head and shoulders in 2000, it was pretty sweet, because at that point, the Mets were everyone’s bandwagon team. And the sweetness lasted a little while. But by the spring, it was nothing more than an afterthought. Whenever you guys lost (and I’m sure you all can remember many a time when that took place), it was the type of thing that hangs over you throughout the winter months, making you recoil slightly each and every time you saw a baseball. When the Sox were about to finish off the Cardinals like a one-sided Mortal Kombat battle, my OA leader was in such absolute shock that I don’t think she believed she was awake. After so many cold, harsh winters, this season might just feel a little warmer, the wind a little softer, as you revel in the fact that you’ve won more recently than we have. But, like I said, the sweet taste of success lingers for much less time than the bitterness of failure, and if you thought the Yankees were evil now, just watch how many over-the-hill free agents we overpay this year.,In the past, our excessive spending made you angry, as if you were not a very rich team with the league’s second-highest payroll. But now, our lack of financial frugality will cause laughter among you. All those formerly hostile internet boards will be full of laughter when we try to coax Mattingly out of retirement or build ourselves a robotic Giambi, or something to that effect. Because, since baseball in this part of the country really only has two teams in it, we can never be even. One team, every year, goes farther than the other. And now that it’s you, for the first time in over a decade, we become the oppressed fans. Not oppressed by a long period of time, but by the way in which our constant superiority was suddenly taken from us. Perhaps we deserve it, because I can’t say I haven’t taunted a few people over the years, but that’s just sports fandom. We consider the team’s accomplishments our own, and thus their success gives us the right to say whatever we want, as if we were on the field. Silly, of course, but that’s the nature of being a fan. So now the “cocky, arrogant, asshole” Yankee fans, myself included, will have to humble ourselves for at least one winter, enduring similarly dumb chants of “Year-Two-Thou-sand” when the season starts and hoping that some way, some how, we can beat those guys who took our glory from us. But it’s not going to take more than half a century, that’s for sure. I mean, this weird, 86-year curse thing is of course a product of bad decisions (you really can’t get rid of Babe Ruth, and Buckner had bad knees) and bad luck (Bucky and Boone), but unless you’re from Chicago, it’s the not the type of thing that’s going to happen again to any baseball team you root for. Every dog has its day, and every shitty team has a few good years here and there. And, besides, like the Red Sox, the Yankees, even when they don’t win, are usually quite competitive. We may have to dismantle before we return to glory, as we did about ten years ago, and we may have to kill Steinbrenner so we can make good decisions rather than purely greedy ones, but we haven’t sold any future immortals to finance Broadway shows, and there’s only been one decade since the 20s when we haven’t won the series (the 80s). We’ll be back next year, with a one-year vengeance as strong as any cursed team would ever have. But enough about the team. As much as we like to pretend we can, we fans can’t change what happens on the field. All we can do is argue with each other, and argue we shall.,We’ll argue about whose off-season acquisitions are the best. We’ll argue about which stadium is cooler. We’ll argue about which city is more fun, though that really is no contest. We’ll argue until the first pitch is thrown in March, and then we’ll argue some more. Because that’s all fans do, at the end of the day. We live and die with our favorite 25 men in uniform, and use what happens on the field as fuel to brag or brood. And then we do it again the next year, because we don’t know any other way.,It’s a very new feeling, being just-another-team for a few months. Even when we haven’t won the Series, we’re usually better than them. But this year, we can’t make that claim. And, you know, the series still smarts a little, but, as I say to Californians to explain why I don’t mind harsh winters, now that we’re out in the cold, it’ll be much more fun to get back into the warmth. And until that day, I’ll just keep arguing, even from the losing side, because, at the end of the day, we still have 86 years of being the world’s most successful sports franchise to think about, and hours upon hours of “Yankees Classics” to watch on YES, and though they may have finally gotten to us, and though they may or may not relive this month for the rest of their lives, this is just one really bad year to us, and there’s another season coming around the corner. Besides, what’s done is done, and 26 is still a hell of a lot more than 6.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/so_its_finally_the_year/,"

": I live my life in a state of bemused annoyance. Sometimes, mostly on the weekends, the irritation subsides, and I experience fleeting moments of unadulterated joy. At other times, the humor that keeps me afloat is overrun by pet peeves, and my measured displeasure becomes a pointed resentment. What has boiled my blood for the past several weeks has been this nauseating wave of football-fueled, rah-rah school spirit. My esteemed colleague, on the other hand, seems to have been energized by this shift in energy. I understand that I am perhaps arguing from the position of a small minority, but this issue has become very dear to my heart, and I feel the need to attack it.,: Bring it on.,: Let us begin with the matter of fandom. As a supporter of a couple professional teams, I am quite emotionally connected to their ups and downs because my love for the organizations has grown over the years. Before I came here, I considered generally supporting the Princeton teams (and I am slightly happier when they win than when they lose), and I was, many moons ago, a member of the Jadwin Jungle, the largest fan club on campus. And yet the idea that we should all become passionate about a group of players just because they wear the orange and black has always been fairly silly to me. This rise in enthusiasm that has coincided with the team’s success is the epitome of front running, similar to loving the Bulls for a few years when Jordan was on top of his game.,: Ironic, since I’ve never been a follower of any sport and only a supporter of certain teams on very rare special occasions. My colleague is right to denounce fair-weather fans, and not being even a fan of football in general, let alone traditionally a fan of the Princeton Tigers in particular, I freely admit to being one myself. At least up until now. But his objection to students’ supporting a team simply because it plays on behalf of their school is uncompelling. It’s common practice for people to support an athletic team that represents their home piece, be it their school, their city, their state or their country. I’m no hockey fan, but if the Montreal Canadiens ever regain the old magic with which they once dominated the ice, be sure I’ll be out there cheering – the same way I cheered Trinidad and Tobago’s Soca Warriors in last summer’s soccer World Cup.,Justin’s opposition to this strikes me as rather petulant. Why not celebrate and take pride in the accomplishments of people who come from where you come from? I could understand a greater deal of skepticism in the case of pro sports teams, many of whose players don’t actually come from the cities or states on whose behalf they play. Every Princeton Tiger, however, goes to Princeton, and if they can accomplish what they did against those Yale punks earlier this month, I am proud of them, because they are my classmates. They come from one of the groups I identify with as part of my background, and – like at least 99% of the human race – I take pride in the achievements of people with whom I have much in common. That’s why I cheer for my Tigers, and I make no apologies for it.,: I see and freely acknowledge Akil’s point that most of, say, the Yankees are not from Manhattan, as I am, and that I most certainly have less in common with their players than I do with the Tigers that play for us. As a matter of fact, I do hope that my particular friends on the team do well. But it’s not just Princeton football that goes uncheered in the Gerald household, there are other things as well. I pay zero attention to the fate of the United States in international competitions, be they soccer, basketball, or winter sports, and, no matter how well they do, I never support the Giants or the Jets over another team simply because of the city that raised me. Maybe my particular distaste for this recent enthusiasm is due to the mix of boredom and hatred that I have for the sport of football, or maybe it’s because I’m reluctant to support a school, and a population, that I, for the most part, hate so very deeply. I’m having trouble separating the two, but I know that they both factor into the equation.,: Well, it seems I forgot to read the memo. I thought we were here to dispute the validity of cheering the Princeton Tigers’ recent football success, fundamentally. But Justin’s last point simply states that ,, as an individual, never supports the teams representing his country or his home city for its own sake, and thus feels no need to support his school’s team in the same vein. My man should give the rest of us a reason to share his approach to the matter. It seems most of us Princetonians are, to varying extents, into school spirit when it comes to sports, while my esteemed colleague has no use for it. Perhaps he could explain just , makes his distaste for athletic school spirit legitimate and our taste for it not so?,: All right. I’ll focus. You know why I think it’s not legitimate? Because, aside from the certain amount of people who genuinely enjoy the sport of football and have always been excited by the team’s ups and downs, the majority of the people who have recently expressed undying excitement are not authentic in their desires. The reason I mentioned my long-nurtured fandom of a couple professional sports franchises is because I will, barring some unforeseen catastrophe, continue to cheer for them until my mind stops working, whether I have the opportunity to attend the games or not. Since the days in the fall of 2003 when I was first convinced to walk across the campus on several Saturdays, it has seemed to me that people really only congregate around these football games as an excuse to engage in extremely silly behavior, whether it’s chanting simple mantras until the noise fades or tailgating in sundresses. Maybe, after a long miserable week spent in class, we long to detach our brains and emulate the actions of the (literally) colorful youths painted their team colors and screaming at the ESPN cameras. In my head, the way I look at the world, it takes decades of love, success and heartache to foster emotion deep enough to cause me to act the way so many do when cheering for our football team.,: “The majority of the people who have recently expressed undying excitement are not authentic in their desires.” Hmmm. To which “desires” is Justin referring exactly? The desire to merely cheer on a particular legion of helmeted jocks? If so, , if this desire is the only thing that drives Princeton’s boorish football fans, then he’s right; given Princetonians’ lackadaisical support of our football team up to this point, it seems most of us are late arrivals at this party. But I don’t think this is the desire our fans are , expressing. I think their cheering for Princeton represents something bigger: the desire to support their school whenever it distinguishes itself in , field of endeavor. The bottom line is that we love our school and are proud and glad to see it do well. I think the fact that the fans haven’t been consistent in their backing of the Tigers over time is in itself proof of this. Such fair-weather fandom , make for poor athleticism—but I think it makes for acceptable school spirit. Who knows, this could actually prove the catalyst for more dedicated support of the Tigers in years to come. ,Lastly, Justin admitted earlier that he for the most part deeply hates the school he goes to and the student body he shares it with, and that this may be the root cause of his disdain for cheering the Tigers. This is unfortunate, for it is completely irrelevant to people like me, who, for all the shit we’ve been through in the Orange Bubble, still deeply love this school and what it stands for—and yes, even the douchebags we go to school with. ,: I’ll amend my earlier statement and say that, much as I may detest the vast majority of the people and the activities on this campus, I do value my three-plus years here more than any other period of my life, since they have helped turn me into the bemused, annoyed (yet altogether happier) person I am today. Perhaps my many scars have turned me into a spiritless Scrooge. For everyone who has genuinely enjoyed the success of our team over the past few months, I’m glad for you, and I hope you continue to do so for your own sake. But if tailgating in sundresses or bright pink shorts is your greatest pleasure on a Saturday afternoon or evening, do us all a favor, and go to hell.,I thank Akil for this spirited discussion, and I look forward to another one at some point soon.,: Perhaps sooner than you think…I have a bone to pick with certain trendy interpretations of a certain boorish Kazakh we all know and love…",http://www.nassauweekly.com/school_spirit/,"

"Acting is the art of seeming, not being,” Carl Stone Jr. intones self-importantly to the wide-eyed ingénue Elfie Fay, the on (and off) stage Ophelia to his Hamlet. In cynically giving her the cold hard facts about the “world’s second oldest profession,” i.e. acting, he tells her that if he were to play the part of an actor who was playing the role of Hamlet, “that would still be acting.” The irony is, of course, that we the audience are watching an actor, in this instance Kent Kuran ’08, doing just that: playing the part of an actor who is playing the role of Hamlet. Despite his acting philosophy, he can’t help but “be” Hamlet. And so go the metaphysical situations of Charles Ludlam’s 1975 play of the Ridiculous Theater movement, ,, about an acting troupe whose lives begin to look an awful lot like those of the characters they play. ,Like standing between two mirrors and staring at the infinite progression of identical images trapped in the glass, Ludlam wants us to explore how life imitates art imitates life. While many of his plays invert gender roles or end up in chaotic orgies, this one takes a subtler route. In ,, the role of the viewer is inverted. As director Whitney Mosery ’08 told me, “The audience is backstage, for better or for worse.”,In fact, I got a literal taste of the backstage feel in going to see a run-through of the show on Monday evening. The young cast took little notice of my black notebook and me and went about their merry, goofing-off way. One of them, Carolyn Edelstein ’10, flitted about with a digital camera, capturing a fellow actor’s fake beard-as-wig costume improvisation as well as an absurd arrangement of props. Without hesitation, I picked her out as the ingénue/Ophelia actress due to her wide-eyed enthusiasm and vivacious grin. Clearly, life was imitating art was imitating life…Even Mosery’s role as director represented the type of inversion and topsy-turvy reversal loved so well by the Ridiculous Theater crowd. Though supposedly a care-free student like her cast, she often had to play the role of Mother Hen to her exuberant brood of actors, coaxing them to take their places and wearily telling them, “Yes, you may go to the bathroom now.”,The conflation of the onstage show and the backstage life, both in the play and in the real-life rehearsal I watched, gets at the heart of the play and the movement Ludlam’s works embody. By skirting around the classical “fourth wall” of the stage to see what exactly lies beyond it, the play exposes to us, the viewers, just how inextricable our lives are from the stories we know. We are what we read, it seems. ,But life and art do not merely melt together into one grand metaphysical stew. Elements of one or the other always turn up to plague the characters. Shakespeare’s , is, according to , characters, a murder mystery tinged by “the streak of the irrational.” Hamlet is haunted by the ghost of his (supposedly) murdered father. Yet, he is also haunted by his confusion over his mother’s behavior, the collapse of his relationship with Ophelia, his uncertainty over which course of action to take, his potential madness, even by the memory of long-dead court jester, Yorick. Many of the best adaptations and spin-offs of , embrace this overabundance of ghosts: in Paul Rudnick’s ,, the main character is haunted by the ghost of Hamlet past, John Barrymore, while in Tom Stoppard’s ,, two seemingly minor characters stumble in and out of their scenes with the “main” characters as they float behind the scenes of the original play, haunting the empty rooms of Elsinore. Ludlam’s work tips its hat to the idea of haunting by having too many actual ghosts to make a final, rational explanation for everything plausible.,Beyond literally using the irrational in the form of ghosts, the play shows how literature haunts us and our language. I myself have read , a half dozen times, seen it performed at least that many, and have even, in high school, performed in it myself as a female Horatio (a twist Ludlam would have surely loved). Each time, Act V causes me to catch my breath as if it were the first read-through. I am haunted by ,’s questions and phrases, and I see its echoes in almost everything else I read. In ,, characters at first recite lines to each other backstage jokingly and then as serious expressions of their emotions, with no line demarcating play-acting from real life. The best works of the Western canon – or any great piece of literature – do more than reflect passive mirror images of life; rather, they infuse and enrich our lives with their narratives.,Thus, , reminds us of why classics are classic while also creating a perspective all its own. In fact, this could be the very mission statement of the revitalized Princeton Shakespeare Company, as headed by Georgie Sherrington ’08. In an attempt to overhaul their image of being too esoteric for their own Bard-loving good, the Company has recently been putting on comedies and 20th century reckonings of Shakespeare before turning back to “serious plays” like Richard II this spring. Nonetheless, Ludlam’s play, for all its farcical twists and physical gags, does take a serious look at the implications of Hamlet and asks us to reexamine why it is so enduring. ,I know this has not been a typical review, detailing which actors did well or which set elements were most effective, but, frankly, the version I saw on Monday night, rife with technical issues, was too rough for a fair critique. Yet, for those of us who wrestle with literature’s place in today’s world and/or just like a good joke about men in tights, then seeing , this weekend is a must.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/life_imitates_artimitates_life/,"

"I started home for Thanksgiving Tuesday afternoon, willingly cutting shorter my half-week of classes to add a full day to my debutante preparations. It hadn’t taken me long to pack and add a few necessary additions to cover every possible situation and temperature that four and a half days in Jackson, Mississippi on a debutante and holiday week could throw at me. I have to be honest, even with all my initial disdain and later reluctance, butterflies had already taken permanent residence in my stomach on the plane ride home, fluttering wildly with each thought about what Friday would bring. ,Wednesday and its appointments and preparations went by without a hitch. I even had time to demonstrate my housewifely eligibility by baking an exquisite chocolate pecan pie. Thanksgiving was, well, Thanksgiving, with perhaps slightly less gorging on my part – which doesn’t say much at all. I still ate far more than could be reasonably excused for an NFL linebacker at a typical meal.,Friday morning, and the day had arrived. For the third straight morning, I awoke not to sunlight gently streaming in through the windows across the room from my bed but instead The Dress, suspended like a ghostly apparition, foretelling the night to come, eerily retaining its shape even while hanging from my curtain rods. The Dress refused to let me forget the event to come. Fortunately, the day’s schedule promised to provide some sort of oblivion.,It began with a mid-morning presenter-daughter rehearsal for that night. The second I walked in the door of the Jackson Country Club, after screeching my car into an invented parking spot and throwing on jewelry, a girl I hadn’t seen since middle school wrapped me in a huge hug. Without time to either respond or feel incredibly awkward, we were called into the ballroom, where both the presentation and dance would take place. It was then that it truly hit me: ever since agreeing to take part in this deb (like I’d actually ever had a choice), I had told myself and others that I was at least excited about getting to see the other girls – best friend or mere acquaintance, I have an amazing ability to lose touch with almost everyone I know. ,As one hug reminded me, this really would be the perfect way to reconnect with these girls, especially because we “upheld the integrity and honor of the Mississippi Debutante Society, which must be kept in tact so that our daughters too shall have the opportunity to come into society by way of such an esteemed organization…” as we were reminded moments later, standing with our presenters (for the most part, our fathers). Evidently, with a great white dress comes great responsibility. The rehearsal passed uneventfully, conversations ranging from hellos to thoughts on smuggling in pre-presentation alcohol (clearly a move NOT in keeping with the rich and elegant tradition of the Jackson Debutante, but oh-so necessary). I couldn’t help but notice something a bit strange in the midst of the tasteful décor: a small gathering of fairy statues off to one side of the runway and a single fairy just above the archway looking down at our attempt to live up to tradition and expectations. As we awkwardly made our way down that Astroturf runway for the first time, wearing the shoes we’d be in that night, that little incongruous, impish statue made everything much easier. ,The remainder of the day passed quickly, filled with girlish activities that I typically avoid out of suspicion. This time, however, something out of the ordinary was entirely necessary, so I agreed to having my hair and makeup done. Finally, the time came to put on The Dress. However, like most things in my life, this couldn’t simply go off without a hitch. Because of a makeup delay (read: the woman putting on my face kept disappearing for ten-minute intervals), I had ten minutes to pull off a twenty minute maneuver and get to the country club in time for the first of hundreds of pictures. This picture was one of many randomly assigned groups of fathers (presenters) and daughters, and, as my mother hysterically reminded me as I ran into the house, I was in the first group. ,I flew up to my room and readied myself for The Dress. With its many hooks, straps, and zippers, The Dress could not be put on by its wearer. In fact, getting me in the dress was a process so complex that my mother had written out six-step instructions. Unfortunately, a panic had descended upon the Fenelon house: my mom’s zipper refused to complete its final four inches of closure. Now I know what you’re thinking, but before you start making “Yo Mamma’s so fat” jokes, hear this: my mom is TINY. Seriously. The two sides of the zipper met, but simply refused to zip together. So there I stood, half-naked, awaiting The Dress, as my father sewed my mom into her dress. I’m still not sure how she got it off, but that disaster took away any possibility of making the first picture on time. Fifteen minutes later, all dresses on (and tails on my father—don’t get any ideas!), the three of us jumped in my dad’s truck with my body wrapped in a sheet, leaning somewhat sideways to protect The Dress. I walked in pulling on my long white gloves to see a picturesque display of debs seated before their fathers with one quite conspicuous empty space in the middle and anxious faces all turned my way. Oops. ,Post-picture, things became a blur of reapplying lipstick, meaningless nervous chatter, and the loss of two of the pearl beaded buttons on my great-grandmother’s antique gloves. We had little else to do: the women of the Debutante Committee, rulers of the night, had cloistered us in a side hallway, sight-unseen until our exhibition, alone, in the spotlight on the Astroturf. Whenever any girl in white got too close to the end of the hallway near the guests, she was unceremoniously herded back into place. Finally, we were given the signal and scurried into alphabetical order. The sedate piano music began, the Master of Ceremonies thanked all the appropriate folks, and the first name was called. Major butterflies. ,I found myself fourth in the lineup – a seriously good thing. Any more time behind the curtains would have sent my nerves over the edge. As it was, I held my flowers in just the right place, didn’t bob as I walked, stood up straight, smiled, and – this is a big deal – didn’t trip! The actual walk flew by, and for most of it, I had my dad’s support. I couldn’t believe it was such a non-event. Neither could my body, which for the ten minutes following my descent from the runway (again, no trip!) refused to stop quivering. Once I’d regained my composure, I settled in to watch the next twenty-six girls. They too got through mostly without a hitch and only one “Dad, you’re on my dress!!” hiss.,A rather tense moment did come when, right before the next deb appeared, a girl in the audience fainted (I mean, really. She’s only watching and she can’t keep it together. Clearly not future deb material!), but the deb paid it no attention, beaming so brightly she pulled all the attention right back to the runway. Following the presentation, my life became one big camera flash; the professional photographer and my grandmother alternated, never giving anyone a second to relax. At least my grandmother didn’t throw out lines like “Say popcorn! Say…money! Say….peanuts!” before every shot. The photographer just never got the hint, even when my ever-enthusiastic mother was the only one responding. The pictures without her in them got somewhat awkward, as we stood silently refusing to give in to her absurd photographic requests.,In one of the last pictures, my mother, grandmother, and I posed together: three generations of Jackson, Mississippi Debutantes. The commotion around us seemed to pause – or at least allowed us to do so in its midst – as I realized just how much tradition, love, community, and heartfelt pride rode on this night, this seemingly silly and antiquated event that in actuality meant a great deal. Besides, as soon as the pictures were completed and I’d trod all over my patient father and reluctant brother’s feet in the first two traditional dances, that night was a party. Jackson outdoes itself for this event, and my shoes, several hours and many dances later, completely outdid my feet. They’ll recover eventually, but I’ll never forget that night, and can’t wait for the party season to come over the holidays.,Oh, and The Dress? Let’s just say it was a huge hit. The kind of dress that people turn and stare at and that gets one unofficially named “best dressed” by the other debs. So worth it.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/debball_delights/,"

"It’s fitting that the two floors housing the exhibitions “Picasso and American Art” (reviewed in the issue of October 12) and “Edward Hopper: Highlights from the Collection” are adjacent. These shows typify two different trends of 20th century American art in response to the welter of European modernism: on the one hand, some artists sought to emulate, incorporate, or improve upon the profusion of European formalist experimentation exploding across the Atlantic; on the other hand, some artists, harking back to earlier American masters like Eakins, Homer, and Sargent, sought to deploy a basically realist manner in service of a variety of cultural, ideological, and aesthetic ends (Ashcan school, American scene painting, etc). If “Picasso and American Art” is a masterful compendium of the former, “Edward Hopper” is a preeminent exemplar of the latter. For this exhibition, heavyweight loans from MOMA, the Art Institute of Chicago, and a smattering of other museums supplement the Whitney’s already massive collection of Hoppers. The result is a show which includes virtually every significant work of the artist. No one should miss it.,Like his compatriots working in American scene painting, Hopper drew his subjects from the pedestrian topography of American life: hotel rooms, diners, gas-stations, streets of small-town shops, and the occasional spectral white house or big red barn. But unlike American scene paintings, Hopper’s works don’t exude the typical prefab nostalgia for old-timey America, nor are they awash in the picturesque glow that lights up all those white-bread towns full of cherubic youngsters and hale grandfathers. Yet neither are Hopper’s works consecrated to the plight of the worker, the factitious conditions of his immiseration, and his revolutionary vocation, as one would expect in Social Realism, which was the leftist version of American scene painting. Rather, his works feature simple arrangements from both urban and rural settings in a bright, clean style of naturalism that is nonetheless expressive of the emptiness and angst of modern life. Edward Hopper paints pictures where everything seems alright, but in your heart you know they’re not. Working with an impressive compositional acumen along with his own idiom of stark, gelid light, Hopper depicts the most mundane and ordinary things – a woman reading in a hotel room, someone looking out a window, people in a diner, people in a lobby, people in an office, the façade of a house, an empty street – in order to create poetic moments of hushed alienation, unremarked melancholy, and forlorn beauty. The glazed ordinariness of his paintings seems only to adumbrate some muffled tragedy or narcotized dolor. His figures all appear transfixed in tedium, waiting for something that will never come, whatever it was supposed to be.,The subject of , (1939) is not, in fact, a movie in New York – the distinction belongs instead to the exhausted-looking woman on the right of the painting, probably an usher or attendant. An ornate column anchors a heavy wall cleaving the pictorial space in half; on the left, the field of perspective coincides with the orientation of the theater seats, exerting a powerful force on the eye leftwards to a point just to the right of the big screen. The woman appears a refugee from the screen’s all-powerful allure. Chiaroscuro introduced by a bank of lights to her left further emphasizes the woman as the focus of the painting, and even the light seems to encumber her. What private grief, epiphany, or repose she enfolds in her closed posture, downturned face, and thoughtful silence, we’ll never know. Ultimately, the privacy of her passion and sideline status dwelling on the margins of spectacle comes to stand for the wayside feeling of the piece on the whole – its evocation of things elided and abraded by the impersonal gears of mass conformity, its Brueghel-like indifference to whatever just wasn’t important enough to make the final cut.,The loneliness of the individual in a crowd was a recurring theme for Hopper. , (1942), probably the most well-known of the artist’s works, features a man sitting removed from an apparently genial colloquy taking place down the counter. He sits with his back to the viewer, the jacket taut over tense dorsal musculature, some kind of stoicism for the working day. The entire left half of the painting is given over to an empty street watched by rows of dark windows. Harsh, incomprehensible lighting imbues the scene with a brutal radiance.   , (1930) looks like a still from an Antonioni movie that was left to soak in maroon paint. Long, horizontal streaks of sunlight creep down the street in this inexplicably desolate composition. The rising sun imparts more a sense of weary exposure or harried repetition than waking promise. , (1960), two women, one old and one young, sit in poses variously recumbent ,.  Whereas the old woman leans back in her chair with an air of what Faulkner described in Rosa Coldfield as “embattled virginity,” the younger perches atop the railing as if to solicit the fleeting attentions of some passing flaneur. You get the idea she’s perching in vain because no one’s coming, and even if someone did come, he wouldn’t be coming with what she was really looking for. The secret of the painting lies in its juxtaposition of these two figures – Youth and Age, two moments from the same lonely arc.  ,What light falling across water was for the Impressionists – delicate shimmering and variegated splendor, at once both formative problem and ultimate emblem– this is what sunlight shining into a room was for Hopper. Those blocky swathes of shadow and light are painted as if the threatened intrusion of an alien and arbitrary geometry into the life-world, more Caravaggist than Impressionist. , (1961) depicts a nude woman holding a cigarette in the morning sun, sad yet resolute. Her shadow stretches behind her as she is enveloped by the sunlight’s entrance. The bed is unmade. The painting works both as a kind of Annunciation and memento to the decay of the flesh, yet it does so with a pathos and everyday naturalism not to be found generally in either.,If you have even the faintest affinity for American art, you’re sure to cotton to Hopper and this exhibition – check it out before it checks out for good. Remember, the Whitney is free on Fridays from 6 to 9 and usually slap full of young people.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/clean_welllighted_places/,"

"Jürgen Habermas, born June 19, 1929, in a wood-frame house near the , of Düsseldorf, passed away last Tuesday at the age of 78. The cause of death is, as of this writing, unknown. He leaves behind a considerable body of work and is survived by his third wife, Lucinda, and children Thürgen, Thor, Törless, and Robert. His inestimable contributions to sociology, theory, and Theory cannot be estimated.,My father, a man of profound erudition, often settled me for bed with a glass of warm milk and a few paragraphs of the rather bitter (and brilliantine) newspaper exchanges between Habermas and a crusty Jacques Derrida. I would imagine the latter’s sonorous, looping French as I lay tucked beneath my flannel bedclothes. Habermas spoke a workmanlike Italian and a sturdy English, but I’ll be damned if he could write a single word of Flaubert’s tongue. My father and I would discuss this, in some form or another, before singing the first verse of ‘La Marseillaise’ (he took the melody, I the baritone harmony) and brushing our teeth.,Habermas wrote many books and delivered many important lectures on many variegated topics, including—but not limited to—climate change and ,, the status of the unborn foetus, the primacy of the Pope, university politics in Tübingen, and the emergence of a transcendent ‘public sphere’ for human communication. Known for his turgid, unreadable poetry, Habermas nevertheless insisted that his paramour Marlene Dietrich accompany him on his ‘recitation tours’ of the countryside, wherein he alternated between Dutch and German versions of his favorite ,. The famed actress was known to remark, after one such occasion, ‘Ach du meine Gute Jürgie, was denn für Liebe ist dies?’ or roughly, ‘What the balls?’ ,In his forties, Habermas was crippled by the severest of writer’s block, forcing him into Luddite seclusion near Heidegger’s , home. His frequent migraines presaged the severe pulmonary thrombosis which was to later end his life. He filled his days with the chopping of wood. It is in these years of relatively low productivity that Habermas produced his twelve most famous works, beginning with , (‘Toward a Cricket’s Concept of Metaspheres’) and ending with , (‘Comedy of Pigs’). ,Owing to his exceptional infertility (1), Habermas led a solitary existence. His Frau Lucinda died in a duel with Dietrich one winter’s night in the late 1970s, spurring Habermas’s most intense period of personal reflection. Within a month he had lost fifty pounds, taught himself to read ancient Sanskrit, and entered the West German Defense Force as an intelligence cadet. This epoch is represented stunningly in Count Heinrich von Kleistermacher’s 1986 monograph, loosely translated as ‘One Week in the Brush with a Thinker.’ (2),Habermas was known for his fits of preternaturally intense eating, which would sometimes last upwards of seven weeks. It was a gluttony without bound or sense. According to his (late) biographer Ulrich Steinhardt, Habermas could swallow twelve curry-sauced , in one sitting. He would repeat this exercise scores of times while watching , versions of American sitcoms. He took to washing down these many pounds of Teutonic trans-fat with a gallon or so of artificially-sweetened Riesling. Such habits undoubtedly led to his later heart condition and death, this June, of catastrophic liver failure. He was sixty years old.,As of this past Friday, I had never heard of Jürgen Habermas. My father—a foreman in the local steel-bending plant—could rarely take time enough to wash himself and me on alternate Sundays, let alone to purchase the hundreds of collections of beat lyric Habermas produced in his ludicrous, meaningless time on earth. I can read no French and no German. Neither, coincidentally, could Habermas, the child of Hungarian immigrants, who was born aboard a tram-steamer in the Indian Ocean and remained without citizenship until his twentieth birthday, when be joined the French Foreign Legion. It was his only period of military service, and a difficult one, leading to spells of ulcerous fever that would eventually claim his life, at the age of ninety, in a small bathhouse near Geneva.,When pressed, I can say two things about Habermas’s work. Firstly, it is utterly boring and dense. Here is a passage:,_Wie froh bin ich, daß ich weg bin! Bester Freund, was ist das Herz des Menschen! Dich zu verlassen, den ich so liebe, von dem ich unzertrennlich war, und froh zu sein! Ich weiß, du verzeihst mir’s. Waren nicht meine übrigen Verbindungen recht ausgesucht vom Schicksal, um ein Herz wie das meine zu ängstigen? Die arme Leonore! Und doch war ich unschuldig. Konnt’ ich dafür, daß, während die eigensinnigen Reize ihrer Schwester mir eine angenehme Unterhaltung verschafften, daß eine Leidenschaft in dem armen Herzen sich bildete? Und doch – bin ich ganz unschuldig? Hab’ ich nicht ihre Empfindungen genährt? Hab’ ich mich nicht an den ganz wahren Ausdrücken der Natur, die uns so oft zu lachen machten, so wenig lächerlich sie waren, selbst ergetzt? Hab’ ich nicht – o was ist der Mensch, daß er über sich klagen darf! Ich will, lieber Freund, ich verspreche dir’s, ich will mich bessern, will nicht mehr ein bißchen Übel, das uns das Schicksal vorlegt, wiederkäuen, wie ich’s immer getan habe; ich will das Gegenwärtige genießen, und das Vergangene soll mir vergangen sein._,And now a brief translation from the original French, as recorded by my father:,_An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them as the palm should flourish, As Peace should still her wheaten garland wear, And stand a comma ’tween their amities, And many such-like as-es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving time allow’d.   Hor. How was this seal’d? Ham. Why, even in that was Heaven ordinant I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscrib’d it, gave ’t the impression, plac’d it safely The changeling never known._,Secondly, Habermas viewed words as a brute instrument and nothing more. His primary mode of communication was non-narrative modern dance. Often, on long strolls along Chicago’s Magnificent Mile, Habermas would regale a bemused colleague (3) with balletic recountings of his third tour of service as a member of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Korea. Known for his peripatetic jocularity, Habermas loved to joke, ‘Mein zweiter Vorname ist Tanzer, also muss ich singen!’ (roughly: ‘My entire life as a thinker is rife with fraud’). Such self-doubt undoubtedly led to his early death, at the age of twenty-six, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.,I must here say—and excuse so personal an interjection—that Habermas was the sweetest, loveliest, dullest dullard I have ever had chance to meet. Often in late summer would we stroll along the headier climes of his beloved Salzburg, laughing silently to ourselves, slapping each other chummily on the back, thinking only of evening and our time together, alone, playing chess, singing, lying about, before a fireplace, beneath the full moon, speaking a broken Swiss-German and asking, finally—who out there will read us when we’re gone? Who out there remembers?,Thoughts of this nature, I’m afraid, led to his late-night ride on horseback through the Pennsylvanian woods, I believe last Sunday or so, when he ran full-force into an oak, sustained a fusion of the second and third cervical vertebrae, and, well, just plain crapped out.,Notes,(1) Habermas was one of the pioneers of sperm-preservation technology, although his contributions to this field of medical science, much like Moses’s contributions to the plight of the fleeing Israelites, led him right up to, but not inside, the Promised Land of Fatherhood.,(2) Kleistermacher’s scholarly intentions were never clear. Some believe his pederastic relationship with Habermas’s eldest son Ernst prompted this work’s tendency toward creepily-sexual overstatement.,(3) Otto Siegenthaler, Ph.D., late of the University of Chicago, whose death aboard a trash-barge en route to Fresh Kills landfill eerily echoes that of his philosopher-friend.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/jurgen_habermas_is_dead/,"

"I’ll shoot straight with all y’all: I was born and bred in Georgia, a state whose famous red clay mirrors its perennial color on the political map. But I’m from Atlanta, that one blight of blue in a sea of perfect scarlet. While I can slip into the languid drawl of a southern belle at the drop of a camo-and-fishhook baseball hat, I normally maintain the accent of many an Atlantan – that is to say, none at all. I grew up going to church barbeques and then the latest “Van Gogh to Mondrian” exhibit at the High Museum.,All this to say: mere geography does not qualify me to expound upon the mysterious Princeton Rifle Club. I began my research with as many stereotypes of a backwards, gun-toting bunch of hicks as any cultured Manhattanite. Compounding this were rumors of a “Girls ‘n’ Guns” calendar of bikini-clad babes locked and loaded, so to speak, as well as a secret lair down in the (now doomed) Armory, a building noted mainly for its connection to ROTC and smelly herds of awkward OA frosh. Only the latter of these suspicions proved to be even remotely true, but they certainly spurred on my ill-founded curiosity. ,Even my first steps of research, however, began to prove my preconceptions wrong. The captain of the team, one Patrick Hough ’07, is majoring in Classics and Medieval Studies. I was intrigued by a rifle club captain whose academic passion lay with a past in which gunpowder existed only in the labs of some Chinese Taoist alchemists (thanks, Wikipedia!): clearly, the rifle club was going to confound my narrow expectations. ,When we finally arrived at an innocuous doorway along the Armory’s south wall, I was surprised by what I found inside. ,Best described as a combination between a hobbit-hole, a well-appointed 1950s nuclear fallout shelter, and the common room of a suite of sophomore guys (minus the cabinet full of rifles), the main room was surprisingly cozy. Sitting on top of the gun racks were the trophies and plaques which the team had won throughout the years, and the nondescript couch was strewn with Pequod packets and the like. ,Three members of the team greeted me. Besides Hough, I met range officer Paul Markoff ’09, hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina, and the resident whiz-kid on the team, Abigail Fong ’10. Markoff spoke with an easily identifiable Carolina twang and seemed to fit the profile of the typical gun-toting Southerner. Yet, I learned later in the afternoon that he is studying the ballsy linguistic combination of Arabic and Chinese while hoping to major in politics.,Fong, however, was the true surprise. Not only is she small, Asian, and from New York City, but she also sported black-heeled boots, and a “Gay? Fine by me” t-shirt. After her dad decided to restart his high-school rifle shooting game at the Empire State Games – an annual New York state event mimicking the Olympics – he fell in love with the sport again, began bringing his two daughters with him, and “the rest,” as Fong said, “was history.” Now, Fong has secured a spot on the American World Cup team and hopes to represent the U.S. of A at the 2008 Summer Olympics.,After introductions, Hough offered to let me shoot a few rounds on my own. As he rummaged around to find me earplugs and a beginner’s target, I nervously poked my head into the rifle range room to see what I was up against. Built after World War I, the range can accommodate the 50-foot span needed for shooting .22 rifles, as well as the shorter span of the air rifle. Wide, with low-ceilings, the room is lit only at its two ends, the one from which you shoot and the one which holds the targets. Piled in dully gleaming waves along the shooting line were what must have been hundreds of used bullet shells. By the door stood sentinel a lone American flag that would have looked more at home in an elementary school assembly hall than a rifle range. ,In fact, the whole place contained only that one piece of obvious patriotism. Though partially built with government money, the range and the club are separate from ROTC and the military. The team itself is only six years younger than the football team, making the rifle club a continuous presence on campus for about 125 years. Despite its longevity, the whole team gets less money from the University each year than Old Nassau happily spends on just one sprint football player. The sheer number of trophies I saw down in the rifle club’s lair versus the sheer number of losses accumulated by our benighted sprint team attests to the injustice inherent in our athletic system. ,After Captain Hough called a cease-fire in the range, I was introduced to another member of the team, Clint Montague ’09, and a delightful curmudgeon, Coach Joe Sundra. Short but bulky in his shooting jacket, Joe spoke with the trucks-over-gravel growl that one would expect of a 20-year rifle coaching veteran. Originally having worked in various labs throughout the University as technical support, Joe fell into coaching the team and has been a guiding presence ever since. ,As Hough and Markoff lined up my rifle on the sandbag and table used for beginners, Joe tried to impart some simple words of shooting wisdom to me. While I nervously smiled and nodded, all I could think about was my chronic inaccuracy. In church-league basketball, I would foul-out rather religiously, but I could never make more than a lay-up. I even failed the driving-in-reverse-in-a-straight-line segment of my driver’s test. Suddenly, my fear of shooting a gun was overwhelmed by my fear of humiliation: I could only pray that I might hit the target. ,With my first bullet locked into the chamber, I cautiously swung the rifle around to my target, lined up my sites so they were gunning for the bullseye, and, wincing, pulled the trigger. For those of you who have never shot a real gun before, it is rather exhilarating. I have no idea how a gun mechanically works its violent magic, but mentally, you feel pretty damn cool. The mindless motions of loading the gun and lining up the sites to the target are very soothing until you feel the shudder of power when the bullet is shot. In fact, to my shock and awe, I discovered that I had been only one ring away from the bullseye! After a few more rounds, I started hitting the very center consistently. This shooting thing is not too shabby, I thought. ,My rifle pipe dreams were quickly dashed, however, when the other team members were good enough to inform me of how a competition actually works. As I staggered under the weight of one of the real guns used, Hough and Markoff demonstrated the three positions: prone (lying on the ground), standing, and kneeling. In the space of two hours, each competitor must get off 20 rounds in each of these positions with only a 10-minute prep period beforehand. The NCAA matches, in which Princeton’s team competes, are highly competitive. ,Among NCAA teams, Princeton is the only representative of the Ivy League. All of our other elite brethren have disbanded their rifle teams because of the protests of more “liberal” students. Despite interest in restarting teams at several schools, administrations seem too scared of inciting some sort of Western-style campus show-down between gun-lovers and peace advocates. ,Yet, the diversity of the rifle club exposes the stereotyping hypocrisy of many “open-minded” students, myself previously included. As Fong’s shirt proudly declared, she does not seem in danger of using her Annie Oakley-like skills on members of the LGBT community. Captain Hough, himself a native of Guilford, Connecticut, is not even a member of that notorious political machine, the NRA. Perhaps, however, the example of recent alumnae speaks loudest. The former star of the rifle team, Lucy Jacobson ’06, could have pursued a professional career but instead opted to be a high school physics teacher, a position in dire need of qualified teachers. Another female rifle team alumna, Maia Schweizer ’04, is currently earning her master’s degree in earth sciences on a Marshall Scholarship, after majoring in geosciences with a visual arts certificate here at Princeton. These cases cannot but illustrate the ridiculous simplicity inherent in mentally typecasting anyone at this rich and varied school because of one easily misunderstood activity on their list.,The rifle team, however, does not have time to be concerned with their image on campus, as they have more pressing concerns. Their beloved headquarters is facing imminent demolition as the University prepares to flatten the Armory. Theoretically, every activity in the Armory that is losing its space must be given a comparable deal elsewhere, but Hough and his teammates know that they will have to fight for their bit. While the University hires former-NFL players to coach the sprint football team, a sport with a tradition at this school just as old as football’s is scrambling to continue. We “enlightened” students would do well to take stock of our equal-opportunity principles and consider the implications for such genuine passions of others that we may find hard to understand.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/target_practice/,"

"The first thing you should know is that my dorm room is 81 degrees. This is with the windows fully open, two fans going, and the lights off. My roommate and I refer to it as “the furnace.” At best, my sleep is fitful, at worst, sweaty and non-existent. The second thing is that I am senior—but not just any senior. Jane Austen might declare me as having “no prospects,” i.e. no job or job offers. Unlike my many already-employed peers, I must still labor under the illusion that my grades might actually count in my TBD future. Third, as a consequence of the second thing, I spend an inordinate amount of time in Firestone—“Harvey S.” or “F-stone,” as I affectionately call it. Like a squirrel hiding away nuts for winter, I have a cache of study spots on every floor, plus back-ups. I spend so much time in the library that, when one of the guards I know joked that he was going to marry me, I wondered for one moment too many if marital privileges would get me after-hours access to my carrel. ,Due to the above three facts about my life, I require more and more naps, and these naps tend to happen most often in F-stone. While I am always on the prowl for new napping spots, unfortunately I am a bit of a Goldilocks when it comes to napping conditions. My needs include, but are not limited to, a space that is: not too hot and not too cold; not too dark and not too light; relatively sequestered from the public eye; and readily available. Oh, and, did I mention it must be comfortable, too?,In light of the current exam season now under way, I thought I might tell the story of my quest for the perfect napping spot. Along the way, I will share my accumulated wisdom about Firestone, its several environs, and their inhabitants. ,Our first stop is the Trustees Room, that large and airy study space just off of the main lobby. Despite the intrusion of a few oblivious graduate students, this is truly the kingdom of the well-heeled and upwardly mobile among us. The room’s set-up is perfectly arranged for social observation. Its bi-level structure provides great viewing angles for the Trustees’ citizens to observe the casual-chic fashion statements of their neighbors, while the glass wall separating “Trustees” from the more plebian lobby allows for the monitoring of who is coming in and out of the library that day. I personally never go there except on good hair and outfit days—and I wouldn’t recommend otherwise. For those of you thinking of bickering come February, here is a study spot that will complement your all-important social maneuvering.,Unfortunately, napping in Trustees is really out of the question. The clatter of heels and printers; the public scrutiny; the many windows; the occasional but loud humming of wild-haired Paul Anderson: the room fails to meet any of my requirements. In order to find some beauty rest, we must look elsewhere. ,Before descending into the salt mines that are the A-C floors of Harvey S., let’s take a brief turn on the oft-neglected third floor. Here is the total opposite of Trustees: quiet, dark, and musty, with only the soft footsteps of a dying breed breaking the silence. In carrels and desks pushed up against walls, you will find them in their aerie above the fray of the rest of the library and, indeed, the post-Byzantine world: the classics majors. Their Old World discipline imbues the place with a solemnity that would seem to create the best nap atmospherics, except for one thing: a lack of readily available and comfortable spots. Perhaps classicists would rather adopt the Spartan approach to napping, plopping their weary heads on the pillow of their Plato or Plutarch instead of a couch. In any event, the only comfortable chairs are in the well-lit, well-frequented African-American Studies room, and I think we can do better. ,As we make our way downstairs, we can peek at the reading room at the back of the main floor. Unlike the third floor, the sleeping arrangements here are almost perfect with an array of squishy couches and chairs to choose from. This room and its accoutrements, however, are no secret, and it is tough to find an open spot during peak times. Furthermore, this area seems to be a hot spot for any number of strange community auditors, including the aforementioned Mr. Anderson, who likes to use the computers right outside the reading room. As nice as the couches might be (when they are available), I rest uneasy there, afraid that some old person will sit on my head by accident or Paul will have a conniption fit nearby. Normally, after a brief glance into that room, I keep going downstairs to the lower levels of F-stone.,I must admit. I have a real fondness for the B-floor, especially since my carrel is now there. I know many seniors despise their carrels, but I think it is all a matter of how you use it. Mine is like the grown-up version of my junior high locker: a holding spot for all of my books that is decorated with pictures and memorabilia from my life on the outside of the library. Plus, I can play music and videos with no headphones! I don’t do much work in my carrel, of course, but that’s not the point. Instead, it is a sanctuary, a refuge. ,Surprisingly, this refuge is none too good for naps, for the same reason as the third-floor: lack of comfort. Though the privacy factor is huge, I have found that I cannot curl up on two metal chairs and sleep for more than about two minutes. Since my optimal naptime is 25-30 minutes, this is clearly unacceptable. The rest of the B-floor is also fairly barren, populated only with desks, tables, and stacks. One oasis exists—the Holden Room, across from the Scrivener Reading Room—but even then the pickings are slim. Often, the Holden room is occupied and its sleeping spots militaristic, with skimpy cushions over hard wood. ,Below, the C-floor is even more inhospitable to a well-earned rest. Over the break, I watched a lot of the “Planet Earth” series on DVD, and I realized that the C-Floor is like Firestone’s version of an arctic tundra: cold, uncomfortable, and subject to vast migrations during January and May. Here is where the truly studious (or desperate) reside. If you are going to walk down all of those stairs and forgo natural light, you are not going to waste your sacrifice on a nap. Accordingly, the place is filled with the same array of desks, carrels, and tables as the B-floor but without even the puny oasis of another Holden Room to provide shelter from the bleak habitat all around. No napping to be had here. ,It seems like we have exhausted almost all of the options in Firestone, without much luck. But, wait, you might say, what about the A-floor? What about it, indeed. For a long time, I discounted this whole floor, filled, as I saw it, by those students who like to study such silly things as “graphs,” “data sets,” and “concrete, practical research.” The Reserve Room and the Social Science Research Center seemed perfect for these boring people, both rooms resembling the cubicle-littered spaces parodied on “The Office,” but without any of the quirky fun. The harsh florescent lighting and rows of desks are not conducive to peaceful sleeping. ,Right when I thought I had F-stone all figured out, however, it suddenly surprised me. On the hunt for a particular World Bank report for my term paper in my first (and only) Woody Woo class, I found myself dumbly wandering the far reaches of the A-floor stacks, a place I had never before explored. As I turned a corner, not entirely sure where I was, I saw it: my napping Holy Grail. There, by the Hellenic Studies Graduate Room, were two over-sized and over-stuffed armchairs. Moving closer, unsure if the decades-old dust was playing tricks on my eyes, I realized that here was the culmination of all I had been seeking. The place was just cool enough for a cozy jacket- or scarf-blanket, dimly lit only by some natural light coming through a window, clearly out of the public eye, and, hallelujah, when the two chairs were pushed together, it was comfortable. With a sigh of pleasure, I instantly abandoned my book search and curled up for the perfect 27-minute snooze. As Goldilocks herself might have said, this place was just right.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/napquest/,"

"While Facebook stalking this week instead of writing that Dean’s Date paper, you might come across pictures of Rachel Price ’07 in a wedding dress. These photos won’t be from an impromptu trip to the Salvation Army to giggle with friends about being married some day: these are from that actual wedding day. On December 16, 2006, the first weekend of winter break, Rachel and Rick Apple ’05 were married in Nashville, Tennessee at a church brimming with evergreens, crimson roses, ruby red apples, and many of their Princeton friends. After honeymooning at Grand Cayman and spending the holidays with their two families, the Apples have moved into married housing at Spelman to begin their life as a new family.,How does such a story happen at Princeton, a place of ambitious over-achievers angling for that first quintile GPA and prestigious summer job by day and getting, like, totally wasted at the Street by night? Not only did Rachel and Rick stay together after he graduated her sophomore year and took a travel-intensive consulting job, but they also got married in the middle of her senior year. I asked Rachel the obvious question: “Why now?” With a quick smile, she fired back: “We wanted to be married!” After Rick proposed on April 16 of last year, which was Easter Sunday, they started thinking about possible dates. While they did consider waiting until Rachel graduated in June, they quickly realized that to add wedding planning on top of Rachel’s thesis, graduation and Reunions was absurd. Plus, they wanted to be sure that as many of their Princeton friends as possible could come and be a part of the ceremony, making June a doubly inconvenient time. ,So December it was. Rachel knows that being married in college is a sacrifice and will make her experience at Princeton unique among her peers, but “the blessing of marriage out-weighs this.” Rachel and her new husband, however, have always been a bit different. As “very Christian,” a rather funny phrase students on campus often use to describe practicing Christians of all stripes, the Apples have a distinct attitude towards dating that goes beyond hooking up at the Street and maybe getting Frist pizza together later. At the beginning of their relationship, Rick told Rachel over coffee at Café Viv, “I’d really like to date you,” with dating defined as “pursuing the possibility of marriage in a God-centric relationship.” ,Because of her engagement ring and changed status on campus, Rachel started hearing about and running into other people in similar situations. While most of them are seniors, she did meet a 21-year old freshman on the hockey team who was also married, Bradley Schroeder. As members of the Mennonite Brethren (a modern branch of the Amish faith) who grew up in Drake, Sasketchewan, Canada, Brad and his wife Casadi also experienced long-term separation when Casadi lived for Bolivia for a year and Brad played junior hockey for three years. They also had the same philosophy toward dating, believing that these separations were God’s way of maturing them as a couple and preparing them for marriage. Though they handled the distance “painfully” and Brad proposed to Casadi before knowing if he had gotten into Princeton, they now live in a Bloomberg kitchen-suite and share a meal plan. Casadi even babysits for some of the University deans. ,While this “God-centric” dating concept might seem totally foreign and antiquated to many students, it hints at why the preponderance of married students on Princeton’s campus seems to be highly religious, whether Christian, Orthodox Jew, or Muslim. Perhaps, living a religious life that often emphasizes self-sacrifice and putting another above one’s self creates the right mind-set for marriage earlier than most at a school like Princeton, where so much of our time and energy is focused – not entirely without good reason – on doing what needs to be done for just our self. As the Bright Eyes song “First Day of My Life” puts it: “I’d rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery.” Religious students perhaps enter college pre-disposed to make the compromises necessary for marriage, instead of waiting for lightning to strike.,Many Princeton students, however, do assume that the bolt of true love will strike them during their four years at Old Nassau. On the bus ride to our drop-off point during my OA trip freshman year, several of the older leaders were dispensing their wisdom to us freshman about romance at Princeton. “Oh, yeah,” they would say, “people here either just ‘hook-up’ or are in serious relationships. But you know, 70% of Princeton students marry other Princeton students.” Suddenly, the atmosphere on the bus changed. Sneakily, we all began eyeing each other across the aisles, in our oh-so-attractive old t-shirts and hiking shorts.,Surprisingly, this myth of 70% (or 92% if you are one of my unnamed but crazy seminar professors) was more than a horror story told by our intrepid OA leaders. The marriage statistic rumor has certainly achieved certified campus myth status among students. Often, the story goes, this 70% don’t actually meet or date while students at Princeton. Rather, it is at Reunions that matches in Orange and Black heaven are made. I don’t know how many of those people have actually been to Reunions, but if I’m supposed to swoon over the drunk and sketchy 28 year old i-banker trying to freak dance with me on the 5th Reunion dance floor while DJ Bob spins 50 Cent, I’d prefer to be one of the 30% who marries out of the fold, thanks. ,Beyond one example of a current and a former Tower Vice President who hit it off at last year’s Reunions but are neither married nor engaged, I was never to able to find in my highly extensive and thorough research any more instances of the supposed Reunions love connection. Of course, Princetonians can also find other Princetonians at the myriad number of alumni clubs around the world and alumni events that I already get e-mails about. Plus, the Princetonian-marrying-Princetonian cycle could self-perpetuate itself through Princeton weddings. What more romantic spot to find that fellow Princeton alum a few years out of college, ready to be settled and looking for someone with similar backgrounds and interests?,Yet, even these opportunities for Tiger lovin’ can’t account for a marriage rate of 70%. Determined to discover the real percentage behind the campus myth, I turned to the alumni office, thinking that they surely keep tabs on these sorts of things. Eventually, I got in touch with Princeton spokeswoman Cass Cliatt ’96. To my surprise, Ms. Cliatt told me in an e-mail that actually, “Arriving at a truly accurate count of Princeton graduates who name as their spouses other graduates is difficult because we must rely on self-reporting, and alumni have no obligation to tell us of their partnership status.” Still she did have some numbers to give me. From a total of 63,639 living alumni since the first co-ed class of 1970 as of December 2006, a whopping 4,630 have reported their partner as an alumnus as well. Instead of 70%, that amounts to a staggering 7.3%. Even with a generous margin of error of 20-30 points, the Princetonian marriage statistic myth fulfils the prime characteristic of any urban legend: extreme exaggeration. If we include all 85,658 living alumni in the calculation, the number drops to 5.4%. ,Perhaps it has to do with the kind of people who come to a school like Princeton. Over winter break, several of my hometown friends in serious relationships began talking about how they have started discussing getting engaged and the very long term with their “partners.” Yet, the opposite kind of conversation often seems to happen at Princeton. While we like the security of boyfriends and girlfriends and special friends, we don’t want to invest too deeply in them. There are so many other things we “need” to be doing: excellent academic work, traveling abroad, securing jobs and fellowships, and fulfilling all of those dreams of excitement and adventure we’ve had since we first entered an accelerated pre-school. Where does the life of someone else, whose needs will influence every decision you make, fit in with all of these plans and carefully scheduled aspirations?,The Reunions myth plays into this idea of a timeline: after being a few years out of college, having started the career ball rolling and sowed our wild oats, now we are ready to look for someone who will appreciate our intellectual quirks as well as our sense of humor and fine eyes. Yet, as every story with an ounce of romance tells us, love doesn’t happen according to schedule. As Harry says to Sally in the sappy classic “When Harry Met Sally,” “When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of the life to start as soon as possible.” Maybe the religious couples on campus, through their different faiths’ common focus on God’s plan over our own, don’t have such a “schedule,” but rather a readiness for that right person. While many students may not follow a particular religion or even understand those who do, perhaps they can still appreciate the high moral value placed upon self-sacrifice as necessary for a sustainable and meaningful relationship. Being open to such a relationship while at college might even put some of us in that 7.3%. As my favorite Prince Charming said, “The readiness is all.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/dearly_beloved/,"

"I’ve finally begrudgingly admitted to myself that I am a bad writer. I’m particularly bad at writing dialogue, which I suppose underscores that I am a horrendous conversationalist, by which I mean I am hopelessly self-involved. I find this particularly unfortunate, because I regularly come up with ideas for novels and plays and stories and otherwise fictional things. Now, in fairness, all of these ideas are purely formal, and probably oughtn’t ever be written–or, rather, as anyone who actually knows or cares about such things would say, are quite beside the point. But, then again, most everything sucks, and the fact that there’s some sort of highfalutin conceit means that, even if it sucks, at least the author can feel superior to the sucky stories that have a moral lesson, or are truthful, or something dull like that. But I can’t write. So here they are–maybe one of you will write one of them:  ,1. A play where every line is immediately followed by another line referring back to that first one, with the same speaker. See, this has all sorts of wonderful little tricks. For instance: are the actors aware that fully half of their speech is self-referential? When a question is asked, and then commented upon, does the interlocutor respond to the question or the comment? Imagine the soliloquies! ,2. A short story wherein the characters start out shouting and gradually become quieter and quieter until they can’t hear each other and have to guess what they’re saying based on lip-reading. Presumably there would be an actual reason for this change, like, say, they start out on the subway and go to a movie. They would probably be dating. Definitely lesbians. The irony would be that they understand each other better when they can’t hear each other. The banality of this irony would be noted by the narrator, who subsequently will start inserting his own opinions in order to prevent the author from being so facile.,3. The diary of a small sixty-two-year-old woman who lives in southeastern Alaska but has the delusion that she is in fact a wealthy venture capitalist’s son who is slowly developing dementia and osteoporosis, and fears grizzly bears irrationally. Feeling that this suggests some sort of vocation, he (she) begins to write a fictional diary about a small sixty-two-year-old woman who lives in northeastern Alaska but has the delusions that she (he) is in fact a syphilitic jazz guitarist in Austin, Texas. The work would alternate between a crazy sick dying woman’s and a young capitalist’s diary each chapter. This would be an enjoyable read.,4. The story of a female writer of role playing video games whose life is consumed by alcohol and cocaine and anorexia, despite the fact that, as a female writer of RPG video games, she is admired and creepily lusted after by thousands of awkward adolescent gamers, and is considered attractive by males. The entire novel, however, would be written as a conversation tree, which means that every paragraph is written four times, and then one is selected. It’s ambiguous whether the protagonist is aware that her life is a conversation tree, or the fact that her stats and level are kept track of in the margin. I’m unsure as to whether her inventory or party should be included. Probably they should be included. ,5. A novel written in that typo-laden, angsty drunk email/IM style which we all know and love. Except it’s being written by some Sumerian scribe hyped-up on khat. The fact that he is hyped-up on khat is mentioned often, as his drug-addiction both makes him anathema in Uruk and means that his tablet keeps drying out while he’s writing.,6. A three part novel in which each part is an account of a modern mystery play written by a gifted writer who does not realize that he is watching a mystery play instead. Astonished at the intensity of these people’s lives and the probity of their speech, he  feels compelled to write novels in their honor. There is an epilogue detailing the messy lawsuit which ruins the writer’s career that is written by the writer, who vehemently defends the artistic integrity of his novelizations and argues that it was no more or less dishonest than a story “based on a true story.” The fact that he is lying and that he didn’t realize he was writing novelizations of plays is made obvious, but not acknowledged by him, the writer. His gifted writing and innate guilelessness is belied: the reader is satisfied, goes to bed.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/my_writers_block/,"

"The first time I smoked a cigarette, I was sardined with six other middle-school aged girls in a shower of my boarding school dorm. The logic was that if Matron caught us lighting up we would hastily strip down, turn on the faucet, and pretend that we were just casually showering together in the middle of the night. Thus we would escape punishment.,At my very British, very Catholic school, fourteen-year-old lesbians were preferred to smokers. ,And so, early on, I encountered the irrational judgments that non-smokers pass on us delinquents. We stand outside in the cold, glaring at passersby, daring them to question the logic of our Parliament Lights or Camel Turkish Blends. They present what all smokers have heard ad nauseum as if it it’s going to change our behavior. “It’s going to kill you” they say, “You smell like cancer sticks” or, my personal favorite from a member of my family, “No one is going to marry you if you keep that up.” Yeah, thanks guys. Maybe the next time you tell me it’ll have an effect. ,I understand that these words usually stem from their desire to look out for me and not have me end my life as a laryngectomee. But what they and the other cantankerous non-smokers don’t get is that every smoker you see in entryways made a choice to start smoking and daily makes a choice to continue to smoke. Quitting is difficult, but not impossible. I myself was smoke-free for two and a half whole years before choosing to pick it up again. ,Like every other politically contentious ‘lifestyle’ choice – the choice to live as the humiliated submissive in a BDSM relationship, or the choice to go quail hunting with a gun purchased at Wal-Mart – it really should be tolerated in this lovely, free, and progressive country. You can be a part of the Aryan Nation online discussion groups if you so desire, arguing about the precise proportions of the hakenkreuz. Personally, I think that sort of thing should be discouraged through educational programs. Some politicians, like mayor Barry Groveman of Calabasas, California, think that time could be better spent “protecting the public from smoking and tobacco-related litter and pollution…by affirming and promoting the family-friendly atmosphere of the City’s public places” as it states in Ordinance number 2006-217 of the Calabasas City Council Agenda. This town is outlawing smoking altogether. How blissfully authoritarian of them. ,Now, I’m all for family-friendly, and I really make an effort not to smoke in front of children. I have informed the underage members of my family about the dangers of smoking, but I do not think that they will be forever scarred if once in their protected lives they happen to catch a whiff of smoke. Not in excess, of course, as secondhand smoke is just as deadly as the kind I like, but Groveman and his council want to enforce that “No person shall Smoke in an area in which Smoking is otherwise permitted by this chapter or other law within a Reasonable Distance from any entrance, opening, crack, or vent into an Enclosed Area in which Smoking is prohibited by this chapter.” ,Ridiculous. How many smokers do you know who blow smoke through vents solely to irk the non-smokers within? Frankly, most of us feel guilty enough about possibly endangering the rest of the healthy populace without deliberately smoking into cracks and vents. The ordinance can be upheld by both police officers and peace officers, giving the non-smokers of the town the law on their side. Smell smoke? Don’t just glare at the nicotine whore, arrest him! The city will charge him $250. ,This is not progress. This would make George Orwell say, “I totally called that one”. ,So I wonder what the future holds for the smoking faction of Princeton, which currently seeks refuge in Terrace and the East Pyne courtyard. Will other towns, including Princeton, follow the Calabasas example? Will Public Safety soon form a Smokers Arrest Brigade? Will they carry around pint-sized fire extinguishers to put out my ciggy the night before a final?,I don’t know. But I do know that Mayor Groveman has not taken into account the allure of the forbidden on Calabasas youth. If smoking had not been so vilified back when my only smoking haven was a shower perhaps I wouldn’t have started. I don’t worry too much about the teenage populace of Calabasas, however. There are other much safer ways for them to rebel. Don’t take my word for it, though. Ask the Aryan Nation.  Perhaps Groveman would prefer that sort of lifestyle choice to my own.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/thank_you_for_smoking/,"

"The first stop was, logically, Hall 5, probably the best hall of the convention and the home for current video game titans Microsoft and Nintendo. Microsoft’s entry into the video game market is a recent development to this writer who remembers the days of debating whether Genesis or Super Nintendo was the superior system, but as I walked around the faux beaches of “Xbox 360 Island,” I liked what I saw. There were the next generation of guitar games, where a player strummed a faux guitar along with music on the screen; the cords of nostalgia tugged at me as I saw an updated version of four-player Bomberman multiplayer. I played the SNES version weekly as a middle-schooler, and still occasionally meet with former roommates to play when both my need for a confidence-booster and my tolerance for getting controllers thrown at me are high. The line was too long, though, and I wasn’t really here to play video games, besides. What most struck me were the Microsoft workers milling around the “island” – a raised platform of Astroturf with some sand, X-Box 360s, and plasma screen TVs thrown on it to make for a comfy gaming center. Unlike the gamers they served and doled out advice to (although I imagine they knew less about some of the products than some of the creatures here today), they were almost all beautiful. None of the girls working the Microsoft island must have been more than twenty-five years old, and they were all dressed in white top, white Capri outfits that did more for their fit bodies than either of the aforementioned sweatshirt looks. They were all either Scandinavian-looking blond beasts, or more olive-colored Spanish-looking girls, and I don’t think it was a coincidence that they outnumber their male counterparts, all handsome, fit German men in their early twenties dressed in male versions of the white-on-white outfit. Elsewhere at Nintendo’s stand, I saw the same fashion philosophy in action: again, a mix of Nordic and Latin girls and Central European guys, although there the girls seemed to have a mandatory pastel-colored scarf as belt to complete the ensemble, while the men all wore baby-blue belts and smart glasses to round it all off. They knew what they were talking about when it came to video games, they liked to show that they played video games, and they were sexy and cool. Life was great!,I moved on to the Nintendo stand, and here the main attraction was the Wii, Nintendo’s answer to Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Sony’s Playstation 3. Nintendo has, wisely I think, tried to make the Wii as customizable to the user as possible: I saw a Penelope Cruz look-alike demonstrating to a short, ugly girl dressed up in Gothic gear how to design her avatar for all of her future Wii activities: select your hair length here, your skin tone there, your eyebrows here, your height there, and after some endless customization, you had a cartoon character that looked like you; when you went online, you could meet other people in a Wii forum and start conversations with them based on how their avatars looked, and they with you for the same reasons, but this wasn’t just limited to signing on to the system. As people sampled the Wii’s sports games (boxing and tennis seemed to be the big hits), your Wii character was the one in the boxing match; rather than being forced to take over some blaxploitation character in your pursuit of boxing glory, you could now box your friends – and enemies – using not just the Wii’s three-dimensional controller, but also your own avatar. Personalization, it seemed to me, was making my old SNES friends of Crono, Aeris, and Cloud obsolete. Why not, after all, just insert yourself into a game? If the popularity of online role playing games at Leipzig was any indication, people didn’t care much if their games had any fixed plot: what they wanted was to be immersed into a game world, and the more it was about them, the less it was about any black man with a gatling gun for an arm (Barrett of “Final Fantasy 7”) or a world-traveling gambler with an airship (Setzer of “Final Fantasy 6”) or the gigantic stuffed animal controlled by a robotic cat (Cait Sith of “Final Fantasy 7”) – well, then, all the better. Traditional characters, it seems to me, are out; immersiveness and narcissistic plot are in.,I was getting tired, so I said down at a leather couch (the same white hue as the Penelope Cruz look-alike’s capirs) and picked up a Nintendo DS tethered to the furniture: finally, some time to actually see how video games had changed first hand. I had owned a Game Boy and played “Pokémon: Blue Version” when popular thought dictated that the game was just for children, and so I had some experience with handhelds, but as I tried to operate this monstrosity, I soon understood why my Dad had been so bad every time I challenged him to a race of Mario Kart in the past. More than having two screens (hence its name: Dual Screen) the DS had not just the usual array of Game Boy-style buttons on the front, but several triggers on the back, and yet no matter what I seemed to press, I couldn’t get anything to happen. , yelled a stereotype of a professor on the screen. “Touch! Touch!” Well, no shit, but what? Finally, I just tried pressing the screen – it turns out the DS was also a touchscreen – and we started to get somewhere. Trying to use some of the new controllers at the Games Convention made me feel old.,There was good reason why my DS had been the untouched one. As I bumbled with my fingers to get back to the main screen of the game, “English Training,” I began to see that Nintendo was beginning not to limit itself to just entertainment. This was a German game for people looking to improve their English, and it took advantage of all of the DS’ features: as I made my way to “exercises” (,), I noticed the stylus lying on the couch that belonged to the DS. Suddenly the handheld started talking to me.,“Good afternoon,” it said to me in a charming female South British accent. The thing could talk, and with a British accent! Not bad. As a set of prompts and the voice explained to me, I was to get a German sentence on the screen, but hear the English translation, and then I would have to write the sentence on the screen using the stylus. “I don’t like dogs;” “May I smoke?” “That’s cool!” (,) The handwriting recognition software wasn’t great, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever need to say those three sentences in that order, but games – if you called it a game – were needed to keep up with the flood of entertainment every year. Even though this was the biggest games convention in the world, video games today have become a largely English-speaking venture. Of course, there were the days of bad translations from the Japanese for the Final Fantasy games, but many of the most popular games at the convention seemed to primarily operate in English; sure, the sexy things back at the Nintendo stand had told you how to work “Wii Bowling,” but the point was that the instructions were in English (or Japanese, if you wanted), and there wasn’t always room for even fairly-widely spoken (and affluent) languages like German or French in these games. This might partly explain the popularity of massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), games like “World of Warcraft” and “Dark Age of Camelot” where clan members get together to go on quests in a medieval world and occasionally raid other races’ bases. I remember looking over a massive “Warcraft III” tournament during a presentation later in the today to see a flood of German chat going over the game’s chat window: “,” (“So, should we launch the attack?”,***",http://www.nassauweekly.com/a_brief_account_of_the_leipzig_games_convent2/,"

"On the eve of World War I, an aged Alice checks into a Swiss hotel, carrying with her a large looking glass. Next door, Wendy, still reminiscing over Peter Pan, lies side by side with her dry, buttoned-up husband. Later in the night, Dorothy, her long red hair from her days in the Land of Oz cut short into a flapper-girl bob, rents a room of her own. The three women, all sharing a childhood seeped in fantasy, take a liking to each other and become fast friends. In Alan Moore’s new comic book epic, ,, Dorothy, Alice and Wendy precede to masturbate, suck, screw, tickle, buck, lick, caress and, yes, even fist each other over the course of three volumes as Europe dissolves into chaos around them. The women share the intimate secrets of their childhood fantasy worlds, which as they are evoked come more and more to resemble complex coping mechanisms, flights of exploration, imaginative discoveries of the body and dangerous gambits with the murk of desire. The illustrations, all wonderfully conceived by Moore’s wife Melinda Gebbie, often hearken back to artists of the period like Egon Schiele and Alfonse Mucha. The fantasies interweave Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe and the erotic booklets of Victorian-era England and Europe. The women wax philosophical about war, politics, maleness, the family, lesbianism, youth and, of course, imagination, and the plot revels so thoroughly in their sexual play that the line between reality and fantasy obscures and eventually fades completely away. ,Alan Moore, if you have not yet heard, is the reigning master of contemporary comics. His graphic novels , are commonly cited as among the most literate and creative comic books available, and his serials such as , and , are continually top rate. For those of you who have not been reading comic books since you were 12, a brief summary of recent events is necessary to appreciate the importance of Moore’s new pornographic epic. ,Comic books, back in the days of yore, when men stood tall and women were chesty, belonged to super heroes, pre-historic warriors, samurais, cowboys, urban killers, motorcyclists on fire, humanoid reptiles, universe crushers, bullet-eaters, outrageous breasts, slick young sidekicks, secret identities and trembling, threatened civilians. Adventures were brief, plot twists abrupt, facial expressions exaggerated and evil consistently defeated again and again and again. In the late eighties, a disgruntled underground that had been seething and bubbling since the seventies broke into this shimmering world of male energy and everything got a lot more complex. Superheroes began to question their “underlying motivations” and developed “emotional insecurities.” Grant Morrison’s , focused on the conception of reality inherent in the comic mentality. Neil Gaiman’s , toyed with Jungian archetypes and the philosophical interplay of concept-gods. Sam Kieth’s , explored the tattered landscape of a homeless superhero’s subconscious. Yet the reigning king of this foray into the dark side of fantasy was inarguably Alan Moore. A known kook, Moore resisted the mainstream fiercely, issuing acid declarations of dissatisfaction with the standard tropes of the Marvel and DC universe. As a 15 year old, I revered him as a genuine artist, one who took the fantasy available in comics and ran off into the wilderness, yammering mystically and pawing at his wild beard. ,Recently, in the past six or seven years, comic books have taken a strange turn with the emergence of the Graphic Novel. The term which was once used to refer to collected editions of long-running series is now reserved for bookish, adult material which leaves the realm of the superhero far behind in order to focus on people, employment, puberty, parenting and…I shudder to say it…relationships. These comics are not, as you might suspect, the logical progression from the complexity of Moore’s revolution, rather they are a product of aspiring novelists who grew up reading comics. Usually these Graphic Novels are about comic artists. Usually they feature fights between the artist and his girlfriend. Often there are extended scenes of the lonely artist masturbating. No joke. These Graphic Novels are the daily bread, as well as the poster child, for a growing community of hip cosmopolitan graduates who want to read literature without seeming too adult. I loathe these fools. I hope they all stub their toes real hard. The bankruptcy of spirit that these comics embody marks the death knell of creativity in one of the last remaining mediums to encourage the inner child to shine forth in all of its glory. Which brings us to ,.,Moore’s Alice, who when we meet her is a wizened, grey-haired libertine, recounts her childhood as one of forced sexual confrontation leading quickly to lesbian prostitution and a fierce opium dependency. In one particularly disturbing scene, she is forced to spend a weekend between the corpulent bodies of two mentally challenged twins, Moore’s allusion to Tweedledum and Tweedledee: “they made me sleep with my face in one of their crotches, so that I’d lick their mephitic holes in the morning, or when they woke at night needing to pee.” The imagery of the fat twins hearkens back to a consistent trope in Alice’s recollections, that of reflection and symmetry. In her first tale, the young Alice focuses on the mirror as her tutor (read Lewis Carroll) touches her. “All that I could see was Mother’s mirror, there across the room. Inside me fingers fluttered, strange birds in a deep salt pool, their movements making ripples I could neither name nor own. The birds moved faster, caught up in a race.” Alice reaches out towards her own reflection. “I fell, and from the hole’s far end she fell towards me, half bare, hair like wild rape, white lace petals opening about her skinny legs. His hand was hot between my thighs. I made pretence that it was hers.” The twin Alices grapple with each other, seeking refuge and solace and, strangely, somewhat disturbingly, pleasure in the ministrations of her tutor. ,The adult Alice considers herself “half-mad,” for she cannot imagine sleeping with a man, preferring as a matter of course the sexual company of women and girls. As an interpretation of Carroll’s work this is fascinating. It has long been a consideration of any adult reading of his books to question his obsession with the young girl. To imagine his elaborate creations as sexual advances is no stretch, but then to perceive Alice’s flight into a narcissistic fantasyland as an emotional response is to read into Carroll’s own action, his own appetitive appeal, a pained comprehension of Alice’s dismay. It hearkens back, or forward, to Humbert Humbert’s acute awareness of Lolita’s crisis, the true sin at the heart of that book. Alice’s later struggles with forced lesbian encounters allow Moore further room to explore this surreal terrain of numb trauma and intense pleasure. After finishing one of her stories, Alice asks if Dorothy is “enjoying these accounts of very young girls in actually rather frightening circumstances?” “Yeah. I sure am,” Dorothy says from between Wendy’s legs, “It’s just so dirty!” ,And in this response we find the thesis of the whole bizarre project. The pleasure of delight and entertainment, which Moore argues finds its highest expression in the erotic, does certainly exist even in the face of “actually rather frightening circumstances.” Comic books have, believe you me, always contained a great deal of sex, whether explicit or tucked into a spandex costume. Rippling biceps punching through bricks and snatching up damsels is as loud an expression of pubescent energy as you could ask for. To challenge the comic medium, then, at its base level, would be to bring this sensual appeal to the forefront, to create a comic that is not erotic but blaringly pornographic, and to expose this raw nerve to the full force of human drama. The pivotal event of , is the execution of Archduke Ferdinand, and the comic ends with the glistening, fleshy entrails of a soldier in the trenches. Yet the mystery of the imagination, wrapped up as it is in desire, fear, enchantment and delirium, is as much a function of life in wartime as in childhood. “My dear,” Alice says to Wendy at one point, “beautiful and imaginative things can be destroyed. Beauty and imagination cannot. They blossom, even in wartime.” This appeal to the necessity of imagination and fantasy could not come at a better time, in my opinion, and indeed , is at heart very in tune with Thomas Pynchon’s latest book, ,. Both works challenge the notion of the serious, the adult, the mature, etc. Lost Girls is, in my opinion, a resounding smack in the face to all of these Graphic Novels, and as such is no less than a triumph for comic books. ,If you don’t feel like paying $75 for a three volume porn comic, I’ll let you peek at my copy.

"Perhaps the best word to describe this year’s Junior Independent Work exhibition is “diverse”. In the Lucas Gallery of that bastion of campus creativity, 185 Nassau Street, one finds everything from Clara Wong’s colorful, abstract watercolors to an installation-video piece by Jessica Inocencio featuring a video projected onto a screen fitted behind a car door.,Of the traditional pieces, several big pieces by Caroline James capture the eye with vividly colored oils and Impressionist influences; the blurry-edged figures and careful replication of the effects of light on objects are at once abstract and super-realistic. The portrait face, with highly textured daubs of oil paint on a large square canvas, especially arresting in size and dynamic brush techniques.,But if Andy Warhol-type symbolism is more your style, then to the immediate right find Emily Thornton’s oil-paint pastiches of magazine glamour girls, textile patterns, and snippets of advertisement captions. Despite the presence of clearly recognizable figures, the flesh of Thornton’s haute couture girls, when juxtaposed with the geometric patterns of cloth and text, become as mysterious and surreal as Jason Murphy’s super-8 track, “V”, featuring 20 minutes of silent black-and-white film in five parts, shot entirely in Seattle. “I used establishing shots in between each of the five movements to loosely link the portraits [of the city],” said Murphy, “[my] goal was to create a visual rhythm in each movement.” Jessica Inocencio, creator of Window Seat, which, according to her own written description, “combines video and sculpture characteristics” by “focus[ing] on the car window as a common way of viewing and framing the world.”,For the lover of pure color and shape, Clara Wong’s watercolors and oils experiment with the abstraction and beauty of textured patterns. Contrasts between the linear and circular, the dull and bright, form the basis of her works. Drips, swirls, and organic shapes dominate these works.  ,When asked about the Princeton visual arts program as a whole, senior Murphy called the faculty and staff “pretty fantastic” and “supportive” but qualified the praise by noting that there is “not really enough” of an emphasis on fine arts in general. Despite “everybody knowing each other pretty well”, Murphy added that funds for his video projects were scarce, and that he was in fact the first student to work on a video project for the independent project in recent years.  As innovative as the student artists might be, without sufficient support and resources, their success, and that of the Princeton fine arts community, must remain limited.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/artistic_license/,"

"I remember the most beautiful party I have ever attended. It was held in a loft up-town. It was night-time, when the streets are brighter than the buildings and the eye is drawn slowly down, and I could see the Columbia University Observatory, a golf ball lit from below by the street-lights and reverberating with the sound of pedestrian traffic. The park is appealing when seen from large loft windows, but in the twilight it looks like so much blue, with islands of green under the yellow of lamps. I remember that the party was in celebration of a film’s completion, but I cannot recall any actors or a director. The producer was undoubtedly my Uncle Steven or one of his friends. ,My early introduction to parties was the fault of my Uncle Steven and his companions. My sister and I became the attractive adopted children of a swanky homosexual elite. At every party we wore matching outfits and explained, in very measured and slow sentences, how much fun we were having. And we were having a ball, in truth.,My sister is singularly beautiful. She is an example of manner and grace. She has a practiced etiquette that borders on anti-social, and her poise and carriage is nothing short of superb. She is, to quote our mutual friend Topher, a work-of-art even while sleeping. Yet only I have seen her sleeping, and I can attest to the fact that she is roguish and clever to a fault, and has been since we were young gay apprentices. Her name is Lily, and I am eleven months her senior. I am the only one who will remember her smile as she put on her first pair of red stockings, a smile both wild and respectful and gorgeous, so absolutely gorgeous. ,At this most beautiful party we wore gold. I wore a shimmering, prodigal vest over a burgundy shirt while Lily wore a matching gold dress with a red necklace. Our siblinghood preceded us, as it does to this day, wherever we went, informing each room of our presence before we entered. Prance lightly, our Uncle would always whisper, for it is the only way to prance.,Towards the end of this most beautiful evening, when the murmur of laughter rises in conclusive delight, I see her, my Lily, leaning against the glass of the window, a seven year old smoking a cigarette. I see her right now as if she were here, I see her leaning into me, a bit tipsy, smelling like smoke and sand and trees and taking my hand. I’m ready to take my leave, she says, looking at her stocking feet, and I want to take you with me. Then quickly she looks at me and kisses me with dry lips, holding onto my neck. Needless to say I took her home, as was my charge.,“And is there a mans involved?” Herb says with flair. His legs are crossed and his sunglasses hide half of his face.,“Nope, no mans. It’s…It’s a new leaf, and there is a possible job offer. Though she is being overly optimistic about it, in my opinion.” I blow into my coffee. Today I am full of opinions. I woke up this morning with a clear and crisp plan for my day. I was to take my dirties to the dry cleaner, where I would pick up my suit if the tailor was done. The tailor was Eastern European and entirely unreliable. Then I was to call up Jemima for a sporadic and half-romantic walk to lunch in this café on the park. She’s a friend, Jemima, and the romance would be quiet and subdued and, with luck, self-evident. She would be forced to consider her options, and possibly wish she had made different choices in the past. The dry cleaning and suit pick-up went smoothly enough to inspire mild optimism, but Jemima was regrettably booked all afternoon. I was forced to call Herb and have been brooding, sullen and full of opinions since noon.,“Ooh, a job offer. Doing what? Oh, let me guess. A social attaché? An internship with a designer?” Herb smiles into the sun and pushes his huge sunglasses up on his nose. ,“Nothing so glamorous. She might be able to TA at a university there. Small. Not one of the main universities. Art History, I assume, though I haven’t asked her about it. She has an interview set up, but nothing is, you know, guaranteed.”,“Nothing’s ever guaranteed, sugar.” He uncrosses his legs and lays his hands, palms down, in his lap.,“But she’ll be fine. I’m not worried.”,“Of course you’re not, she’s so smart, she’ll be fine fine fine. Besides, it’s not like we’re sending her off without a party.”,“Don’t remind me.” This is an empty statement, I was already thinking about the party. I throw tremendous parties, parties that reflect the effort I put into them. I make the guest lists, I call the friends, I deal with the florists, the caterers, everything. I am a beacon of hip culture and my get-togethers define the industry of chic. I am a golden boy and have been famous, in the correct circles, since I was six years old. But I am half of an act. The other half, my complement, my straight man, my heart, is leaving. And now I have to plan her goodbye party alone.,“Do you need help?” Herb asks, and without pausing for an answer he squeals at a passing dog, making baby faces as the beast looks away. ,“No, but thank you. It’s basically all planned and ready. I just picked up my suit. Gucci. Hasn’t even been on the runway.” The dog, half a block down by now, is barking and refusing to move. Herb looks on, talking distractedly while he waggles a finger at the immobile dog.,“Cute. I’m not a Gucci boy myself. I’m sure it’ll look great on you, though.” He turns to me and smiles. “You have those fabulous shoulders.”,And this is funny and queer. I feel like crying. Not tears across the cheek, quiet sobs type of crying. No. I feel like stage crying, tremendous cries of pain to prove to the entire café, nay to the entire block how horrible this is. I want the dog to hear it; I want the dog to break free of its owner, charge frantically to my feet and start howling at the sky. I want Herb to take his sunglasses off, to pull a suede handkerchief from one of his pockets and offer it to me. I want to embarrass him horribly. I want Herb to feel awkward right now, to make up an excuse to leave.,Herb was born into money, as if the doctor had sewn together an impromptu blanket of dollar bills with which to clean the blood and placenta from the mewling infant Herb’s face. His great uncle, while in the belly of a plane in the Great War, had taken careful notes on the metals used in plane construction and had, upon returning (sans one leg) to the states, set up a huge metal importing corporation. This uncle gained a respectful notoriety as a result of some fortunate court cases, and soon became known as THE importer of high quality metals. His vast amount of money roared down the bloodline until it reached Herb, who hopped the globe until he discovered that no city compared to New York. No city, he says with experienced ennui, can even compare.,I take a long drink of coffee. Herb clearly has other thoughts on his mind as he shifts slightly in his tight nylon shirt. ,“It sounds very nice, honey, I can’t wait to see it.” ,“What are you getting her?” I ask. I have bought her no gift. The party is my gift. The party is going to be my last gift, the one she will remember while she promenades on the left bank, missing me.       ,“Earrings, very pretty, very expensive. This fabulous umbrella with this Monet on it. Oh, and this book about Paris by Adam Gopnick. Do you know him?” Herb smiles.,“Sure. He’s on NPR a lot.” ,“Oh NPR, how good of you. How informative.”,“Shut up.” I say, perhaps too quickly. Lunch is officially over, and parties of elderly tourists and theater-goers are sitting for an early dinner. Herb signals to the waiter, smiling wide and addressing him as Garcon.,“Garcon,” he says, “a check, s’il-vous plait.” I throw two twenty dollar bills on the table and put them back in my wallet when Herb frowns and shakes his head. The clouds are tinted in a light maroon, like speckled blood across the sky. I’m still hungry.,“Is Marlo going to be at the party?” Herb asks, pausing as he gets out of his seat.,“Maybe.

All the Lincoln Center people will be there too, with Scott and Tobias and the short one, with the name like the day.”,“Tuesday?” Herb posits.,“Tuesday. I’m sure Tuesday will be there. Stop worrying. You will have a great time.” ,I’m ready to leave. I want to walk to the West Side and run my hand along the buildings and scrape my feet. I want to walk very slowly.,“Of course I will,” he says. “I’m looking forward to it tremendously.” ,There are three men who work for my favorite catering company. Their names are Milosh, Pieter and Egon. They met in Zurich on leave from the Red Army, and tried unsuccessfully to run a brothel. They have told me horrible stories of Zurich prostitutes and the Cabarets that played for a limited audience of Japanese business men. Milosh, whose English was the best, talks while Pieter imitates the characters, pulling back on his eyes for the Japanese men and dancing like a stripper when necessary. Egon just laughs and mutters, “Yes yes, was all very silly.” The primary-colored silliness of Zurich and the failed brothel is evident in their every move, and their dedication to social ease and loud parties is extraordinary. These men, whose thick fingers and thick moustaches and round, wet voices protrude oafishly in front of them, are the only ones whom I trust with tremendous get-togethers. They call themselves the Brothers Buchlotzki.,Tonight, Egon and Milosh are lifting crates of ginger ale from the freight elevator to my apartment door. Pieter stops and places his hand on my shoulder. His red face is beaded with sweat and his breath smells of cars and old, deep wood.,“Is not nice, this time I think. There is something different about…about the room. Is you, I think, is your face.” He smiles weakly. ,“Yes,” I put my hand on his, “it’s a going-away party. Very sad.”,“But no! This party for the leaving can be very fun, indeed. Is best party, sometimes. If you think about…about the person who is leaving very hard for a very long time at this party, then you will not miss her.”,“I am thinking about her all the time.” I grasp his hand very hard. ,“Yes but if you think about this girl for a very long time, by the time party is over, you will be sick of her.” He laughs very hard, so hard that Milosh in the next room barks something in Russian. Pieter continues, “You will want her to leave, you will kick her…kick her out the door without saying goodbye.”,I laugh a little bit as Pieter bends over and picks up two bottles of Grand Marnier. He is still laughing as he walks into the kitchen. Milosh and Egon walk by and Egon winks at me and smiles. I walk into the living room and sit on the couch with my hands on my knees. Eventually Milosh sits down next to me and hands me a drink which is pungent and sour and awfully strong.,“You tell me about this girl. I tell you story about my girl who left afterwards. First you. And where is your sister? I have a present for her, I think she will like.” Milosh motions at the drink and I lift it up and swallow a great deal of it. My head feels large and hot, and then slowly deflates comfortably. ,“She’ll be here. She is out shopping for extra food. I told her not to, but she is anyway. She never listens.” I finish the drink.,“No she never listens. I tell her, Lily, I say, you must not to pour the drinks too high, or your guests will be all throwing up all the day and you’re party will be ruined and I will have to do with the cleaning up. But she never listens and you remember how that ended.” I did. Topher still refers to that party as “Vomitorium Redux.” Lily’s strong beverages had sent many young and beautiful socialites to the toilets and sinks, and those who could not make it simply used the flower pots or the carpets. It was quite funny in retrospect, yet Lily felt awful. The next day she would not come out of her room, despite my pleas and entreaties. I finally put on lipstick and kissed her door, and when she finally came out that night the sight of my lip imprints lifted her spirits.,“You tell me about your girl first. The one who left, then I’ll tell you about mine who is leaving tonight.” I say a bit flirtatiously. I turn into a liquid, a collection of cool thoughts and gestures the minute I get tipsy.,“Oh alright. Is not very funny story, but will maybe lift your spirits. Is nice story, I tell it many times, and every time with the telling it changes. But I remember the real story, and will tell you that one, is rare privilege.”,“I feel blessed, Milosh, really I do.” ,“Well,” said Milosh, “when I was very young man, about seventeen years, I received in the mail a letter of recruitment. To the army. And I was not a brave man back then, was very scared. All the time I was with the trembling and even with the crying. I am not afraid to say it, about the crying, for that is what I did. All night I would ask of God not to go. To take away this letter. And so late one night, about one week after receiving the letter, I ran into the countryside, into the forest by my farm. I ran for many hours, until slowly I could see the sun over my shoulder. By and by, I came across a woman who was very small, no taller than my chest, and very thin. She was beautiful too, with brown hair and great, big eyes and a small amount of fat left under her chin. Was very very beautiful. And she asked of me one question, she said, ‘Hunter, are you going to chop down more trees?’ I knew that she had confused me for a hunter, so I told her who I was and began to walk along, looking for nothing but to escape the Red Army. But this small woman, who was maybe even a child, still held my arm and asked me again about the trees. When I told her that I had no plan to cut down trees, but only to live in the woods where no man could find me, she told me that she was no woman, not even a child, but a creature we call Drepsotske, a spirit of tree. I was very scared. A Drepsotske is very bad luck when she catches your arm, for she will not let you go until you fulfill three of her requests. That is what the old in my village said.”,“That’s a tight spot,” I said, standing and refilling my glass with Campari and soda. I sat back down. “Please go on. The wood lady has got your arm and she’s not letting go. Please continue.”,“Well I thought that I was done for,” Milosh said, leaning back into the couch, “I was running from the army, a little boy running from the army, and here I was caught by a Drepsotske, surely doomed to a life of servitude. But then the creature just sat down, holding my arm and looking still more beautiful, talking to me for days upon days about the trees, the rivers, the sky, everything. And it was very wonderful, to sit and to talk, was all very nice and soft and…less serious than everything else. And so first, when she asked me to clear a field of the debris from an invasion long since forgotten, I did so slowly, so that I might listen to her talk and feel her hand right here on my arm. And when she asked me to nurse a small bird back to feeling better I did it with heavy heart, knowing that soon her time with me would be over. Finally, the Drepsotske asked of me to give her a kiss, which is what I most wanted in the world. But I knew that doing so would cause her to let go of my arm, and she would disappear into the forest from where she had come. So for a long time I did not kiss her, but I thought of nothing else. I wanted so badly to do it, you see, to give her this one kiss, it was all of importance to me. So finally, as the sun rose on my twentieth day in the forest, I lay her down and kissed her very gentle on her lips. And it was wonderful, was most wonderful kiss in the history. You see the movie where Bogart is kissing with Bacall, that was nothing to my kiss with the Drepsotske, was that good. And when was over, she let go of my arm and walked away. I did not try to follow, I knew that to try was to doom myself to a life of following. So that very day I walked to a nearby village and joined the Red Army. There I killed no men, and fired but two bullets. And the whole time, and every minute since, I am thinking about my forest girl. My little one who walked away with me not even following.”,I kick lightly at his foot. He smiles at me with heavy red eyes and stands up with a loud exhalation of breath.,“You know,” I said, smiling, “I would’ve let her get away too. I mean what can you do, if she’s made up her mind. You did your best for her, right? She made up her mind.” I watch him walk into the hall and shrug before taking up three folding chairs and laying them by the door of my apartment.,“And your girl? Is she as beautiful as mine?” He asked, unfolding a chair.,“It’s my sis, Milosh, its Lily. She’s leaving for good. To Paris. It’s her going-away party.”,“Oh. She is even more beautiful. That is very good news for her. I have had many adventures in Paris. We all have, adventures in the river, in boats. Very many stories. But now I must be with the setting up. Is almost time.” He pats my shoulder, and I pat his hand, which is appropriate, given the circumstances. He smiles and is smiling, smiling, smiling while he pours drinks into molds for ice cubes. It seems to take forever.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/going_away/,"

"My grandmother was a pirate. The other was an astronaut. She would have been, anyway, had she not failed her medical exam due to large traces of cocaine in her bloodstream. She was also a drug runner across the border, much to the shame of my father and uncle. She would jump into large trucks headed for Colombia and hitchhike her way back to the United States, her grandmotherly handbags filled to the brim with high grade nose-candy. That’s what my father used to call it when I was little. Grandmother deals with nose-candy, he would say, turning away from me with downcast eyes. ,The pirate is also a Jewess. And my mother says her criminal behavior was most likely a response to the oppression she felt growing up in Poland as a young Jew. She fled to America with her husband, a proctologist with, coincidentally, a fierce cocaine habit. They landed in Brooklyn, but my grandmother, after giving birth to my mother and aunt, fled to New Orleans where she fell in, apparently, with the wrong crowd. Her piracy began with mere con-jobs. A beautiful woman, my dark-complexioned grandmother soon became one of the most prized prostitutes in the Nolia. She befriended Louis Armstrong, or so my mother says, smiling.  It was Louis, legend  has it, who first introduced my pirate grandmother to a scurvy gang of scallywags and their captain, Doctor Bloodshanks. ,Both women were quiet, both subtle and coy, both clever. My pirate grandmother quickly disposed of Doctor Bloodshanks, first luring him to her bed and then cursing him by spelling occult symbols on his back during their lovemaking. He was found the next day with his head caved inwards into his torso. His blood had been almost completely drained, and what was left was brackish and thick as southern molasses. My astronaut grandmother also used her womanly wiles to climb the ranks of NASA. While she never cheated on my grandfather (she did, my uncle always states in his drunken stupor, love him till the day she died), she would knit shawls of the most provocative maroons and sensual oranges. Her tea cozies would melt any man’s heart, and more than a few women found themselves amorously stroking her needlepoint pillows. ,My pirate grandmother became, of course, the scourge of the Caribbean. You might have heard of her, but I will not repeat her name. My mother has been trying to escape from under that shadow for her entire life. Her ship, christened the Adonai, cut through the waves like a plague, laying waste to cruise liners and naval battleships. Survivors, paralyzed in fear, could only describe the black flag with the blood-red Star of David. ,I picture my astronaut grandmother as a little girl, gazing starwards with her grandmother lips pursed tight in anticipation. Her lines and wrinkles (for surely she was born with them) like deep shadow gashes along her moonlit face. She must have been rather pretty.  ,I like to think that my pirate grandmother was provoked by anti-Semitism into her grisly profession. Perhaps this is not so, perhaps she was born into her blood-lust. My astronaut grandmother would have attributed her behavior to the alignment of the stars on her birth night. My astronaut grandmother used to tell me, running her brittle fingers through my hair, that I was born when Orion’s Belt was smiling and the Big Dipper was tipping over. That is why I am smart and beautiful, she used to say. ,Even though my pirate grandmother had abandoned her two daughters, she was surely thinking of them always. She would send large packages to her husband back in Brooklyn. The boxes contained gold doubloons, Argentinean sheep, cow’s heads from Peru, Jamaican marijuana and, once, a small infant from Cabo San Lucas. These my grandfather would sell to supplement his income and, sadly, his destructive addiction to high grade nose-candy. He was a truck driver. While I sympathize with my mother and aunt, it is my grandmother’s booty that is paying for my college education.,My astronaut grandmother never walked on the moon, but she passed along to me her wild imagination. She would tell me stories of over-sexed Martians, Venutian civil wars, and the political disputes between the rings of Saturn. The galaxy will always be filled to the brim with excitement for me, and when I look up I remember her soft voice and soft, soft eyes.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/grandmother/,"

"For Shits and Giggles  ,Forced Entry: Delving into Pasolini’s Salò,By Chris Arp,The President of Italy and his three friends, a Duke, a Magistrate and a Bishop, sit at the head of a table surrounded by teenage SS officers, a few older women, and about twenty young boys and girls. Some of the youths are dressed in suits and dresses, others in their underwear, while still others sit naked. A nude girl emerges from the kitchen with a large tray of steaming shit. The human feces are served, log by log, to those assembled. The President relishes the flavor, swirling it around in his mouth, showing his poop-stained teeth to a little boy in order to encourage him to eat. The children follow suit. While they cry and gag, they know that not eating would result in unspeakable torture, and so they eat, while one girl whispers across the table to her friend: “I can’t go on. I wish I was dead.” Her friend can only cry and swallow.,	After this scene, the President escorts a teenage boy dressed in a wedding gown upstairs to his chambers. The boy’s mouth is smeared with poop, as is the President’s, and when the President kisses the child it marks the most nauseating kiss in the history of cinema. The film is Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Salò, and it is the filthiest movie ever made. By far. ,	Banned for years in many countries, Salò was re-released by The Criterion Collection in a limited run in 1998, and copies now sell on Ebay for upwards of 300 dollars. While bootlegs (like the one you can rent at the Language Resource Center) abound, an authentic copy is considered by many to be the rarest DVD in the world. Pasolini himself was killed (brutally, and by a male prostitute, no less) three weeks after the film was completed, a stroke of fate that many critics saw as justice for making such a film as Salò. Children are raped, have their eyes gouged out, genitalia burnt, scalps pulled off, tongues cut out, and of course, they eat copious amounts of human waste. In the midst of this nightmare vision, the four noblemen dance the can-can and sing jazz tunes. And the film is, in all seriousness, quite excellent.,	Salò is a close adaptation of the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom (which, you should know, was written in the Bastille, stolen during Bastille Day, and only published in an edited form for doctors and lawyers until 1935), set in Fascist Italy in the small town of Salò. The four noblemen round up teenage boys and girls, choose which ones they find attractive, ship them out to their mansion and proceed to mess them up. The structure of the film is heavily based on Dante: broken up into four parts of increasing deprivation, entitled “Anteinferno,” “Circle of Obsessions,” “Circle of Shit,” and finally the “Circle of Blood.” Needless to say, by the “Circle of Blood” I had to watch the screen from inside my couch-fort while I stroked my blue buddy blanket that I’ve had since infancy.,	“In addition to being anarchic what best characterizes power – any power – is it’s natural capacity to turn human bodies into objects,” Pasolini writes, “Nazi-Fascist oppression excelled in this.” The film is certainly a withering attack on Fascism, but I have a feeling that the political bent of the film has faded and will continue to obscure until the film reveals itself to be an earnest meditation on the underlying nature of perversity and morality in a perverse and immoral world.  ,	Maybe.,	Or maybe not.  Perhaps the movie is a celebration of the extreme rationality and lustful debauchery of the Marquis de Sade, wherein only the most heinous is allowed. The cinematography is certainly gorgeous, as Pasolini steadies his camera as if each room were its own stage, and the walls and floors of the splendid villa shimmer and shine as if buffed by the tongues of pre-teen boys. The costumes and mannerisms of the aristocrats adhere to the “‘veiled’ reconstruction of Nazi ceremonial ways,” as Pasolini outlines, and the acting (most of the stars are amateurs) is at times remarkable. Aldo Valletti, as the cross-eyed President, smiles like the Cheshire Cat as he holds a candle to a girl’s nipple, and his squeals of pleasure are some of the most profoundly disturbing I have ever heard. But what does it all mean? There is much philosophical musing between the gory bits, to be sure, but the ultimate message of the film is to be debated.,	What really makes such grotesquery worth the trouble is the general ambiance Pasolini establishes from the first scene and manages to maintain throughout. The Villa in Salo rests apart from the natural world, in a void independent of human history and standard emotion. Here children are not children as we would think of them, rather they are lesser citizens who have not earned the right to complain when we murder them. Women are performers, libertinage is the only virtue, and pleasure can only be maintained when it is accentuated by grievous brutality. The mansion is truly a nightmare, and in this light the film assumes a distinct and beautiful totality. In a dream, the worst dregs of the imagination, indeed images we would not have thought ourselves capable of creating, exist side by side with the vagaries and absurdities of standard dream-stuff. When they come to dominate the dream, to influence the tone completely, the dream becomes a nightmare, with its own nightmare logic. This is exactly the world of Salò. When glimmers of humanity enter (one of the guards falls in love with a black maid, two of the girl-slaves fall in love with each other, and one of the aristocrats seems to feel genuine affection for one of the boys), they become the freakish oddities. Pain is the norm, and when the boys seem to enjoy the forced sodomy, it is so much more disturbing because it feels contrary to the system of rules established at the beginning of the film. To watch Salò is to immerse yourself completely in a skewed and disordered universe, where emotions and morals have rearranged themselves in new combinations. The most horrifying moments are those of recognition, when the dream vision becomes momentarily familiar.    ,	So walk yourself over to the Language Resource Center and pick up Salò. And don’t feel ashamed if you get a little aroused when they force-feed nails to a collared slave-girl, it happens to all of us. ,The End of Rock and Roll,No More Solace for America’s White Underbelly,By Jacob O. Gold,There is a neighborhood on the outskirts of a city with a lousy bar and grimy brick buildings and orange lamps in the alleys. There are towns where in the deep hours of night cars prowl the streets full of dumb menace. Vague criminals and edgy losers grope at women dressed in cheap finery and the sex is drunken and ugly and brief. Degenerate districts of the underclass brood with a special life, a marginal life championed for a time but championed no more. ,From the late seventies through the late eighties, music celebrated the illicit pleasures, gritty struggles, and seedy badass fatalism of The White Man on the skids; it was the driving theme of the hard rock music which once shook the workaday masses all night long.  ,For some holdouts pulsing amid the musical mutations of the following decades, this was the last phase in a history of an un-self-conscious rock music, wherein the lyrical voice of an Alpha persona reckons with love, lust, debauched good times, and the rougher side of the social order.  This sense of uncompromised power washes over the listener for the few minutes that one of these songs may last. ,Later developments in rock lack this great stoic ignorance. In self-conscious Late Rock, the wrong side of the tracks, the wrong side of the heart, the right time to do wrong things, is no longer be a Valhalla of dudehood. Hard rock was an undanceable music for people who never entertained the notion that dancing had anything to do with being a cool jerk having a sweet time, who were righteously content with the pumping of fists and goofy joggling of the body while the beers kept coming and butter-faces remotely reminiscent of Tara Reid (who had only just been born) stumbled around acting stupid. ,The reproduction of these scenes in our present times is best complemented by this type of music, which has ceased being produced. The fact that Dave Matthews Band or even Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” may be heard playing at a frat party at, say, the University of Illinois, is merely a matter of bad taste exercised by young men whose un-monstrousness, given the context, is more than a little embarrassing. ,The implication of the disappearance of Alpha Rock music is that a certain type of musically-constructed American person, one that is a composite between lives both real and imagined, has lost its voice and consequently the ability of that voice to say something to those who might identify with it. In a sense, the disappearance of this type of music has actually resulted in the public denial of a certain experience of life, the life which had brewed this music in the first place.  ,This rock rightly recalls the Greek epic and Norse saga; the relationship between the lyric and the listener is that of an all-too-mortal man coming to grips with his own possibilities through the exemplary being and action of a godlike hero. Like Beowulf himself, hard rock’s demigods are not strung from some fiber other than that of every other Trans Am-driving shitbag in the mead-hall, but are rather the perfection of that fiber and the embodiment of its ideals. In their own sleazy way, hard rock songs attempt to address the joy of celebration, the pain of love, and the struggle of everyday life with a nobility of spirit tooled for the postindustrial age in all its dirty glory. ,	This retooling replaces a nobility of the spirit with an infamy of the spirit, the hero with anti-hero. What remains is the exaltation, hard rock’s huge electrified noise effacing the pretensions of the tragic to reveal those epic heroes for what they were: slaughterers who get us high. This music effects one of the ultimate statements of the modern era- that the Pathetic has replaced the Tragic as the driving paradox of artistic creation. And so, in the Guns N Roses song “Nightrain,” Axl Rose gives banshee voice to a venomously arrogant pretender-outlaw who describes himself in the following verse:,Well I’m a west coast struttin’,One bad mother,Got a rattlesnake suitcase,Under my arm,Said I’m a mean machine,Been drinkin’ gasoline,An honey you can make my motor hum,I got one chance left,In a nine live cat,I got a dog eat dog sly smile,I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go,I smoke my cigarette with style,An I can tell you honey,You can make my money tonight,For this denizen of some world intimately tied up in The Bus Station, it is important to get across to us relatively quickly the fact that he carries a rattlesnake suitcase.  Upon inspection, none of the phrases employed turn out to mean anything concrete but are instead, like the rattlesnake suitcase, strung together in order to strike a pose, to sculpt a grifter idol whose shrine is the cassette deck. This stasis is reinforced by the conclusion of chorus: “I’m on the nightrain/Ready to crash and burn.” (ital. added) This crash never happens, allowing the song to forever encourage the manner of mimetic worship and contemplation this frozen fetish requires: getting trashed. ,AC/DC’s “Shoot to Thrill” operates from a similarly static platform. The pith of chorus, “Shoot to Thrill/Play to Kill/ Too many women/Too many pills” divides the violently active phrase “Shoot to Kill” into two puns of felt (less-than-active) pleasure- thrill and playfulness, and the paralleled phrases following this, in their double “too,” suggest that the singer experiences a paralysis in his degree of sex and drug consumption. ,“Shooting” can also be read as a reference to heroin and the catatonic thrill it affords, and “playing” to (and here is the one action conceded by the fact that this song exists) the performance of rock music, though killing is not meant literally. All of this generates the image of a rocker whose ‘doing’ is deferred so that the listener revels along with the singer in the ‘being’ of the rock star, the raw (self-)destructive privilege of his status. ,Some of the hard rock of white marginality indulges more of this life-pathos. Van Halen’s “Running With the Devil” goes:,I live my life like there’s no tommorow,All I’ve got i had to steal,At least I don’t have to beg or borrow,Yes I’m living at a pace that kills,ohh,(runnin with the devil),ahhh yeah,(runnin with the devil),And Whitesnake’s “Here I Go Again”:,An’ here I go again on my own,Goin’ down the only road I’ve ever known,,Like a hobo* [this word was changed to ‘drifter’ in 1987] I was born to walk alone,An’ I’ve made up my mind,I ain’t wasting no more time,I’m just another heart in need of rescue,,Waiting on love’s sweet charity,An’ I’m gonna hold on,For the rest of my days,,’cos I know what it means,To walk along the lonely street of dreams…,Like their hard-scrap American forebears, the westward loners, these are the haunted and forlorn losers of their time and place. Somehow, they are damned. And yet there is no frontier for them, no escape from night highways through the sprawling low-budget neon necropolis, the uncaring arms of strangers in dark motels. Trapped as they are in a country where the poor are getting poorer, it is no wonder their rock music embraces stagnation, the proud and wretched bacchanals of those with little to lose. ,The deafening roar of this music is a testament to what it is meant to overcome, what senses it is meant to obliterate and replace with wicked glory. The poetry of the Rough Drifter has for well over a century served as solace, albeit at times politically questionable solace, for whole swathes of people who desperately yearn to break free, even if it gets ugly.  The current neglect of this therapeutic tradition bodes ill for these dishonest times.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/nasty_culture/,"

"Last week a movie called Date Movie, presumably because it concerns dating or perhaps one particular date, was released nationwide. It is the brainchild of the same team of writers behind Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2. This is also the same team that wrote Scary Movie 3. And now they have written another movie. They call it Date Movie. I have not seen the movie, nor will I ever. I swear on the lives of all orphans across the globe that I will never see this film. Not if a gun is held to my head, not if you slowly slit my torso with paper cuts will I even watch the trailer. This is because Date Movie is, without a doubt in my mind, the worst movie I will never see.,Now I should elaborate before continuing with this pre-emptive review. There are so many movies that I will never see. I will never see Ed Wood’s classic The Revenge of Dr. X (aka The Devil’s Garden, The Double Garden, and The Venus Flytrap), nor will I see Hobgoblins, It’s Pat, Murdercycle, Ricki-Oh: The Story of Ricki or Cop and ½. Well, I have seen Cop and ½, but only because I will see any movie starring Norman D. Golden II. Needless to say, there are some truly gut-wrenching films out there that I will never see. Take into account the whole globe. There must be some teenagers in the Philippines with a video camera making some of the most god-awful movies you can imagine, and I am including these in my list of movies I will never see. I am including every mind-numbing marriage video, stomach-turning birth movie and mostly-awkward amateur porno in the list as well. Everything that has ever been committed to film or video. Date Movie is the worst. I would imagine. ,Against my will, I have heard through the grapevine that the film is a spoof of romantic comedies. If the “jokes” of the Scary Movie oeuvre are any indication, most of the laughs of Date Movie will come from referencing such films as The Wedding Planner, Meet the Fockers, Hitch and When Harry Met Sally. These haughty comedies, what with their coherent plots and vomit-free gags, are just begging for some rich parody. ,I hope that they take these comedies, and bam it up a notch by inserting a prosthetic ass and having a white girl speak like a black girl. At which point I will kill myself. Or I won’t, because I’m not going to see it. Ever. If space-time, due to the collapse of some nearby planet, stretches in such a way that I am shifted into a theater playing Date Movie, I will pull out my eyes and stuff them in my ears before the opening credits role.,What I love about these films is how parody has become reference. Mention a film during a scene, and the audience is guaranteed to respond. “I’ve seen that movie,” we cry out amidst peals of laughter, “and now I’m seeing it again!” Then, according to the formula, we are given a short dose of plot, and then we are cracking up again, screaming through our tears: “White girls don’t usually talk like that!”,I hate this fucking movie. ,If you are going to see one movie this year, and you are in the mood for some innocent gags and maybe a laugh or two, save yourself some money and just rent Munich.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/date_movie/,"

"Every respectable ideology needs an encyclopedia. The editors of the Enlightenment Encyclopédie, when composing the organizational frontispiece to the work, situated religion but a few spokes away from superstitions and black magic, while the reader of the entry on “Cannibalism” interested in related themes would find himself advised to consult the “Eucharist” entry, were he to consult the book’s reference notes. The good Bolshevik editors of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, for example, were quick to minimize the entry on “Jews” in the face of the Soviet anti-Semitism of the early 1950s. And while the neatly-edited pages of larger Wikipedia articles may give the impression of a smoothed-over ideological consensus, any look into the discussion pages of more contentious articles suggests that the tradition of encyclopedia as ideology is not want to end. As one user, “Truthteller,” wrote of Wikipedia’s “Creationism” article: “I hate to tell you this but you obviously have your facts wrong. This is so biased that it quite obviously tells me that you either HATE Christians, or Jesus Christ, Himself, or that you have NEVER taken ANY time to check out the facts for yourself.” If New York attorney Andrew Schlafly has his way, future encyclopedia readers may take with them an even harsher judgment of Wikipedia than “Truthteller.” Schlafly is the mind behind Conservapedia.com, an alternative online encyclopedia that describes itself as “a much-needed alternative to Wikipedia, which is increasingly anti-Christian and anti-American.” Schlafly devoted much of his free time to home-schooling high school age children in New Jersey until he found that many of his pupils, who came from conservative Christian households, had to rely on Wikipedia – “full of dangerous ideas that homeschooling was supposed to prevent from seeping into the home,” one pro-Schlafly blog says – for much of their research. The war against Wikipedia was on!  In the most-read article on Conservapedia, “Examples of Bias in Wikipedia,” Schlafly writes that “the entry for the Renaissance in Wikipedia refuses to give enough credit to Christianity” and that its “Abortion” entry “reads like a brochure for the abortion industry.”  It would be easy – and perhaps unfair – for the anti-American, anti-Christian-fundamentalist writer to document and satirize the historical claims that Conservapedia makes. Indeed, while a rudimentary visit to and search of the site will yield plenty of yuks for the liberal Internet user, what is most striking about Conservapedia may not be its content but the way it has changed the encyclopedia itself. Rather than structuring the encyclopedia as a collection of human knowledge, Conservapedia is structured in such a way that encyclopedic knowledge is only useful insofar as it aids its reader to develop a Christian dialectic in which, as Arthur Koestler says, “New facts automatically take on the proper color and fall into the proper place.” If it is true that most encyclopedias tell their readers what was thought, then the brilliance of Conservapedia is that, more than just summarizing the past, it provides its readers with the ideological framework necessary to process and defend themselves from new and challenging facts. Conservapedia is only superficially similar to Wikipedia. A visit to the homepage yields a few basic similar options – a welcome note, a news section, and an “On This Day in History” column – yet something seems different. For one, the collective professionalism of Wikipedia is missing: Conservapedia lacks a logo, and while a discussion page shows that the site’s contributors are working on one, the desire to differentiate their logo from that of Wikipedia’s has led to creative slowdowns. At this juncture, the Conservapedia muse has graced the organization with the following suggested logo:	    Conservapedia is short on articles: while it can boast since its founding in November 2006 to have surpassed the Kyrgyz and Turkmen versions of Wikipedia in terms of total articles, with 3,800 articles, it remains several thousand entries behind such languages as Afrikaans, Basque, and Esperanto. And the miniscule length of many Conservapedia articles is problematic, and one discussion page even poses the question, “Should Conservapedia be taken offline, or locked against editing, on Sundays?”  But though this may seem madness, there is method in it. More than having decided that “we’re not always consistent about everything” with respect to the Sabbath, the consistency and quality of Conservapedia’s articles reflects the fact that articles are composed in an entirely different way here than at other online encyclopedias. The process of writing Conservapedia goes through several stages: Schlafly begins by writing a “lecture” on a given subject, and the website currently features a complete fourteen-lecture world history course from Creation to today. But the original lectures themselves feature little original source material and are the product of a dilettante’s hand; writing of the decision of many Europeans to make the journey to the New World, Schlafly draws the parallel: “Think about it. Would your family uproot and move, at great risk to your lives, to a place that had no civilization or anything of value? Do we see families moving to the middle of the desert in Arizona, or to cheap land in the middle of Wyoming? No.” At any rate, the child’s education stops at the point where the lectures end – at least until they write articles for terms used in the most recent lecture. Once enough students have filled in or improved terms from the most recent lecture, Schlafly writes and posts the next unit’s lecture; then the students are to research and create entries on that newer lecture’s key figures and concepts, repeating the cycle anew.   Conservapedia is, then, on the one hand an encyclopedia by and for children. Whether for limited understanding or in a precocious attempt to circumvent the guidelines of homework, most articles are about a paragraph in length and consist largely of quotations copied and pasted from other sources.   But what is the content? Looking to Schlafly’s complete world history course with its fourteen lectures, what jumps out is how thoroughly most historical events are integrated into a relentless attack on atheism, science, and in some sense, liberalism. While discussions of history prior to 1859 feature their gems, world history since the publication of Origin of Species is one long nightmare. Inquiring as to the roots of imperialism, we learn that “in England and Germany, people who believed in Darwin’s theory of evolution felt a racial superiority and sought conquest (survival-of-the-fittest) to force other races into submission.” This, of course, led to the Nazi Holocaust: “Besides 6 million Jews dying, 3 million Christians were killed also along with many priests and nuns. This is a very touchy subject for the Jews and is not often discussed amongst them.”  And as for the father of it all? We read that “Darwin’s own family considered him to be a disgrace even before he failed at an attempt to become a doctor.” People who subscribe to evolutionary theory are viewed on Conservapedia as superficially educated in science.  The brilliance, however, of Schlafly’s project is the degree to which Conservapedia provides readers with the proper ideological framework through which to discuss any and all topics. The Conservapedian physicist, looking for information on Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, reads that “relativity has generated a huge following by advocates of moral relativism. The idea of moral relativity may exist independent of (and substantially predates) the theory of relativity, but invocations of the theory are used in attempts to lend legitimacy to this version of morality.” Betrand Russell, for example, is defined not as a philosopher or logician, but “a twentieth-century atheist.” In short, Conservapedian articles are written in such a way that opposition to atheism and evolution becomes the measuring stick for historical importance. Conservapedia presents its reader with information in such a way that all historical events, persons, and concepts, can be assimilated and understood through an anti-atheist worldview. If Freud was hated by the Soviets for his anti-proletarian bourgeois science and by the Nazis for his race, then the Conservapedian would hate him for his atheism. It remains to be seen – or rather read in the pages of future encyclopedias – how successful the Conservapedian experiment will become. Yet, if one reflects more on how the online encyclopedia may reflect and alter human perception, it seems prudent to remember that the Wikipedian project may be disliked not just by the academy for the way it threatens to destroy the craft of research, but also by the American Christian Right, for while the democratic, collective-editing craft of Wikipedia may reflect modern liberals’ stance towards how citizens ought to argue about and settle factual disputes, revelation does not and will not fit into the Wikipedia article paradigm.   “History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it,” Churchill said, but the days of his post-war statement may have come to an end. For if some take away Conservapedia’s colorful articles and pedagogy-driven structure from these contemplations, Schlafly’s project seems most remarkable in how it contests a view of historiography and encyclopedia-writing based on consent, evidence, and debate. Whether my post-mortem days find me immortalized in self-indulgent histories of my period or just tucked into a passing footnote with other epigones of my day, will my legacy depend more on the homework of an errant home-schooled eighth-grader than the actions of my life?

"One of my primary introductions to the Arts, and more specifically the Performing Arts, was through the little-known genre of Modern Dance called “Site-Specific Dance-Poetry Fusion.” I have been taken with this unique blend of spoken and written words and dance since I was a child, and have done much reading about it, including the seminal works Poetry, and also Dance by Klaus Fuchten and Movement through Word in a Particular Place by the legendary Mary Timrock. Consequently, I approached Silas Riener’s senior thesis show “Fugue State: The Idea, a Site-Specific Senior Thesis in Dance and Poetry” with much technical and critical expertise.,Oh god, I’m lying! I don’t know anything about Site-Specific Dance-Poetry Fusion. And those books, I made them up! But Silas’s show was damn good, and I will do my best to tell you why.,I’ve always loved dance as a celebration of the present. More so even than the theater, dance is solely relevant to and expressive of the moment at which it occurs. The specific tension of the performer’s muscle, his expression of the face, the relation of foot to ankle and even, by extension, the contraction of the aorta and the flow of blood throughout the body, all come together in glorious testament to existing here and now. Dance feels, for this reason, to be a primal, or at least primary, mode of expression, and it incorporates the gaze of the audience as if it were a partner in the performance. Including space, then, removing the performance from the constrictions of the stage and embracing the specific architecture of the surrounding, only heightens this sense of testament and the urgency of participation on the part of the audience. ,Silas’s work is very much about inspiration, about the vicissitudes of emotion, of dependence, of logic and labor and love that make the substance of thinking, of having an idea. The dancers in these pieces, spinning and collapsing and prostrating themselves in the Chancellor Green Library, enter and exit each other’s orbit, gather each other’s momentum and spin, at times seemingly out of control, into unique expressions of energy. Motifs of movement establish themselves, pulsate briefly and brilliantly and then fade back, leaving only their shadows in the new movements that arise. In the first dance, words and verses from a poem are written across the dancer’s costumes, and the effect is quite breathtaking. As they dance, the audience – most of us high above them – tries to read the words, and in so doing pay close attention to the specific movements of each part of the dancer’s body. I myself found the splendid word “peppermilk,” written on a dancer’s hip, and watched it spin and turn and fall and rise, saw it press against the words “stony necks,” written across another dancer’s back and interact with the hundred other words written across the dancers. At certain splendid moments the dancers would crane their necks and arch their backs to read each other, as pieces of text trying to comprehend itself in order to find a greater unity, to rest in peace with each other. Ripples would pass through the dancers, attempts to organize the mass of words, and for a moment they would almost reach a pose of stasis before breaking apart and spinning away. ,Some of the words are better than others, which feels appropriate. For every “peppermilk” there is also a “high-class hooker,” and the disparity of phrase seems appropriate to a poem that features “crumbling” and “elbows.” The artistic process is nothing if not an awkward one, and it is the vision of beauty within the awkward strivings of the artist that makes Silas’s piece so captivating. ,Also captivating, it should be noted are the dancers themselves. Every performance was breathtaking, but Kristen Arnold and Silas simply blew my mind. During their duet, they evoked the painful awareness of dependence in love so earnestly that at times it was almost difficult to watch. When they rotate back to back, with their heads on each others shoulders, and she leans forward and bears him, prostrate on her back in the dead center of the Library, I was thankful that this particular movement had occurred in this particular location at some point in the history of existence. And I think that is what site-specific dance/poetry is all about.,At one point in the middle of the show Silas reads the poem that we have seen written across the dancers. The presentation of the words being spoken, after witnessing its genesis in dance, illustrates powerfully the impotence of printed words in signifying the tumult of inspiration. To truly understand the chaos of expression one needs an art form that glorifies the present. Silas’s piece does just this, and his poem ends appropriately with the line: “Now, you are here.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_rest_is_silas/,"

"Often times, during my perambulations about campus, I am accosted and questioned about various topics ranging from neuroscience to Neo-Platonism. I have never begrudged a fellow academe his curiosity, and so I am not surprised that I have accrued a modest reputation for my cross-disciplinary erudition and literary acumen. And so, for this most sensual issue of the Nassau Weekly, I was obviously chosen by the editors to write a brief history of masturbation. I cannot say that I have ever engaged in the practice myself, as a weakened liver has forbade me from participating in all sports, cooperative or otherwise. I have read my fair share of histories, however, from Josephus to Ptolemy, and I have more than a trifling acquaintance with the back-story of this our most Godless habit. And so, without further preface, a brief history of self-love:,As with any ancient practice, it is nigh impossible to state the origin of masturbation with any certainty. That being said, masturbatory scholars (hereafter referred to by their professional title: philosophers) tend to divide themselves into two camps, each claiming a different historical origin as unquestionably accurate. By far the most widely-held view is what we insiders commonly call the “Pharaoh’s Phunny Phallus” theorem. The reader will have to forgive the scholarly community its penchant for punnery. ,This theory claims that Pharaoh Aminhotep III was the first human (the debate as to whether Pharaohs are human or divine I will address in a forthcoming article) to ever achieve orgasm through the use of his own hand. An ancient mural depicting the Pharaoh clutching his genitals, unearthed in Cairo in the mid-19th century, was for years interpreted as an instructional tablet illustrating proper table manners, the phallus understood as a saltshaker. This misunderstanding was corrected when a young Egyptian boy, looking at the mural in a museum, said (and I translate from the original Egyptian): “That’s a funny penis.” Archaeologists and Egyptologists were quickly summoned, and a month-long summit concluded in the official statement, pronounced on October 13th, 1867: “After much frank analysis and open debate, we the members of the 112th archaeological summit have found that the saltshaker is, in point of fact, a phallus.” There is some debate amongst followers of the PPP theory even to this day, however, as there is no definitive information as to whether the Pharaoh stroked himself of his own accord, or whether he had a team of slaves moving his hand up and down for him. Slaves were, we must remember, in great abundance in ancient Egypt.,The second, more recently developed theory is the one to which I ascribe. In our third oldest surviving copy of the Babylonian Talmud, there is a portion of Gemarah that is quite striking. The Babylonian Talmud dates back to the 6th century, and the Mishnah contained within could date back to the very beginnings of the Diaspora. In one section of Gemarah, two Rabbis (whose names have long been lost to the sands of time) engage in debate over the rights of men to divorce infertile women. One rabbi (and I translate from the original Hebrew) writes: “In concerning the afflicted woman’s rights, there is no doubt that a diminished status of humanity should be afforded her.” The other rabbi retorts: “You masturbate profusely.” To which the first rabbi responds, in a Talmudic quote that has been the subject of much attention in Yeshivas since time immemorial: “All Jews masturbate all the time. Always.” This clear statement represents to me the oldest verifiable evidence of masturbation performed frequently within a particular historical community. I thusly attribute the birth of self-strokery to the Jews of old.      ,In subsequent installations of this series of articles, I will discuss the major historical ejaculations from the grandiose “Great Spurting of Genghis Kahn” to the subtle “Stroke of Napoleon Across the Collective Russian Ego;” we will see how a shift in hand-style sparked a debate which would eventually lead to the Protestant Reformation; the impact of quantum mechanics on the morality of masturbation will be fully analyzed, and later in the year I will engage in a discussion of that most perplexing work of the late 18th century, Kant’s Critique of Practical Emission. I hope to settle, once and for all, the parameters of influence that this grotesquely beautiful act has exerted upon the development of human civilization.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/selflove/,"

"I am not with the times when it comes to television. Schadenfreude TV upsets me; I can’t watch it. You know what I’m talking about: the semi-scripted reality shows, the “true life” documentaries, the TV that makes you want to die. I know you remember the episode of I Love New York when the woman asks the guy if he’s dressed in pink and green on the assumption she likes watermelon. I don’t get it—sure I enjoy elitism, but I still just can’t bring myself to like these gleeful chronicles of the sheer staggering fucktardedness of people.,But I do love the “Sarah Silverman School” of comedians that you find while channel surfing late at night: Colbert, Cohen, Chapelle—the ones that hurt so good. And the fact that Carlos Mencia tries to be one of them pains me. He is a disgrace to himself and to the profession; to the extent that he discredits his superiors by association, he is unforgivable.    The genius of the comedians of this School lies in their ability to skate on such perilously thin ice. Doesn’t Dave Chapelle seem to live in some “one skit away from being canceled” purgatory? Their humor doles out pain and pleasure in equal measure; it cuts to the heart of issues with dazzling precision. Silverman’s routine about her grandmother’s choosing a customized vanity number for her Auschwitz tattoo—my favorite moment in comedy—takes surgical skill to execute. Carlos Mencia has no skill. No creativity. No subtlety. He is a blatherer. His only assets are the cretinous bellow of a palsied Bessarabian village idiot, and enough of a mestizo appearance to pass off his slurs as self-effacing. And he’s deluded (or stupid) enough to have constructed a theory of comedy as the marriage of cruelty and noise.  What Mencia misses—indeed, what so many would-be provocateurs before him also have missed—is that it does not suffice merely to push the envelope. It is not enough for Silverman to say “Auschwitz,” or for Chapelle to say “slavery.” But Mencia thinks he can yell “beaners” at the top of his lungs and call it an act. Ultimately, it’s not so much the racism and brutality of the humor that damn him, as the artlessness. The man is plainly unfunny.   Silverman calls herself a humble genius and her character an arrogant idiot. And there’s something to that idea. The comedians of the Silverman School are thinkers; on stage, they present the ironic personae they have conceived. Their work sits squarely in the tradition of the “wise fool,” who uses humor and a ridiculous façade to speak the truth. Wise, self-conscious irony will always trump blustering vacuity. Think Feste and Malvolio. And so too Steven Colbert and Bill O’Reilly, Sasha Baron Cohen and Lou Dobbs. There’s a reason college students love these comedians: the outrageousness is bolstered by such intelligence. It did not surprise me in the least to learn that Cohen read history at Cambridge, or that Chapelle’s father taught at Antioch. In the comedy of the Silverman School, ugly naked men wrestling is never just ugly naked men wrestling.  Mencia creates no persona—he is that arrogant idiot. And he doesn’t realize it. His shows are tedious indulgences of instinct: base, aimless, and vitriolic. His brand of humor comes off the trash heap of revolting—and worse, hackneyed—nativism and xenophobia. Each of his jokes is a cheap shot. Yes, political correctness has its excesses… but he is not the cure. He is not the breath of fresh air he thinks he is. He is so crass, so arrogant, so lacking of self-awareness that I can’t watch him onstage; I get too embarrassed for his sake.  	And then there’s the laundry-list of foibles: the pandering name change, the Honduran—not Mexican—origins, the struggles with plagiarism. But no matter. I’m just here to ask, as sweetly as I know how, that Carlos Mencia please make a swift and silent retirement from comedy. That is all.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/mencia_isnt_magic/,"

"Ron Jeremy should be worried. High definition TV could mean the death of porn. Although this may not be so pressing for Ron (I mean, there’s little that can be done to make anything other than this balding, 53-year-old man’s schlong look good), the advent of HDTV could mean some serious changes for the men and women who groan and moan their way in this $10 billion American industry. ,	Ever since Wicked Pictures released the first HD-DVD porn at a Vegas trade show in January, sex scenes–kinky, passionate, and otherwise–have been looking a lot more…well…real. After all, this is the point of watching anything in high definition – the raw, in-your-face quality of a resolution six times that of normal television images. ,What’s good for the goose, however, isn’t necessarily good for the gander. Maybe the sweat and grime of that favorite football game in HD is just what the average American man needs. Maybe sports should be  more real. But maybe porn shouldn’t be so true to life. An industry that doesn’t leave much to the imagination might be about to reveal a lot more than anyone cares to see.,	Who will want to watch porn when it ceases to serve our need for escapism? When it comes down to it, porn is essentially the stylized and idealized version of the sex act that can offer us some sort of reprieve from the monotony of our own bedroom activities. It is a relief from those moments when, caught in the missionary position for the umpteenth time, we look at our partner and see a drop of sweat on her brow, uneven breasts, a smallish penis, or that piece of spinach from dinner between his teeth. While our sex may not be perfect and may not satisfy the fetishistic needs that we are too embarrassed to describe, even to our long-time partners, we have the consolation of taking a voyeuristic journey into the perfectly molded sex adventures of the actors in Tokyo Cream Puffs 2.,	Actors in the industry have long been credited with perfect bodies, sculpted by hours at the gym, toned with fake tanning spray, taut with the help of plastic surgery. But suddenly, the megapixels of high definition have been ruining that untarnished physical image. The proximity and in-the-bedroom feel of high definition has revealed the unsightly human flaws of those actors we had previously thought of as pure sexual beings. For the first time, we understand that these women were not born with the skin of a baby’s bottom. Porn actresses complain most about the fact that high definition brings out the bumps of razor burn. Men have had to turn to professional makeup artists to cover up their wrinkles and blemishes. Women are looking even more orange than usual, as they lather extra layers of sunless tanner on to hide the frightening specter of cellulite. As reported by The New York Times, one actress scheduled a second session under the knife, because after seeing herself in high definition, she realized that her implants from the early 2000s were just not as perky as they had been.,	Despite the trauma that this physical scrutiny has caused, the pornographic crisis is more than skin deep. Adult film directors and cinematographers, many of them men, have been filming in high definition for two years. Industry insiders told The Times that they created an extensive catalogue of HD films, anticipating the popularity of the new system and hoping to find themselves on the crest of this technological wave. Responding to the panic of their starlets, producers have been far from sympathetic, often suggesting stringent diets and more time at the gym. While men have been able to fix their problems with makeup, female porn stars are turning to surgery. It is only after other options have been exhausted that women have successfully influenced directors to consider different positions or film angles. In an art born of the close-up, however, the options for avoiding the harsh truth are limited at best. In short, it seems like the feminine sector of the adult film industry has really been taking it up the ass from HD.,	It’s hard to conceive of the entire porn industry shutting down because of more pressure to “look good.” People have been jumping through hoops for years to get into this lucrative business. Whether it involves extensive waxing (which is RARELY worth it) or avoiding the AIDS epidemic in the San Fernando Valley adult film community, porn is not an easy job. The concerns abound: this could, eventually, turn into a problem of input costs—surgery and constant re-shooting are expensive, as are the rather exhaustive re-touching processes undergone to make the not-so-good look better. Imagine a world when the workingman can’t afford to add That Azz Iz off Da Chain (Combat Zone) to his personal collection. Alternatively, we could see quicker turn-around for porn actors and actresses. This is especially distressing, as there is nothing more comforting than the familiarity of a porn star formed by years of faithful viewership. This loyalty should transcend the aging process. HDTV could sound the death knell for the multi-generational porn king. Imagine…never another Ron Jeremy!,	Yes, this survey of the future of porn is a little bleak. But let us try to end on a hopeful note. So far, adult film studios have run in to a lot of trouble with both HD-DVD makers and Sony’s new Blu-Ray Disc product. Sony has actually gone so far as to make public announcements that it will not mass-produce adult films with this new product. It seems as if the ladies and gents of the American porn industry can take a mid-coitus gasp for air and postpone those appointments for face lifts, liposuction, and breast implants. And we can take a deep breath, too. Porn might stay just the way we like it…a little fuzzy around the edges.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/high_definition/,"

"Humbert Humbert is far from a straightforward man, but he did have the decency to commit a straightforward crime. Lolita was a tender young twelve, her suitor perhaps three times that; whatever physical, metaphysical, sexual, magic or aesthetic power she may have wielded over H.H., she was a child and he was a man of immoral actions. ,Pedophilia, however, has gotten considerably more sophisticated. ,Now-ubiquitous camera phones allow anyone walking through a YMCA locker room to capture images of naked children. Digital video cameras enable bored and horny teenagers to tape themselves having sex; email frees these videos from their computers; YouTube and MySpace give them a limitless arena for distribution. And a sixteen-year-old can be charged with possession of child pornography—if her laptop has naked pictures of herself.  ,Teenage, even pre-teenage, sex is nothing new, nor is our fascination with it. Ten years ago, as today, young girls wore makeup and miniskirts to school and let their gawky boyfriends grope them behind the dumpsters. Kids of both sexes exchange gossip, develop reputations, sleep around. Though their parents may cringe, they often feel safe about such early sexual experimentation—a twelve-year-old’s world, after all, tends to be quite limited. But while such behavior is not a recent phenomenon, the remote access to it is. Whereas an attention-seeking seventh grader was once limited to flaunting her pubescent body at middle school mixers, she can now, with only her parents’ camera, expose herself to a much wider—and much more dangerous—audience. She theoretically has access to an unlimited number of predatory eyes. ,And in doing so, she sets herself up for abuse, exploitation, even prosecution. Several teenage girls have been accused of the sexual victimization of children—namely, themselves—for posting their own nude or exceptionally provocative pictures online. No party profited from these pictures, and none was posted without consent; indeed, in each case, the girl had taken the pictures of herself, for her own website, presumably trying to impress her friends on MySpace. The court ruled, however, that each was guilty of both the dissemination of illicit material and an act of child abuse. They had, essentially, committed a wrong against themselves.,Perhaps harder to justify is last week’s Florida court ruling that two teens who taped themselves having sex were guilty of producing child pornography. She was sixteen, he seventeen; under state law, their sexual relationship was entirely permissible. The video existed only on their own computers and nowhere in hard copy or on the Internet. The court declared, however, that their relationship, neither “mature nor legally committed,” could not be considered a “private arena” in which to possess material that could so easily be spread. The video, it seemed, was at risk for third-party viewing. The inherent volatility of adolescent social structures rendered simple possession of such a film indicative of an intent to distribute. And so the kids were arrested, brought up on child porn charges, and convicted. The term coined was “self-pornography.” ,But to what extent can one victimize oneself? Though legally minors, these teens were fully aware of their actions and the accessibility of the images. No coercion was demonstrated, no form of malicious intent. Their crime seems to be that they enabled others, potential predators, to view children engaged in sexual acts; they left the window open for lecherous eyes to peer in with ease.  Of course there is something troubling, immoral, and potentially dangerous in the production of child pornography, and those adults who act to sexually exploit children, directly or indirectly, should be held accountable. When the exploitation is of oneself, however—and when the intent to distribute is only supposed—it is much harder to determine who is the victim, who the aggressor. ,Meanwhile, the media keeps interest in such cases at a fever pitch, decrying the abuse of children while perpetuating its own sort of perverse voyeurism. “Girls Gone Wild!” trumpets the allegedly respectable Time Magazine, coverage of Michael Jackson’s sexual abuse charges is incessant and unavoidable,  and Fox News covers every molestation or sexual abuse case—whether a conviction or suspicion—with a tinge of fanaticism. ,And in the world of entertainment, it is the gray areas of pornography and pedophilia that fascinate us so, the art that pushes the limits of the permissible.  Cate Blanchett in Notes on a Scandal abuses her position of power to have sex with a minor—or, a horny teenage boy gets lucky with the hot art teacher. Venus too dances around the edges of acceptability. Peter O’Toole and his loud, vulgar paramour may be an unsettling couple—she nineteen, he four times that; and frankly, the thought of the withered, decrepit O’Toole in any amorous situation, physical or otherwise, is slightly nauseating. But both parties are consenting adults and the film remains neutral as to whether O’Toole’s ardor is somehow indecent. It is not the straightforward that fascinates us; it is the boundary—what we can condone, what we can appreciate as entertainment, what we can allow ourselves to accept.  ,And as we flirt with the inadmissible, we simultaneously revise our notions of the desirable. Young women have always been idealized, but today’s high fashion models evoke not adolescence so much as pre-pubescence. Girls as young as fourteen strut down runways on long fragile legs, their demeanor cold, demanding, ruthlessly adult—but unmistakably young. Older models with no breasts or hips to speak up strive for the same aesthetic, that of the de-feminized, the undeveloped. We are horrified by child pornography, but fetishize the child’s body. We condemn the voyeurism of the pedophile but become the voyeurs of those pedophiles—and, by extension, of their victims. ,Sometimes, however, this sort of role reversal allows for blessedly karmic justice. An Oklahoma man, 29, was arrested in January after having posed as a preteen in order to pursue child victims. With shaved body hair, heavy pancake makeup and an affected voice, Neil Rodreick attended the seventh grade for months without attracting suspicion. Stranger still, he lived with two convicted sex offenders, 60 and 43 years of age, whom he persuaded to pose as his uncle and grandfather in order to enroll him in school—having convinced even these men that he was twelve years old. ,When the situation was exposed, these two were also charged with the intent to commit lewd acts with a child. The “child” in question, of course, was not only twenty-nine years old, but a pedophile himself. According to the sheriff, the two men “were very upset when the detectives told them they had been having a sexual relationship with a 29-year-old man and not a pre-teen boy.” Pedophiles unknowingly sheltering and enabling a pedophile in child’s clothing? ,Meta-pedophilia.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/selfpornography_pseudopredation_and_metapedo/,"

"Air travel used to be a real Event with a capital “E,” something that you would dream about and count down to. The old-time airlines like TWA boasted wide aisles, big seats, attractive stewardesses, and complete meals with real silverware for everyone (even the plebs in coach). ,About a year and a half ago, a special exhibit at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam catalogued the downward spiral of airline quality, and the growing divide between first class passengers and those relegated to the back of the Airbus. It was shocking to see the evolution of plane diagrams, the increase of seats from four to six per row, the halving of leg room, and of course, the disappearance of the cushy amenities that made travel so fun disappear entirely. ,Now, you’re lucky to get a bag of peanuts on a transcontinental flight. If you have some cash or a credit card handy, you can pay for food at absurd prices, on top of that three hundred-something dollar ticket you bought at a “discount” price. The flight attendants aren’t all that cute or thin anymore. And the planes are so dirty that you might be more worried about contracting some communicable disease from the walls of the lavatory than from your anonymous Mile High Club hookup.,Still, despite the disappointment, the decades have not robbed us of the best part of flying: the people watching. The five or six hours spent flying across the country are an opportunity to see what’s hot, what’s not, and what clothes really say about a person.,New York-LA flights, or those from the West to the East, offer particularly juicy opportunities to watch people trying very hard to make a great impression. A lot of them seem to be aspiring musicians, actors, or hipsters. Aside from the conservative mothers or grandmothers in traditional travel gear, breezy slacks and pastel cardigan sets, the array of costumes is rather impressive. Many are hipsters – men with super tight jeans, brightly colored sneakers, and funky hats and their female counterparts in the same skinny jeans, oversized tops, and long strategically unkempt hair. Some of them wield a musical instrument, at the very least an i-Phone. ,However, the hipsters are entirely overshadowed by my personal favorites: the people who look like they’re going to some B-list nightclub. I have seen women on transatlantic flights—forget domestic ones—in slinky leopard print dresses, stiletto heels, or skin-tight, black-flared pants with low cut tops. These women tend to wear full makeup, regardless of what time the flight starts (7 am, 10 pm), or how long they’ll be on the plane (4 hours, 13 hours). Their relatives are the fashionistas in full, matching Juicy Couture velour sweatsuits – pants and hoodie, worn best without a shirt underneath to break up the stunning color and fabric. Sometimes, in attempts to fully emulate the style of their role model, they’ll also have a yippy dog in tow in a faux-Louis Vuitton duffel. Unfortunately, that trend (particularly the pink ensemble) went out of style sometime in the early 2000s, along with Britney’s virginity and belly shirts. ,First-class passengers seem to have their own particular dress code. Most men wear some sort of suit, which I can’t complain about. It’s practical and sharp, and as long as we’re not dealing with Princeton ties or some other obnoxious accessory, the suit is the easiest way for a man on the go to impress his seatmate. Women tend to display jewelry that they would only wear to some sort of black tie affair. This is to indicate that they deserve to be in first class. If the diamonds are out on display, everyone knows that this was no free upgrade—those uptight bitches paid full price for that ticket (or their husbands did, more likely).,Then there are those, like me, who opt for function over form. We’re the slobs in sweat pants and oversized sweaters and leggings huddling in the corner trying to get some sleep. Every time I travel with my mom, she urges me to pick something more “sophisticated,” now that I’m an adult. Maybe I should take her advice. This morning, the woman scanning my ticket called me “young lady.” Apparently even in jeans and a headband I look like a tween. Let’s be honest, no one uses the phrase “young lady” with anyone over the age of 14.  The truth is that über casual dress was entirely unacceptable for air travel until quite recently. While I may scoff, somewhat enviously, at the women and men in their trim and tailored vacation wear, their ability to reconcile comfort with sophistication is the stuff that old-fashioned air travel was made of.,Many argue that the decline in service and the unkempt appearance of passengers are self-reinforcing trends. When they’re serving drinks to fat people in Slipknot t-shirts, what incentives do flight attendants have to impress? When you’re not going to have room to stretch your legs, why wear anything more constricting than spandex? Hats off to people who resist the desire to be comfortable and still make the plane’s aisle a catwalk. We salute you. If there were enough of you, maybe I’d be eating a juicy steak and not a bag of stale peanuts in my sardine can coach class seat.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/dont-fly-coach/,"

"“If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.”,-Jesus, Matthew 18:8,“Your right eye is half-a-millimeter too high,” Dr. Christian Troy informs an aspiring model during the pilot-episode of Nip/Tuck.  “And you have an Irish nose,” he quickly adds as if the physiognomic comment of a moment previous had not been sufficiently condemnatory.  But don’t worry: he can fix it.  He’s a sculptor of life, a certified magician, a facial thaumaturge, and a psychotherapist of the highest order – he’s a high-class plastic surgeon.  ,The very same episode features a drug-dealer shelling out $300,000 for a clandestine face-change operation; later we see surgical procedure turn to a fraternal assassination, turn to a bloodbath in which the bathing agent is not blood but adipose. Those who saw that pilot episode must have realized that here was something new and fresh and hilarious on television.  A whole new horizon of superficiality had become possible.,Imagine a show in which it’s OK for every character to be an asshole. Imagine a,show whose characters are largely unbound by norms of decorum or propriety.  It’s not that they’re amoral.  It’s just that for the characters of Nip/Tuck, the inner protestations of conscience are not so much negative conditions of action as aesthetic embroidery for an irresistible criminality.  Imagine a show for which verisimilitude is at most a frantic afterthought.  Imagine a show in which characters don’t make good choices, or even mediocre ones.  Imagine a show situated at that controversial and ugly crossroads of modern life, the plastic-surgery salon.  Now imagine the creative freedom, dramatic potential, and hilarious capacity such a show would possess. ,Nip/Tuck operates according to the same picaresque structure which undergirds dramas like E.R. and The O.C.: a recurring cast of familiar characters tackles episodic crises du jour in the foreground while exploring persistent fault-lines, conflicts, and tensions in the background over a season or beyond.  However, Nip/Tuck is neither encumbered by the moral imperative of saving lives and atmosphere of perpetual emergency which frame E.R. nor hampered by the cloying sentimentality which afflicts The O.C..  Here’s a synopsis of pretty much every episode of Nip/Tuck:,Patient: [requests frivolous, unethical, or just crazy surgery],Dr. McNamara: [upset] We can’t do that!,Dr. Troy [smiles] Or can we…?,Dr. McNamara: [bored] Whatever.,[surgery montage],[consequences],[sex?]	,The range of procedures performed on this show truly runs the gamut in terms of patient personality, physical site of operation, degree of frivolity or necessity, and music-choice accompanying the surgery-montages which appear as frequently as commercials.  Here are some medical anecdotes from Nip/Tuck which old Hippocrates might not countenance, but Nielsen sure would:,1.	McNamara’s girlfriend is worried that the inscrutable lines of her palm bode ill for their relationship.  McNamara, having attentively listened to her concerns, allays them by surgically connecting her love-line to her wisdom-line.,2.	Two collegiate twins are tired of being mistaken for one another.  Since things such as not attending the same university or not wearing nearly identical outfits are apparently too onerous, they elect to pursue the only reasonable option: expensive cosmetic surgery.  Later, Christian beds them both at the same time.,3.	Performing breast-reduction surgery on a female lawyer at the behest of one of her multiple-personalities, the soi-disant “Sassy,” who just wants to be a normal eight-year-old girl.,4.	In walks Natasha Charles, an attractive blind woman whose clothes are suspiciously well color-coordinated.  A hypertrophy of the olfactory sense has allowed her to profit as a perfume-designer, and now she wants plastic surgery in order to net a handsome blind man.  Later, Christian beds her.,5.	Helping an indigent woman fulfill her dream of “looking like J-lo.”  I don’t remember whether Christian has sex with this one, but really it’s overwhelmingly probable.,Character-wise the central antithesis of the show lies between the two principal doctors.  Dr. Sean McNamara is a stereotypical doctor: boring, workaholic, family-man, principled, etc.  Dr. Christian Troy embodies a different type: turbulent, relaxed, bachelor, pleasure-principled.  Yet for all their differences, both doctors are handsome, tanned, and athletic.  Sean’s wife Julie once dreamed of becoming a pediatrician but deferred that dream while Sean was in medical school.  ,Other characters include Liz, the lesbian anesthesiologist who offers a gruff voice of wisdom and general disapproval; Sean and Julie’s troubled and occasionally violent son, Matt; and Kimber, Christian’s on-again off-again, make-up-in-the-form-of-a-three-way girlfriend.  ‘Kimber,’ as her non-standard name suggests, is an idiot, but as the seasons progress, she becomes stronger, more emotionally independent, and also a director of hit pornographies.,“Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life”,-Falstaff, Henry IV Part 1,Unfortunately for Bardolph, the target of Falstaff’s quip, he lived in a rude age unapprised of rhinoplasty and dermabrasion.  Nevertheless, Falstaff’s explicit conjugation of the physical and personal is apt from the show’s standpoint.  The premise and locale of Nip/Tuck allow for an extraordinary capacity of physical metaphor.  Inevitably the medical transformation achieved mirrors or opposes some emotional or personal transformation either actualized or desiderated.  ,At the beginning of every consultation Sean and Christian instruct each patient, “Tell us what you don’t like about yourself.”  The request is ambiguously poised between a diagnostic program of cosmetic modification and a personal critique of life-change.  It is telling that the patient always responds not with a direct proposal of surgery but with a complicated narrative of his or her life so far and how this surgical procedure will dovetail with its new personal direction.,In one episode the doctors confront “Mama Boone,” a massive (1000+ lbs.) woman.  Mama Boone hasn’t gotten up from her couch in three years, and her skin itself has grown fused into its synthetic fibers.  Once the early signs of necrotizing fasciitis appear, however, it is crucial that she be removed from the couch immediately and the infected flesh excised.  In her everything sedentary, hesitative, repressed, and stagnant in the lives of the characters is congealed and made flesh. ,Kraken-like, she strikes both doctors into personal realization before rapidly departing to a final triplex of adjacent grave plots.  Sean realizes that he can’t dilate his marriage’s separation-process into perpetuity; it’s time to move on, time to leave his mental couch.  And Christian realizes that he can’t sulk forever just because he was attacked and raped by a serial killer (seriously, this actually happened).,Sigmund Freud, in his early essay The Aetiology of Hysteria, begins to articulate the psychosomatic causality which will inform his mature psychology.  Freud claims (at this time) that every hysterical symptom is the physical terminus of an associative chain leading back to some childhood sexual encounter.,Therapeutic practice takes the form of a guided excavation of associations and memories until at the right moment the cathectic energy of the transference-relationship may be turned to devastating use and dissolve the latent factor – like the calculated blow of the osteotome with which a surgeon deliberately re-breaks a nose in order to reset it.,However, Freud never considered the most obviously direct kind of therapy.  That is to say, if thine nose offends thee, get a rhinoplasty as opposed to a psychotherapist.  Whereas Freud described the physical symptom as the apparent compromise of a latent desire, Nip/Tuck installs the surgical procedure as the teleological sign-post towards a new life.,There is one episode in particular (3.1) which stands out as a tour de force of intricate and incredible metaphor.  Sean and Christian are at the cusp of professional dissolution.  They have just one last pro bono procedure to perform: separating conjoined twins who vocally comment every ten seconds on how much they love each other and will regret being disjoined.  Oh, and they have to share a tiny dorm room the night before the surgery.,During the procedure both twins die, but the stronger twin only dies only because she stipulated a do-not-resuscitate clause in the case of her sister’s prior decease.  In addition, the twins are sown back together as a funerary arrangement in accordance with their will.  Sean and Christian, touched by this morbid gesture of consanguinity and concretized spectacle of togetherness, decide to give their own professional union and friendship another shot.  Also, Sean hires a prostitute to have sex with both of them while responding to the name of “Julia.”,The miracle of Nip/Tuck is that despite its Grand-Guignol hijinks and credibility-straining antics the show actually manages to put across a compelling portrait of the turmoil and folly of modern life.  The “Mama Boone” episode – despite its freakish and teratological component – is genuinely touching and pitiable.  One actually empathizes with her as she recounts the alarming crescence of her fear and torso. Reminiscent of the best parts of Balzac, Nip/Tuck has a knack for presenting what is most wretched, pathetic, funny, and endearing about humanity.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/polymorphously_hilarious/,"

"I had never heard of neo-futurism before seeing Theatre Intime’s production of “Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind.” I probably never would have heard of it and I probably will never hear of it again. From what I gather neo-futurists are an obscure group of writers, directors and actors who are committed to strengthening the bond between performer and audience by creating plays that are as sincere and genuine as possible. In order to do this, the neo-futurists employ tactics that include adding random and unpredictable events to performances. This, as they claim, removes “the expected and permanent” aspect of stage theatre by allowing performances to feel like an extension of everyday living. The Princeton production of this neo-futurist production manages, for the most part, to embody the spirit of neo-futurist philosophy. It’s well done. It’s playing again this weekend. You should go and see it.,“Too Much Light” begins when you try to buy your ticket: you’re confronted with the option of paying standard price for a ticket or rolling a die to determine your ticket price. “Ah ha,” you say to yourself with a smug look, “this must be part of that neo-futurist nonsense I read about.” As you’re still smirking at your own cleverness, an actor from the play walks up and asks your name, permanent marker and name-tag in hand. You give them your name and, to your utter astonishment, you have been re-christened “Smelly” or “Door Frame” or something along those lines. You enter the theatre anyway, perhaps slightly unnerved, excited or simply relieved. ,The first thing you might notice is the noise, general chaos and excessive amount of alcohol consumption surrounding you. You sink into your seat and see that on the stage there is a clothesline with the numbers 1-30 hanging on it. The play begins and two emcees, Tyler Crosby ’09 and Ashley Alexander ’09, come on stage to pantomime warped flight instructions. It’s interactive. You awkwardly hold the hand of the faculty member next to you. You learn –perhaps unnecessarily – that drinking is encouraged during the show.,Suddenly the cast emerges from the audience and the show begins. The way it works, as you discover, is that the audience shouts out numbers and, after the emcees pick a number from the clothesline, the actors run out and perform the corresponding play. You might suspect that all the random aspects of the play, such as audience participation and skit choice, are actually contrived and orchestrated, but, as you’re later pleased to find, they’re actually not. Over the next 80 minutes, you find yourself experiencing a vast array of emotions and thoughts, which might include but are not limited to: tickled, bewildered, impressed, entertained, alarmed, sad, inspired, enlightened, offended, uncomfortable, moved, indifferent or affirmed. You can’t help but be impressed by the raw energy of the show and the alertness of the cast in relation to each other, their surroundings and the audience. You find it hard to be bored since approximately every two minutes promises a new set of characters, a new plot, a new tone and new possibilities of interaction. You might get screamed at, you might have to stand up in the audience and do Kegels, you might get naked on stage or you might have to sit in complete darkness and let people whisper in your ears. The show ends all too quickly.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/blinded_by_the_light/,"

"Environmental science is a real buzz-kill. I never expected it to be all bird calls and daisies, or pictures of ponies, but in my high school class, we regularly sat through hour-long lectures that kicked off with informed statistics about getting fried alive by UV rays in the year 2028, we rang in the half hour with accounts of the disappearing tropical rain forest, and we’d come to a dramatic close with slide shots of Alaskan seal pups submerged in a bath of oil from a recent spill, their eyes weighed shut by the syrupy petroleum. It was a little much, before breakfast. ,	The problem wasn’t that it was melodramatic; if it waxed sensational, it did so deservedly. It wasn’t even that it was overly apocalyptic; it was based on sound scientific data. The problem was that the material was presented in such a way that left most listeners with only one realistic reaction: a sort of numbness to the sheer abstraction and so-called inevitability of it all.  ,Rather than becoming angry or scared at what we heard – both valid and appropriate responses – we were steered in a different direction by the tag-on which accompanies such material with perverse frequency: “And there’s nothing you can do about it.” Bemoan it, they told us, but accept it, because this is the bed we’ve made.,	In the aftermath of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, conservation has become voguish. Air conditioning units in the White House are being shut down. Computers are being turned off at the end of the day. There’s talk of bike racks and carpools. President Bush stood outside the Department of Energy a few weeks ago and told Americans that if they could avoid going on “a trip that’s not essential, that would be helpful.” It appears that the most Earth-unfriendly of administrations is turning a green leaf. ,I’ve spent a fair bit of time in recent days, (I will leave out the exact numerical figure), on a new website, www.energyhog.org. This website is home to Energy Hog, the half-hog, half-human face of Bush’s new conservation plan. The website features profiles of the various hogs (Mork Pork is “one nasteeeee oinker”; Hal Hogg eats broken-down appliances), training games (complete all 5 and you can become an Official Hog Buster), and a scavenger hunt.,	Part of the lure is probably the games; like most Americans, I enjoy a good, free computer game. But this is mixed with is a sort of disbelief: are they serious? Is this the public face of the Bush Administration’s “conservation” efforts?  ,	Lest we delude ourselves yet again (WMD’s, anyone?), we must understand that nothing’s changed: Bush’s policies are still entirely dominated by the price of oil. This new push for conservation is just Bush’s fixation in a hemp outfit, one more attempt to bring down the price per gallon. As Bush cuts down on unnecessary travel with his 52nd helicopter trip to the Gulf to survey the damage, EPA regulations are being waived, protected areas are being proposed for drilling, and environmental standards are being loosened in the name of “post-Katrina recovery,” the idea that this is just a “temporary disruption” in American oil flow.  ,	Conservation and America could be such a beautiful couple. If the government was willing to stand up boldly in the face of industry and give the American people direction, tell them that protecting the environment is important, that it is our responsibility, that things will not just keep being okay because they’ve always been okay, then we could really get somewhere. Unfortunately, being told to ride your bike to work if it’s not too much of a hassle – at least until gas prices drop again – does not send this message. It sends an altogether different one: let’s all work together to get exactly where we were before. ,	I’m not willing to relinquish the idea that environmental science doesn’t have to be a buzz-kill – it can be a motivating force that changes society.  But like so many other things, the pressure from the top to initiate this change will probably have to wait three more long years.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/bushs_new_environmentalism/,"

"Bill Gates descended on campus last Friday, and everyone in Richardson Auditorium had Microsoft founder’s rock star status impressed upon them.  Audience members were greeted by a 21st century audio-visual display: two high-definition monitors and a gigantic projector screen, all of which prominently displayed Microsoft and Princeton logos along with the sounds of U2, Jet, and Coldplay.  It was theatrically perfect: aging geek as rock star.,Men and women in suits and ties – part of the entourage – told you where you couldn’t sit.  And at one side of the stage, opposite the podium, was a small table on which rested several expensive toys: a digital camera on an elevated stand, a PC attached to a much smaller camera, and a modest white box, instantly recognizable to video game junkies as the Xbox 360.  ,	Princeton owes Gates’ visit to the Crystal Tiger Award, which claims to be “awarded each year by the undergraduates of Princeton University to an individual who has had a transformative impact on their lives.”,In this sense, there were few choices as apt as Gates.  Suffice to say that President Tilghman’s introductory statement that, “our guest is a man who needs no introduction” was more than sufficient.  The heartbreak was that Gates did not make a special stop at Princeton, but rather included us as part of a six-college tour.  Did we give up our Crystal Tiger for naught?  Certainly, there was a noticeable disconnect between the presenters’ remarks and Gates’; the award committee thanked him for his philanthropy, while Gates spoke entirely about the future of software and technological development.,	Gates is a brilliant evangelist for computers.  His speech focused on innovation in software and hardware through the lens of Microsoft and, correspondingly, contained a heavy dose of self-promotion. Gates’ presentation opened with a film of recent Princeton graduates now at Microsoft, and those present were able to see former Quad and ICC President Corey Sanders wearing a toga and talking about Microsoft’s casual dress code (Conveniently, after the speech one could go to Science & Tech Career fair at Dillon to find… Corey Sanders, recruiting for Microsoft.) Gates also showed a Napoleon Dynamite crossover video that encouraged you to buy Office 2005 to replace Office 2000.,	Outside of these promotional moments, however, Gates made a careful and calculated speech to interest undergraduates in computers.  In combining a 1950s-esque portrait of the potential of technology with the energy of a high-school motivational speaker, Gates painted a rosy and bright future for all mankind. ,According to Gates, anything can be digitized, anything can be represented as data. Gates rattled off the possibilities: personalized television (and personally directed ads), translation software, technology for the disabled, wireless to unify devices.  The development of software concerns the world and concerns the youth of today.  The future of software is dependent on research now, and the best source of researchers is young college graduates (And despite the one-note speech, Gates has a pretty good rationale: the number of computer science graduates at American universities has declined in recent years, and this loss is certainly a concern for any forward-looking company).,	By showing off his toys, Gates gave his words substance, each of the demonstrations looking further ahead.  He first demonstrated a new digital picture manager, Microsoft Max, which has impressive features in terms of speed, display, and image sharing, but is not otherwise revolutionary.  This was followed with the Xbox 360, which will serve as a unified music, video, and game system.  ,It was the third demonstration that best illustrated Gates’ theme of software’s increasing utility.  Placing a cell phone in front of the elevated camera, Gates brought up an interface that allowed him to download additional information to the phone, make notes on it using a stylus, and control it with several vocal commands.  While clearly in development, it was an excellent example of the importance of industrial research.  Unstated but nevertheless understood was a message that if you joined Microsoft then you, too, could help bring this future into being.,The audience also learned that Gates is terrible at Project Gotham Racing and that he enjoys the Dave Matthews Band.  ,While Gates’ speech was largely upbeat – it didn’t hint at any of the conflicts between operating systems, developers and digital rights that are fixtures of our digital era – the Q&A at the end of the talk was devoted to these issues.  Gates was grilled on the need for better security to maintain data privacy, the feasibility of using digital rights management to preserve intellectual property, and on how he would change patent law given Microsoft’s position as the defendant in much patent litigation.  ,Gates bobbed and weaved his way through the answers, generally providing well-founded thirty-second capsule responses.  He came out strongly in favor of American patent law (although he hoped for stronger protection of demonstration of prior art and better pay for patent examiners) and emphasized that Microsoft was not by default on the side of “large corporations” in such conflicts.  ,Gates acknowledged certain technological pitfalls, but nonetheless insisted that the future is bright.  And in the end, this isn’t a vision one really wants to find fault with.  It’s easy to object to a future in which computers run most every aspect of our lives, but there is no reason to believe that it’s not coming.  And given that expectation, there are far worse visions than the one that Gates provides.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/mr_gates_comes_to_call/,"

"In a past life (i.e., one year ago), I was an undergraduate and an RA at WashU. It was kind of a big deal, thanks. But with that Big Deal came Big Responsibility—namely, diversity training. ,Unless you’re a complete asshole, diversity training usually entails preaching to the choir. You just sit around and discuss all the “isms” you already know to avoid—racism, sexism, heterosexism, republicanism, et cetera. However, toward the end of my run as an RA, I was introduced to the latest technology in diversity gaming—“What Stands Between Us: Diversity Conversation Flash Cards” by Stir Fry Productions ($50.00). These cards operate under the assumption that we, as Americans, are too afraid to tell each other what we really think and so, with the help of “four hundred questions that people of color and EuroAmericans have always wanted to ask each other,” we might finally begin to tackle the issue of race. In short, these weren’t ordinary flash cards; these cards would change the way I thought. They would make me a Better Man. ,I don’t think a typical article would suffice in conveying the power of these cards. So instead, I sought out a “EuroAmerican” here at Princeton to read through some of the cards with me. EuroAmericans being in short supply, I settled for a WASP named Kip. Kip and I agreed to be completely honest with each other—very Dean-and-Carlo of On the Road fame. Very American. Being more on the caramel-brown side of the skin-tone spectrum, I took the “colored” side of the deck. What follows is an actual dramatization of our interaction (what the cards say is in italics; the phrases have not been altered):,Before we began, I offered Kip some tea because it’s the polite thing to do. All I had was TAZO Awake®, but the wrapper gave us a good starting point for our talk. I read it to Kip. “Imagine yourself on a lush tea estate in India around the turn of the century. Your breakfast tea would have tasted a good deal like Awake.” I asked Kip if he found that slogan a little ridiculous; you know, given history and all. Kip smiled and said, “Colonial India, huh? Great times. My great-grandfather ran a tea plantation, I think.” I replied, “No kidding? My great-grandfather worked on one.” Kip said, “Hey! Maybe they knew each other! Small world.” I suggested that we start the game.,I let Kip go first and he read from the card, “Can I touch your hair?” ,Me: Okay.,Kip: It’s oilier than mine. ,Me: I haven’t washed it today.,Kip: Is that a cultural thing? That’s really fascinating to me. ,Me: Okay, my turn, Kip. Do all white people have lice?,At this point, I think we were finally starting to break down barriers. Kip said, “I wouldn’t say all…” but then he took a deep breath and remembered our pact of absolute honesty and continued, “Yes. My god, yes. I’ve wanted to tell someone that for so long.” He wept and looked as though he could use a hug. But I wasn’t about to go anywhere near his lice-infested scalp.,Eventually, we persevered. It was Kip’s turn and he obliged with, “If a white person has a higher rank than you, do you really think of them in a ‘master’ role?” I thought back to all my previous jobs, and I realized that every time my pale-skinned bosses told me to “stop taking two hour lunch breaks” or to “stop stealing pastries from the display case,” they were trying to keep me from getting my slice of the pie. Literally (rimshot, please). I asked Kip if, when working under such conditions, there was really any other way to think of my bosses. He nervously conceded this point, and I could see that the game was starting to get to him. So I kept going.,Me: “Do you ever acknowledge that North America is not your country, that it is still colonized and that you have no intention of giving it back?” ,Kip: “What about Manifest Destiny? Are you telling me that god didn’t tell our forefathers to expand? You can’t be serious. Can you?” ,Me: “Kip, are you calling the game a liar?”,Kip could only respond by drawing his next card and asking, “Do you think of white folks as barbarians?” Hello? Have you seen Braveheart, Kip? I could only nod yes, afraid that my words would shatter him. We continued on in this way. Kip read such gems as, “Why can’t you just be American, rather than setting yourself apart?” and “Can you forgive me for hating you?” and “Is it amusing to watch white men dancing?” and “Are black women simply women who happen to be black?” I’m not even sure what that last one means. ,For my turns, I read, “Do you really believe in all the lies on how this country is built?” and “Would you give up your privilege for me?” and “Tell us one racist thing you have done.” That one’s my personal favorite. It’s not even a question—just a bold slap to the face.,Clearly, this wasn’t a Diversity Game. This was a Diversity Slaughter. With every card drawn, I was breaking his spirit and elevating mine a little bit more. In Kip’s defense, there wasn’t much he could do. The deck was stacked against him. It was vengeance thousands of years in the making, and all for just $50. I finally understood the new direction diversity training is taking. It is not enough to simply make the majority aware of various minorities. It is not enough to teach people to look past differences. Diversity training must make the majority feel guilty for being the majority. It must humiliate the majority.,I used to accept responsibility for things. When I was told I’d never make it as a baseball player, I didn’t think it was because I’m brown, but because I hit .162. in tee-ball. When I got rejected from various colleges, I didn’t think that it was because I was caramel. I thought it was because it took a special kind of idiot to hit .162 in tee-ball. But now I’m not so sure. Thanks to these diversity flash cards, I’ve found the perfect scapegoat for all my shortcomings. It is because I’m brown. My god, why didn’t I see this before?,By the end of the game, Kip was pretty worked up. At last, he drew a card that seemed both a burden and a blessing. He knew it would be difficult to read, but he also knew that reading it would solve all the world’s problems. It would liberate him from his White Guilt and me from my crippling sense of racial inferiority. At last Kip took the plunge and read, “On behalf of the entire white race, I would like to apologize for everything we have ever done wrong.” There it was. Now that he’s said it, the healing could begin. Racial oppression and tension could completely disappear now thanks to those few flippant words breezily printed on a 2×4 piece of paper. We’ve all been skirting the issue, burying it under “solutions” like affirmative action and social justice initiatives. But these are just quick fixes. Kip here has been brave enough to do the hard work in dissolving racial inequality.,So, come on my fellow minorities. It was a nice scapegoat while it lasted, but now it’s over and done with. He has apologized. He’s sorry. On behalf of everyone. For everything. So quit your bitchin’ and accept the apology. ,And to think, this whole time all we needed was something as simple and fun as flashcards!",http://www.nassauweekly.com/minorityjack/,"

There’s American Studies professor Bill Gleason on the exercise bike, reading about celebrities in his purple t-shirt and exercise shorts. Lifting free weights is Paul Moreno of the Politics Department. Later today, the versatile English professor Jeff Nunokawa may be reading Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on the Stairmaster. Let’s sit down with some of them and see how they stay in such good shape. ,When one student was asked to think of professors with noteworthy muscles, he simply responded, “Nunokawa, man. Nunokawa.” Who is this legendary fin de siecle scholar underneath the tight t-shirt? Turns out this Hawaiian-born Japanese man of steel is the master of the Stairmaster. His hour of high-stepping is “quite efficient,” as it allows him “the opportunity to read duller works in my field,” as well as “difficult but brilliant” writings. Surprisingly, he never did sports in high school or college—“I couldn’t bear the prospect of losing,” he said. In general he prefers the indoors for exercising; he does jog in New York City, but the pollution makes him reconsider. His diet includes “anything in front of me,” especially fried foods, but he says that in general he does not eat much. So why does he exercise? Exercising is therapeutic, he says, thereby “saving a fortune in prescriptions.” The anxiety he builds up during the day evaporates in the gym. As for students exercising beside their professors, Nunokawa has no fears. “Whatever judgments they’ve made about us they’ve made quite apart from the gym,” he says. ,After he gets off the weight machine and heads for water, we stop Paul Moreno, a visiting professor in the Madison Program in the Politics Department. He doesn’t teach, but his shoulders are commendable for their heft. What’s his secret? Apparently he alternates between aerobic and anaerobic exercise. He plays squash, uses the weight room, does the nautilus machine, and runs outside. ,Now let’s hop on the exercise bike next to Bill Gleason. He says he usually does the stationary bike, lifts an assortment of weights, and plays racquetball. “Sometimes it’s a little awkward to see students here,” he says. “I try to avoid peak student hours.” What does this expert in American history and literature have to say about exercise historically? Surprise—he’s written a book called The Leisure Ethic: Work and Play in American Literature, 1840-1940 (Stanford University Press, 1999) that tells all. In the 1840s German immigrants brought ideals of gymnastic education to America, which launched the first fitness clubs and started a longstanding interest in fitness, he says. The public started spending money on playgrounds, and public schools institutionalized sports teams and gym classes in the late 19th century. About one hundred years ago there was a serious exercise and bodybuilding movement, beginning with Teddy Roosevelt, he says. ,We think waking up at 11 was sort of early, but while we were sleeping, History professor Sheldon Garon wasn’t. He tries to get about 40 minutes of exercise daily starting at 7:30 or 7:45. During most of the year he buffs up by kayaking on Lake Carnegie with his personal kayak, biking outdoors, or playing tennis, varying the routine. When the temperature drops, Dillon calls, but he calls his activities there “mult-tasking” rather than “working out.” On the exercise bike he reads the New York Times, and he looks to incorporate the international news into his lectures and research. As for diet, Professor Garon has the luxury of a high metabolism, so he always rewards himself with a muffin or scone after exercising. He avoids fatty foods but loves carbs. ,English professor Robert Tignor ruptured two Achilles tendons and had meniscus damage, so he stopped playing tennis and squash. Fortunately these setbacks did not rob him of the desire and need for cardiovascular exercise at Dillon. After a good stretch he moves on to the Stairmaster, does some lifting, some Stairmaster action, and a “vigorous workout” on the stationary bike. What keeps him motivated? He writes: “I am intrigued by the machines that provide all kinds of calculations, and love feel that I am burning off calories.  So, I make a beeline for those bike and stair master machines that are the easiest to use and show the greatest amount of calorie burning.  I realize that this is cheating, but it keeps my spirits high.” He also rides his bike to and from the office when the weather is tolerable, and occasionally goes for a 20-mile bike ride with friends. ,We have no evidence Deputy Registrar Robert Bromfield is the “gangsta” the Triangle Show celebrates, but he does know how to stay in shape. Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and some Saturdays, he’s in Dillon strength training for 45 minutes—upper and lower body—and doing cardio for 30 minutes. He also does an hour of calisthenics each morning except Sunday. At 5’7” and 125 lbs he says he’s “not interested in gaining bulk, just tying to keep lean and trim.” This vegetarian does his best to get his balanced diet with proteins, carbs, and fiber, but he maintains a mission to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie. His general advice for the prospective buff: “I would ,caution common sense, and to listen to one’s body.  After all, diet and ,exercise should be about creating balance and harmony in mind, body, and spirit.”,German Professor Jamie Rankin said “aloha” to the gym last year while training for a marathon in Hawaii. He and three ‘05ers did long runs on the weekend and shorter runs during the week in preparation for their glorious December run in Honolulu, where Rankin did his postdoctoral study. The students’ training routes included the towpath, a road towards New Brunswick, and out Elm Rd. Right now he’s training with two seniors to do the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington D.C. When not training for these 26.2-mile runs, he goes to the gym 2-3 times a week for some lifting. “I enjoy keeping physically fit as much as possible, and I’m enjoying spending time getting to know the students,” he said. ,Other Beauties in the Ivy Tower,Though no one has corroborated their presence in the gym, some professors may be considered buff nonetheless. Bo Honoré, chair of the Department of Economics, has been described as “a giant.” One student said that he “could be an armored knight in the Middle Ages.” Jason Lyall, assistant professor in Politics and the Woodrow Wilson School, was called “dreamy” by a male student in the department. D. Graham Bernett, professor of the History of Science, is on leave this semester, but he seems to have a following of fans gawking over his build. And who doesn’t swoon when Politics professor Maurizio Viroli pedals by on his heroic bike in a blue suit? Did Machiavelli bike too?,Where are the buff women? ,We know Princeton has them, but the two most notorious—Engineering School Dean and marathon-runner Maria Klawe, and English professor and maven of “dirty words” Sophie Gee—were unable to be reached in time for this publication.

"It’s been a rough Thursday night.  It’s getting late; the Cottage bouncers won’t let you in, and the seven beers you just chugged are slowly finding their way into your system.  You say your goodbyes and as you pass Prospect House, your evening suddenly comes tumbling out of your mouth and splashes all over the flagstones.  You stumble home and fall into bed, but the contents of your stomach remain, lonely and congealed in Prospect Garden.  What happens to your vomit?  Which magical little elves comes and clean it up, so when you groan your way out of bed, you don’t step in it on your way to class?,	The singularly important responsibility of cleaning up vomit belongs not to elves but regular people—the Princeton Grounds and Maintenance Crew.,	Tucked away into a cramped office at the back of MacMillan, Jim Consolloy oversees the operations of grounds maintenance.  A soft-spoken, genial man, Consolloy has been at Princeton since 1989 and doesn’t plan on leaving soon.,	“The grounds maintenance manager is a long-tenured position,” he said.  “My predecessor was here for 13 years and the one before that was here for 15.  And the very first grounds manager was here from 1928 until 1962.”  He leans back in his chair.  “Yep, we’re usually here for a good while,” he said, tugging at his Facilities and Grounds vest, (“Jim” is proudly emblazoned on the top right side).,	With a staff of 40 and responsibilities from soil aeration to tree fertilization, Consolloy keeps busy mostly with meetings, memos, and administrative duties.  However, the duties and day of his crew start long before most students hit the snooze button.  Normally, they pick up litter and clean up the previous night’s destruction from six to seven.,	This is often a thankless task.  “Some students are really appreciative. They say hello and thanks.  The rest just sort of walk by without noticing.”,	At daybreak, the groundskeepers come across some exceedingly strange things.  George Morgan, now 63, has worked for Princeton since 1961, on the grounds crew since the mid-70s.  Now in charge of the crew that covers campus east of Washington Road, Morgan has just about seen it all.,	Oddly enough, some of the strangest sights he has come across during his tenure involve the Robertson Fountain.,	“We came out and there was this Volkswagen, the water up to its doors.  Then there was this other time,” he paused, relishing the moment.  “We were on our way to start the day and there’s something stuck on top of the fountain—where the water comes out.  We get a little closer,” he paused again, for effect.  “And it’s a pig’s head.  Can you believe that?  A real pig’s head stuck up there.”,	“It can be weird sometimes,” he added.  “We’ll find a chair or a couch just thrown out sometimes.  But normally, it’s just cups, cans and trash.”,	After dealing with the trash and “objects” left over from the night before, at around 7:30, the crews begin mowing, leaf-blowing and “general” grounds maintenance in the academic and administrative buildings.  After a 9:30 break they move on to the residential areas.,	“We try to be as unobtrusive as possible.  We know students need their sleep and so try keep out of their way and make sure most of the work in their class area is done by the time they get there,” he said.  “I guess you could say the creed is—unlike most of Princeton,” he grins sardonically, “Try NOT to be obvious.”,	Following the Groundskeeping creed, unbeknownst to most students, the University puts a huge amount of thought, effort, and money into making sure Princeton is and remains gorgeous.  In fact, most of the decisions about grounds and grounds planning are made with strict regard to how it will affect the “student.”  ,	Starting at the Board of Trustees’ Grounds and Buildings Committee (formulates policy and gives permission) to the Facilities Planning Group (procures funds and makes schedules) to the weekly-meeting Landscape Committee (implements policy and schedules), attention is given to how the grounds and plants will affect the students not only physically but psychologically as well.,	For example, the grounds plans of the forthcoming Whitman College have, down to the foot, a detailing of which and what trees and plants will go where.  Each tree and shrub is carefully selected first by a professional landscape architect and then reviewed by Consolloy himself.,	“We not only look at whether this tree is right for this climate, is the soil right, etc., but also how it will look and the effect it will have on students.  For example, the evergreen.  We use a lot of them on campus—especially near Prospect Garden,” he said, becoming animated.  ,	“Why? They remain green year round and they give off a warmth,” he paused.  “Not just physically—blocking the wind, but coming back from class on one of those nasty late winter days, would you want to see a spindly, dormant, half-dead-looking oak or a giant, vibrant, snow-laden evergreen?”  He paused again.  “You know, things on campus just aren’t thrown in randomly.”,	In fact, the Princeton grounds department has honed the planting, placement and upkeep of its trees to something of an art.  According to Consolloy (who has seen every other Ivy with the exception of Dartmouth), Princeton has one of the most intense grounds maintenance programs in the Ivy League.,	“We have a more intense planting schedule.  It’s not excessive, but much more labor-intensive,” he said.  “And, unlike other schools, we’ve recognized the value of having older trees and spending more on keeping them healthy and growing than constantly planting new ones.”,	Reunions is consistently one of the biggest problems the Grounds staff faces.  Every year, the painstakingly maintained grounds are virtually destroyed in little over a week.  A massive amount of beer (which, although raising the pH of the soil slightly, doesn’t really affect grass growth) is spilled, grass is trampled, and trash piles up everywhere.  ,	Still, Morgan is quite complimentary of the graduated Princetonians.,	“They’re always very courteous.  Even when I’m setting up bleachers or tents or tables or whatever, they’ll insist on having a drink with me,” he said.  “Although I can’t drink on the job, they get real excited when I accept the beers and just put them in my pockets for later.”,	Consolloy, views Reunions through a different, more administrative perspective.  “It really is one of the toughest times for us.  During Reunions, we sort of lose control and we usually have to restart everything,” he said with an air of resignation.  “We aerate the compacted soil, reseed, watch it grow, and then it happens all over again.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/cleaning_up_your_puke/,"

"There was a time when the idea of a different spin on the dry humor of The Daily Show might have made sense. Around the time that Stewart and co. produced America: The Book, they were a twister (or some other forceful natural phenomenon) of popular criticism with an immense influence on the countryï¿½s youth. If some exceptionally creative folk wanted to satirize the hostï¿½s persona, or the occasionally cutesy segments, or the behavior of the correspondents, then, with a certain amount of intelligence and skill, this mighty task might have been achieved. ,If they wanted to make the humor on this satirical show particularly conservative, so be it, as long as they got good comedy out of it. This would have been quite difficult, even for some of the best writers around, since The Daily Show is hardly a straightforward news program; it would have been akin to an attempt to spoof the Austin Powers movies, since they themselves are a response to the already-jocular Bond films. But, hard as it might have been, the result of such an effort could have earned our respect. Such a thing cannot be said of Fox News Channelï¿½s recent birth, ï¿½The Half-Hour News Hour.ï¿½,We are at a strange moment in the publicï¿½s relationship with Murdochï¿½s cable network. Its numbers have fallen significantly, but it is still far and away the most popular channel of its kind. FNC and its parent company are insulated enough that they allow Matt Groening and Seth MacFarlane to ridicule the administration they adore in almost every new episode of their shows. Yet, self-assured and smug though they might want to seem, their shrinking viewership, for example, suggests that there are indeed cracks in their veneer.,After 2004ï¿½s documentary Outfoxed was released, the vocal minority, outraged by the willful dishonesty of the network, was joined by an increasing number of people who had previously ignored or avoided the popular channel. The mild chortle at its ï¿½Fair and Balancedï¿½ slogan became a marginally deafening roar of laughter, and Olbermann began to make Oï¿½Reilly so mad that the ï¿½Factorï¿½ host now refuses to refer to him by name as he insults him. Essentially, there are many people around this country who still watch Fox News, yet instead of being accepted as a simple alternative to the other hyperactive cable networks, it is now a powerful, long-running joke. In fact, Olbermann has already pointed out that The Half-Hour News Hour is particularly unnecessary when the channel that spawned it is an endless supply of comedy on its own. But, spawn it they have, and now we are here to judge it as harshly as it deserves.,Some of the intrepid souls that helped to create and research Outfoxed continue to sacrifice their free time to watch Fox News and point out its myriad inaccuracies and outrageous moments on their website, NewsHounds. They split their duties amongst the Channelï¿½s shows, and although they are generally accustomed to Foxï¿½s unsavory behavior, they still occasionally become outraged by what they see on their screens. Accordingly, Deborah Yesner, who has been suffering through The Half-Hour News Hour since its premiere, describes the show as what would happen if ï¿½Mike Gallagher and Mike Savage had a few drinks and wrote down their favorite one-liners.ï¿½,Indeed, The Half-Hour News Hour is not a clever response to The Daily Show, or a clever anything at all. In addition to its cheap, mean-spirited humor, the show actually features a boisterous, obnoxious laugh track, a tactic that, devoid of irony, hasnï¿½t worked since the middle seasons of Seinfeld. Yet, though it does feature several (unknown) actors ï¿½ who I donï¿½t blame for accepting a paycheck ï¿½ The Half-Hour News Hour is not, in its own mind at least, a sitcom. ,The man and woman who anchor the show fluctuate between smug and smugger, and whenever the recorded laughter plays, they revel in their false adulation. And then thereï¿½s the humor, which is not onlyï¿½ not humorous, but quite specifically blunt and mean. Whether it was the giant, fake guffaw after describing Hillaryï¿½s potential cabinet as ï¿½angry lesbians,ï¿½ or turning James and the Giant Peach into James and the Giant Melanoma ï¿½ as Yesner wrote on NewsHounds, ï¿½Iï¿½m sure John McCain found that hilariousï¿½ ï¿½ their obsession with cruelty supersedes even their lack of wit as the main reason why the show is such a failure. If this were South Park slamming Cruise and Travolta, then the cruelty would be warranted, appreciated, and celebrated, but the show is not written by people with a sliver of the talent of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Comedy, and satire in particular, can be at its best when not playing nice, but when the bullying nature of Oï¿½Reilly and Hannity is your only method of attempting to induce laughter, then you most certainly have not succeeded.,In her comments about the show, Yesner wrote, ï¿½I don’t think the writers really understand comedy. They crossed that line and the anger and cruelty came through. That’s never really funny to anyone except the bullies.ï¿½ Just as schoolyard terrors tend to take out their rage on others due to deep-seated insecurity, the showï¿½s laugh track suggests that the even people behind The Half-Hour News Hour are uncertain of their productï¿½s viability. ï¿½In the very last scene which was added on,ï¿½ Yesner explained, ï¿½they showed an audience to convince the fans that it was all really hilarious.ï¿½ Well, at least theyï¿½re self-aware.,As depressing as the very existence of The Half-Hour News Hour is, its importance pales in comparison to a parallel development. Although Yesner is certainly correct in stating that Fox is ï¿½afraid of [Stewart's and Colbertï¿½s] influence and ratings,ï¿½ a look at Comedy Centralï¿½s 11 oï¿½clock programming makes one wish for the heady days of 2004. The Colbert Report continues to grow in stature, staging guitar-playing contests between its host and The Decemberists, but the focal point of the past decadeï¿½s fake news has been left for dead with a barely-there Samantha Bee and the PC guy from those cutesy Mac commercials. Jon Stewart can still squeeze laughs out of the look on his face after showing a particularly well-selected clip, but, funny though it might be, The Daily Show rarely inspires the passion it once did. A recent Laguna Beach parody recalled the top-notch humor of the show in past years; in its sly way, it angrily criticized the vapid entertainment provided by MTVï¿½s cottage industry of ï¿½realï¿½ pretty-white-people shows. This was a reminder of the program that has gradually slipped away from us as its various correspondents have gone on to successful careers away from ï¿½fakeï¿½ news. ,What made The Daily Show so valuable was that, although it is not ï¿½real news,ï¿½ it always felt more honest, and certainly more intelligent, than what we had come to accept as the norm in televised journalism. Though it was somewhat juvenile in the Lewinsky days, it grew into a nightly expression of the frustration and resentment its audience felt towards the information with which they were presented. One doubts that Tim Russert would have eviscerated ï¿½pro-familyï¿½ man Bill Bennett with the efficiency and eloquence that Jon Stewart once did. And to see Stewartï¿½s show slide into a still-amusing but relatively toothless comfort zone is harder to swallow than any of the jokes on The Half-Hour News Hour.,Whereas the decline of The Daily Show is certainly visible, it is nonetheless quite subtle compared to the mix of cruelty and desperation on display in The Half-Hour News Hour. Indeed, as Yesner points out, ï¿½FOX is accustomed to shoving stuff down their viewersï¿½ throats.ï¿½ But, unintentionally hilarious though the Channel might be, its bluntness had previously been channeled into shows that take themselves quite seriously. In doing so with what is supposed to be comedy, the suits at FNC are showing a degree of vulnerability to which they would never otherwise admit. Although we are slowly losing The Daily Show as a vital outlet for our frustration, the existence and botched execution of The Half-Hour News Hour suggests that we might eventually lose Fox News as televisionï¿½s loudest landfill.,Yesner agrees, to a point: ï¿½I say they’re doomed but don’t see it yet. However, it’s possible that they’ll try a Coulter/Limbaugh shift, making political attacks viler while increasing their tabloid focus.ï¿½ So, The Half-Hour News Hour might not actually signal the beginning of the end, but a transition into an even more unpleasant state. As unfortunate as that might seem on its surface, there is always the chance that the increase in cruelty might actually invigorate Stewart and his team, and give us back the show that attacked the world around it with a passion and intelligence so particularly rare in todayï¿½s television. One can dream about The Daily Showï¿½s return to form, but, for now, we can all hope that The Half-Hour News Hour will vanish as quickly as possible.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_rise_of_cruelty_and_decline_of_wit/,"

"There’s a man claiming to have seen a giant squid. He says it came up close to the edge of the bay, swimming in T-waves, and shaking a little bit. He says it probably would have eaten him alive, but that he got away just in time. By his account, the squid was purple and looked like a cucumber with too many legs. ,	My roommate Yongjiu sees the story on the 6 o’clock news. When he tells me about it, I start to think that maybe the guy was me. The way I remember it though, the squid was a dark red, almost a maroon, and it didn’t look at all like a cucumber. A tuba, if anything. ,	I’m not sure why, but it’s something I’ve been doing ever since I moved to California a few months ago. Mostly it’s a question of inflection, but not entirely. I import meanings that weren’t there, make things sound prettier than they are. I find a small reassurance in this manipulation. Just the other day, I named all my neighbors after my favorite verbs. Now, when the couple down the hall is up fighting until 4 a.m., instead of getting angry, I say to myself something like, ‘Oh that crazy Pirouette family, always up to something.’,	I call Rebecca three times this week and none of the times she picks up. I tell myself it’s because she’s at work, and she’s so busy these days. She would stop if she could, I think, but she’s planning a trip to the moon and there’s been hold-up. Fuss over the ozone, broken space heaters. ,*** 	,	Later that night at the deli, I bump into Pickle Boy. The deli is halfway across town from me, on the corner of F Street and Covell. It’s open all night, run by a short orthodox Jew who has bright orange hair and whose name is Nick. You can get anything there. Hot sandwiches, soup, or even puzzle glue. It’s the kind of place that feels like a strange little drawer in the big chest of the city, one that opens when you come and shuts when you go. ,	I’m here tonight because I can’t sleep again, and I told myself that whenever this happened, I was going to do something productive, something like shopping, or laundry, or clipping my toenails. I’m picking through the avocadoes trying to figure out how soft is ripe and how soft is rotten when Pickle Boy taps me on the arm. ,	“Pickle Boy? Is that you?” ,	“I haven’t heard that name in forever,” he says. ,	I ask him what he’s doing in California and he tells me that he lives out here now. We’re both from Aspinwall, a small town just outside of Pittsburgh. ,	 “I moved west about five years ago,” he says. “I ended up in San Francisco after high school and came to Davis a couple years ago.”,	I say something about how this is so wild, this is so crazy, look at us, bumping into each other like this, in a deli in the middle of the night. We could have missed each other completely. He says something too, something like wow, isn’t it? It really is. I haven’t seen him since I was a little kid, but I want to tell him about this monster squid – to rally him, to shake the blanket from his eyes. Pickle Boy, I want to say, you’re blinded now, but you better look up. Double-knot your laces, he’s coming, and you and I, we need to get going quick.,***,	Pickle Boy is the kind of person you don’t think about until you’re forced to, until you bump into him ten years later over too-soft avocadoes. His mom and dad were both retarded and neither of them had a job. Instead, they walked up and down our street, back and forth from their house to the bar that all the Vietnam vets in the neighborhood went to for whiskey shots in the middle of the day. His mom always walked with plastic grocery bags cupped in her arms. I don’t know what she carried in them, but she carried them the same way you’d picture somebody carrying something they were trying to save, pushed up against her chest like a nest of baby birds. ,	When we were about ten, something happened to confirm all of our suspicions. Pickle Boy’s dad ran out of his house naked and chased Pickle Boy all the way down the street. He was wearing nothing but socks, beating a wooden spoon against the bottom of an old saucepan. His belly jiggled like cooking grease with each bounce down the hill.,	A little while later, we heard that Pickle Boy was really taken care of by his grandmother. This didn’t surprise us. She was an old woman we knew that fed peanuts to squirrels and passed out toothbrushes and dental hygiene pamphlets on Halloween. It was decided that Pickle Boy was an alien, a transient, and unintelligible life form. ,	Right around the time my parents were getting a divorce, Pickle Boy and I started walking down to the fire station almost every day. It was three blocks from my house and four from his. We’d stand outside the big glass window staring at the trucks for hours. They were impeccable. Ladders that hung off the side doors, hoses that coiled like thick iron horseshoes, and heavy lights mounted to the front, lights I was sure could kill a man if he looked straight into them. Pickle Boy and I were entranced. We pressed our noses up against the glass and made fish lips onto the window, little oohms and collective sighs. ,	We’d go back up the street and it would be back to normal. Pickle Boy would be Pickle Boy, and I would run and take my place on Susie Anderson’s porch and make fun of him with all the others from a distance. ,	When I bump into him in the grocery store, Pickle Boy asks me what I’m doing in California, Davis of all places. I tell him that honestly, I’m not quite sure. ,***,	Pickle Boy invites me to his apartment and I go over a couple nights later. There’s a girl on the porch with him who has the look of being blissfully roped up in something. I can tell that she is ready to ride away into the dusk with Pickle Boy and I can’t believe it. She keeps toying with his belt and reaching for his hand. Maybe she does not want to go anywhere unless it is with Pickle Boy, I think. Maybe she cooks him breakfast every morning. Maybe she can’t imagine life without him. He probably likes his eggs scrambled, with a little bit of water, but she probably makes them with a little bit of milk, and this is something they argue about, jokingly. He probably grabs her from behind, and playfully kisses her on the cheek.,	Pickle Boy’s girlfriend knows exactly what I’m talking about when I bring up the monster squid later on, as we’re sitting on the porch watching the sun go down over the Coastal ranges. She’s with me on this one. ,	We agree that there’s no way this nobody saw one. No good. We want footage. Still no good, but at least a little bit better. If he was so close to land, why didn’t he do something about it, grab the authorities before it went away or tackle it? Better to go down fighting at such a moment in one’s life than to do nothing at all. Guy goes to a beach, doesn’t see a sea monster, somebody tell me that story, I say. I’m getting worked up and she is too. She says that if it’s as easy as that, she’ll claim to have seen one too. We plan it out. She’ll curl her hair for the newscast. ,	She’s been reading a lot about them though, these monster squids. They’re taller than full-grown men, she says, and can jet about the water like engines, squeezing their bodies together in enormous contractions and pushing out the water like giant mutant babies from a womb. They have eyes the size of basketballs. These squids, she says, before this guy, no one had ever seen one alive, but she’s heard that they can eat just about anything, take it between their beak-like jaws, poison it, and then crush it to death. ,	 The three of us sit on Pickle Boy’s porch underneath the shade of the walnut tree until night falls completely. Pickle Boy and I play guitar, and all three of us drink beers, sweating dinner into the still dry air. We decide that if anyone gets this squid, it will be us. I tell them it’s maybe better not to go in with any plan, as underdogs. Let’s think ahead of time that it won’t be easy, I say.,	When I left her, I told Rebecca a lot of the same things. She had just cheated on me, and couldn’t look me in the eyes anymore, but I didn’t care to look at her either. I told her something about how I saw breaking up from afar. It’s glowing and seething, I said, round in the middle like the belly of a balloon. I didn’t know what that all meant. I just knew that when I was saying it, my lips felt orange and silly and that I wanted to hurt her in the same way she’d hurt me. I wanted her to picture me in bed with other people, doing that thing she does with her tongue and kicking a foot out over the covers to cool off one leg. It was her move, now it’s mine; sorry if you didn’t know I was taking it with me, I still want to be friends of course. When the plane first landed in California, I felt like I was walking off of a plank. All my toes went numb in chorus, started screaming muffled Hallelujahs through the blanket of my socks.,***,	I’m sitting on the couch one night watching Yongjiu do a diving flip into the wall, this thing he does for exercise. He kicks his feet up behind him and props them on the plaster and he can stand like this on his hands for nearly thirty minutes. Of all places, I think, the last place to find one of these monster squids is Davis.,	If I’m going to find it I’ve got to go to the coast. There’s no way that thing will make it to Davis alive. Even if the squid did wash up in the bay, swirl around a bit and push up over the mountains into the bowl of the Central Valley, it would curl up and die in the stagnant heat, just like the palm trees and everything else. Things have been so busy, but when I find the time, this won’t be an issue. I’ll seek it to the coast and further. Whereas it’s only got these messy, ridiculous arms, with suckers that drag in the viscous water, I’ve got legs that can run through smooth vacuums of terrestrial air. My legs can skip and jump and kick. I’ll sneak up on it. Turn my kneecaps in a little and walk softly, breathe out the side of my mouth. I can be incredibly quiet, quieter than 10,000 mice in hibernation. ,	The squid doesn’t know it yet, but I’ve acquired superpowers, and I’ve been practicing. When I stumble in drunk late at night now, I don’t bother with the lights. I see straight through the dark, crawl into bed without stubbing a toe, and wake up without the slightest of hangovers. Hey Rebecca, I say to my pillow, what now?,***,	Pickle Boy and I are playing soccer in the park when he asks me how he got the nickname. ,	I remember it pretty well and can’t believe he forgets it. It was maybe when we were about ten, at the end of a long summer. A kid in our neighborhood named Chono Xavier and his older sister Marta held a clothing drive. Chono and Marta were Mexican by descent and they told us that the clothing drive was for a mudslide in the village they grew up in. We wanted to believe them, but we all knew that it was a sham. None of us doubted that they actually sent away some of the clothes, but we knew that they picked through them first and kept what they wanted for themselves. When they had held a clothing drive for hurricane relief the year before, my sister gave Marta her favorite sweater to give away, bright red with special knitting at the base of the sleeves. Winter came, and Marta wore the sweater to school almost everyday.,	Pickle Boy had no idea though. He collected cans every day for a couple weeks, cashed them in and then took all the money to a Red and Blue down the street. He bought as much as he could with what he had. He gave everything to Chono except one shirt he had found, a Heinz variety shirt with a bright green cartoon pickle on it, curved above the insignia and sitting sideways like an ugly beret. He started wearing it all the time. That’s how he got the nickname. I don’t remember who exactly started it, maybe a boy named Pierce Fraunheim, but when he did get it, the name stuck. The worst part was, Pickle Boy had no idea. He wore the nickname like a crown. ,	I can tell by the way he asks me, squinting his eyes in a way that’s sort of half-pained and half-joking that he’s long since figured it out. I tell him I have no idea how it came about. It must have been one of those stupid kid things, I say. You know how those go.,***,	I talked to her today. I finally got through. I had told myself I wouldn’t do this anymore, but I got lonely the other day and remembered how we decided that if we ever had kids, we’d mess them up from the get-go, name them after planets, Jupiter Mars and Saturn Pluto. Can you imagine what the principals would say, she asked me? The soccer coaches? The idea was that you’d put a dent in them early on, like you would with a brand-new car so that you’re not afraid of crashing it every time you drive around the block. I call her at work. ,	“Rebecca?”,	“Yes?”,	“It’s me.”,	“Chris?”,	“Yes.”,	There is a long pause, where she doesn’t say anything, and I don’t say anything. We’re both waiting for the other person to take the lead on this one. I know she’s curling her mouth to one side, and biting on the inside of her lip. She does this whenever she’s impatient, or really tired, or whenever we’ve talked since we’ve broken up.,	“Chris…” she says, eventually. “What do you want?”,	“I just thought we could talk.”,	She doesn’t say anything, so I go on.,	“I miss you, Rebecca.”,	She’s biting her lip now, I can sense the change over the line. She’s ready to go out on a limb. She’s ready to fly back six months.,	“Well, maybe it was right,” she says. “Maybe it never should have ended, if it still hurts.” I watch the words come out through the mouth of the phone and drop to the ground, leaden and writhing. I know she means them, and it feels wonderful. I don’t say anything. ,	“Chris,” she says, and I can see it coming. She’s still absolutely mine. “I love you.”,	On this, I hang up.,	It scares me that she’s going away completely. Every time I look up, she’s a little further away. As much as I don’t want to be with her, the most awful side of me needs her to need me. She had perfect lips and bugged her eyes out at all the good parts of stories. ,***,	I’m sitting at Pickle Boy’s that night, and we’re playing video games. We’re playing that old Sonic game where after you kill Doctor Robotnik at the end of a level, you release thousands of tiny bunny rabbits and squirrels from the Doctor’s spaceship. I’ve just saved every last rodent in the galaxy, and I’m watching them fill up the screen, bouncing and springing in beautiful synchronization, when Pickle Boy turns to me. ,	 “Now would be the time,” he says. ,	It’s almost October and he’s absolutely right. If this squid is still around, it won’t be for long. Winter is coming, and soon it will be gone, deeper into the ocean, off to mate and create new giant squids. By the time next year comes, even if Pickle Boy and I are still here, the squids will be unstoppable. If we’re going to do this, it’s got to be now.,	The night is spread out like a table before us, and my hands are all palm as I drive, curling around the leather of the wheel and shaking. The road is relatively empty. We listen to pop music and to Spanish DJs that make everything sound urgent and incredible by emphasizing alternating syllables. ,	 The funny thing about driving through California is that so much of it is farm land. It is fields of rice and wheat, acre after acre of orchards and soybeans, crop upon crop going straight into the mouth of a cow. At night though, it’s too dark for all of this and only the foggy sky is left, flanking the road like a pretty set of handmade curtains. We reach the coast at 4 a.m., turn into a patch of beach pressed right up against the mouth of the bay and shut off the car.,	The squid is there waiting for us when we arrive. I knew he would be. It makes me angry to say it, but the guy on the news was right – the squid is a dark, almost unforgivable shade of purple. ,	I grapple with the moment. There are so many things I’ve been waiting to do. I want to hoist the squid above my head, and dig my fingertips into its belly like little needles, pinch it, and make it squirm. Then, I want to take the tentacles and braid them, pull them up into a tight, painful ballerina’s knot on the top of the squid’s head. If they are braided, I decide, the squid cannot use them to maim and destroy and to break people’s hearts.,	Pickle Boy and his girlfriend are seated on the wet sand as I approach the water, his arms wrapped loosely around her body and holding her close. ,	The battle is quick. I dive into the ocean and let my head go under. The squid pushes at me with one furious arm, and I let it sink my head into the warm ocean mud. It feels wonderful to be so submerged but after a moment I pop back out the water. I flip the squid down on his back and press him against the ocean, dig my fist into his side.,	Instead of screaming like he’s supposed to though, he’s moaning. He’s turning blue; I’ve hurt him. Now is my moment to hoist and declare, to braid and capture and celebrate, I win, you lose, didn’t you know this would happen when you did the things you did squid, but there are tears coming out of his great molluscan eyes and dripping down his soft body. ,	I let him be, relinquish my grip. His eyes are streaming now. I wonder where his mother is. Pickle Boy’s standing up now, but I tell him that I’m going to fix the squid, that I’ve changed my mind.,	 I kneel down in the sand and lean over him, pressing my lips softly to the squid’s eyelids. I pull the tears into my mouth, cupping my hands into a straw, and then moving to release them onto the open surface of the wound. I’m working faster after a bit, sucking up greedy cheekfuls, and pushing them onto the wound like a bath. ,	“Jesus Christ,” says Pickle Boy after awhile. “Pick him up, throw him back in.”,	I step back, and wipe the tears from my face, a mixture of his and mine. I’m crying too now, purple molluscan tears. ,	“He’s fine,” Pickle Boy says. “He’s fine. Just throw him in.”,	The wound is healed completely by this point. I lift him from the bottom and push him back out to sea on the surface of the water, watch as he ducks under and swims away. ,	The sun rises just as we’re getting back on the freeway. Pickle Boy and his girlfriend are in the front, and I’m in the back. I’m feeling a little bit sleepy and facing forwards into the day, counting out imaginary palm trees as they pass by my window. I think about how when I was younger, I used to play this game whenever I rode in cars. You pull your chin up over the top of one distant tree and duck it back down under the next.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_car_tree_game/,"

"Television is the opiate of the masses. Surfing channels these days, we see the screen jump from images of skinny models bickering, to bedraggled people on a desert island, to co-eds living together as they have been for the past ten years. They don’t call it a guilty pleasure for nothing.,At first, the shiny interior of Mode magazine, the fictional landscape of Ugly Betty, fits into the model of the stereotypical television show. Chrome and without angles, bathed in a blue palette, it creates the perfect atmosphere of calm and cool. Spaceship-like, it is alien and soulless – haute-couture at its loftiest.,Then in walks Betty.,The title character, Betty Suarez, is laughingly out of place at Mode. Clearly not a size two—sporting both adult braces and glasses, and covered in a rainbow poncho—she wears her personality on her sleeve. While we expect her role in the television show to be significant, little does the audience anticipate her importance to the magazine. It turns out, Ugly Betty is anything but bête.,The story goes mostly like this: Betty is foisted upon Mode editor-in-chief, Daniel Meade, by his father in hopes that her unattractiveness will keep him in line. Despite open hostility from day one – “I just found my new screensaver,” quips another assistant after taking Betty’s photo – she quickly proves her worth with a few brilliant saves in times of distress.,The unconventional fish out of water story is what most critics and fans are raving about. By now, you’ve probably heard of this show if only because it immediately precedes Grey’s Anatomy on Thursdays. It’s also known as the spin-off of Yo Soy Betty La Fea, a Colombian telenovela that’s already been exported to several European countries.,“Ugly is the new beautiful,” rings ABC’s slogan to promote the show. The Washington Post perhaps most accurately summed up its theme: “Mostly, it’s getting even with anyone who ever rejected your proposal of lunch, dinner, a movie or marriage because they thought you weren’t good enough.” New York Magazine praised the show for its smart, satirical analysis of the fashion industry, remarking that “Ugly Betty flourishes because of its well-calibrated tone: the borderline-ludicrous haute outfits of her preening co-workers, who look as if they’ve stumbled off a David LaChapelle photo shoot.” Entertainment Weekly went as far as to call the show revolutionary for its daring to make a character as unattractive as Betty Suarez its title character. ,Now, six months later with two Golden Globes under its belt and high Nielsen ratings, Ugly Betty seems like it has fulfilled its prophecy of the show that is bringing ugly back. But does this mean that this television show is revolutionary? In a word: no.,The themes that earn Ugly Betty praise also make up its biggest weaknesses, because with them, the show risks becoming trite and corny. There are already plenty of shows that devote themselves to preaching about the importance of family, including some that are not recently cancelled shows about families of seven. (Yes, Gilmore Girls still plods along.) There are also plenty of shows about being true to yourself, most of which ostensibly target the under-seven set. ,Even Ugly Betty’s setting is unoriginal. Producers, hoping to ride the wave of The Devil Wears Prada’s success, launched dramas and reality shows about the world of fashion, including Bo Derek’s Fashion House, which lasted a total of three months.  ,Nonetheless, Ugly Betty is still fresh, not for its revelation that it is what’s on the inside that matters, but for its often overlooked exploration of uncomfortable subjects. For starters, there are all the usual problems that prevent domestic tranquility in television dramas: alcoholism amongst the rich and single motherhood amongst the less well-off. Then there are the real shockers. ,There’s Betty’s adolescent nephew, Justin. His hobbies include making “jazz hands,” commenting on Betty’s fashion sense, and performing the opening act of Hairspray in a stalled subway car. Television audiences have long been ready for storylines about gay people, but a gay eleven year old? Also in Betty’s family is her father, Ignacio. He surprises his family and the audience when he announces that he fled to America after murdering his late wife’s ex-husband. But we love him so much by this point that he’s easily forgiven. Most surprising is the recent development that Daniel Meade’s “dead” brother, Alex, is actually alive. Alex is also now Daniel’s sister. ,But neither the touchy-feely Betty nor the hip, subversive Betty is the biggest draw of audiences. The show’s addictive qualities stem from voyeuristic peek into two unknown worlds simultaneously. ,Let’s not kid ourselves. The little part of us that revels in schadenfreude perks up when Betty shows up to the holiday party in a sweatshirt replete with miniature light bulbs. As much as we enjoy Betty’s family life, we like sneaking into a household with a real live illegal immigrant even more. And surprise – he’s just like any other TV dad, supportive and proud. ,Scores of fan-sites focus on the actors and actresses, not the show itself. The story of America Ferrera, the actress who plays Betty, mirrors that of her character in the sense that she is not a size zero in a size-zero industry, Ferrera is unmistakably beautiful beneath the fake eyebrows and braces. Meanwhile, the rest of the cast includes some famous names like Vanessa Williams and Allen Dale of OC renown. Shorter stints with Selma Hayek and Lucy Liu clearly attract audiences on star power alone. Talk of characters and the plot dominate forums. One discussion on  HYPERLINK “http://www.uglybetty-tv.com” www.uglybetty-tv.com asks the question, “OK…so who do YOU want betty to be with?” ,Others still watch for the fashion. A recent New York Times article reports the popularity of Gucci’s 85th anniversary bag thanks to Ugly Betty’s launch pad. ,When settling down for a restful evening near the end of the week, issues of class, race, and gender inequality are the furthest thing from the average American’s mind. ,This isn’t to say that Ugly Betty has failed in its intentions or has low ambitions. Rather, its genius lies in exposing the audience to something without their knowledge. Most, while watching for the laughs or fashions, also become acclimated to people normally left out of television – the fashion-challenged, the transgender, and the illegal immigrant. ,In any case, Ugly Betty has certainly fulfilled its duty to Disney stockholders. It is one of the most successful new shows of the 2006-2007 season. As a result, Ugly Betty does have the ability to revolutionize television in its tackling of hush-hush issues. Right now, the show’s producers have left themselves much leeway. They have a choice between making Ugly Betty a dramedy about an ugly duckling that leaves issues of race and class in the subtext or making some of the serious discussions a larger part of the television show. ,While the latter choice would be truly revolutionary, it also requires a clear message, which Ugly Betty’s makers clearly haven’t figured out yet. At this point, a motley cast of characters are all linked through their relationship with Betty, but to what purpose? No risks are being taken if Justin goes through life blithely unaware of his uniqueness minus a few small incidences. And why is no one questioning sister Alex’s mental state in her new form and only inquiring into her betrayal of the family by faking her death? Is America ultimately a melting pot where people of all types become one, or is it a salad bowl where people can remain their own entities? It seems as though the producers are testing the waters before they answer those questions. ,On the one hand, this is wise. After all, ABC needs to sell to a wider audience. Truly revolutionary shows like HBO’s The Wire, set in the ghettos of West Baltimore, can only see success on a small scale because HBO’s audience is much more self-selective than ABC’s. On the other hand, there isn’t much time left for Ugly Betty to decide on a course of action. Although the plot has not slowed nor have the quips stopped firing, the show is starting to recycle itself. Grace Chin, Lucy Liu’s character introduced in the latest episode, for example, is disturbingly similar to Selma Hayek’s character earlier in the season. Both are man eaters who sleep with Daniel to manipulate him. ,We can only hope that Ugly Betty does not go the way of Desperate Housewives or The OC. Both of these shows started out with a class-based premise. Upper middle class women in picture-perfect towns can be oppressed; the existence of liberal hypocrisy in the wealthy of liberal California. It is to be hoped that the makers of Ugly Betty – which include Selma Hayek – are simply biding their time before bringing these class issues to the forefront of the show. Perhaps the safest bet is to wait and woo audiences first with the glitz and glamor. After all, revolution happens one step at a time.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/ugly_betty_revolution_or_repackaging/,"

"It has been two days since we declared war on the relationship between Joe and his girlfriend, and the battle is going well. The war began as a collective decision.,  A need to do something had been growing within Hal, Charlie, and me since the first fumbling public make out session, they on the couch and the three of us trying to concentrate on “Donnie Darko”.  All the elements came together after dinner one night, when Joe and Mindy stepped out to catch a romantic comedy at the corner theater.  Hal turned to Charlie and me as soon as they were out the door and, in a tone that signified a matter of national security, said that something must be done.  We knew exactly what he was talking about, and agreed.  How could we not? Joe’s girlfriend is Mindy.  She earns four hundred dollars a day working for herself out of a tiny office on Sixth Street.  People —men, women, all ages, all creeds— hire her to talk to them about their problems and then cook them a hot meal.  There is no name in the yellow pages.  Just a number in bold, with a box around it.  As a rule, advertising is superfluous. The people who need her find her.  It’s the kind of niche job that exists only in the most desperate of cities, and that would sap anyone of all cloying sentimentality for fellow human beings.  At this point in her life, Mindy was pretty much bone dry.  While she cared a great deal about the concept of “humanity” as a whole, individuals did not matter too much. Joe, however, got her attention.  She met him in a bar, a place where the four of us had met so many women, and took him home.  Hal, Charlie, and I hadn’t expected it to last.  We know all of our track records, lists of broken hearts and one night stands.  We did not and do not know exactly what they said to each other while sipping on beer and chewing stale peanuts, but we know what Joe’s standard angle of attack is.  And given that she was providing for Joe essentially the same service she gave anybody with ready cash… we told each other it would be a long time before a cold day in hell, and waited.  This was our greatest mistake, trusting in the evidence of old relationships. For work, Mindy wears fishnets and a short skirt, as well as a t-shirt that is slightly too loose.  She says that it does the trick for her clients.  It certainly did for Joe, who started walking her to work three days of the week.  At home, she favors baggy sweatshirts and panties.  Joe wears his standard jeans and t-shirt, and they sit on the couch watching reruns of Warner Brothers cartoons and The Simpsons.  One night when I got home late, I found them seated on the couch with the TV blaring.  They were both asleep —not in each others’ arms, but with one pair of palms layered and one pair gripped between them.  I turned the TV off and left them.  It is the one picture of their relationship that has any value.,Hal, Charlie, Joe and I share an apartment.  It’s the only way to live in the city and we have plenty of space.  We moved in together after college, in that period when everyone was trying to figure out whether they would follow their dreams or get jobs that would actually make money.  Since the first day, we held ourselves to certain duties. Every wednesday was frisbee night, every thursday movie night, and every friday was whatever we felt like doing that was outside of the apartment.  It was a good routine.,Mindy had no free time routine in her life when she met Joe, and soon we found her borrowing ours, making our nights hers.  The process began two days after their third date, when she did not move in to our place but began spending the night on a regular basis.  We found that for someone who had previously done little, her plans were epic in scope.  She organized board games in the park, trips to monuments and museums, picnics in centralized public locations and other things. Most notable among them were faux-impromptu literary discussions on museum steps.  I always felt shady when involved in this last game, as if I was degrading all the people who actually did spontaneously burst out into analysis of Moby Dick and Paradise Lost.  Spectacle and presentation are Mindy’s arts, and she likes to make us props and characters in the virtual image of life that she creates for the city’s benefit.  She explained to me that her goal was to make people believe the real world functioned like a movie or book, with characters who were actually interesting and extraordinary events occurring on a regular basis.  It seems a generous idea, but I know that no one besides small children with too much time on their hands pay us any mind.,There was no way to tell Mindy or Joe that we wanted out of this new routine, that this was too much of a change from our old tricks, so our old life disappeared extremely quickly.  That was one of our complaints, being swept up in things.  Our world’s natural speed was slow; we took every day easy.  This was an instinctive understanding we had always possessed, as had Joe.  Mindy’s ideas, and Joe’s willingness to go along with them, seemed a fundamental contract violation.,Our other grievances range across a thousand things, from the way she brushes her hair to her devotion to cats and small children that have no connection to her.  The most important reason for our war, however, was best verbalized by Charlie.  “The coupling sullies us,” he said, “with its wholesomeness.”  And it’s true.  They are a textbook couple. To see Joe is to know that Mindy is near.  When they walk down the street, they send a subtle message of unintentional contempt to every single person out there, at the same time demonstrating how easy it is to find a perfect relationship, and demanding an explanation for how you yourself haven’t been as lucky.  There is no room outside of their circle for anyone else. “And what sort of circle has only two points, anyway?”  That piece of wit was my small corollary to Charlie’s comment, a flippant note that we could snicker at.  I made it secretly as a personal shield against Joe and Mindy, and anyone who fell asleep holding someone’s hand while watching television.  Like so many famous people before me, I know that cynicism is my only defense.  I didn’t explain my comment to Hal and Charlie.  They would have most likely taken exception at my attempts to lump their innermost motivations for ending the relationship with my own.,To destroy a knot, make one part of the rope feel guilty for being bound.  Hal explained the theory, and Charlie and I agreed that it was good.  This is possibly because we are romantics and cowards, and hate to take the easy path when a more winding road is available.  Joe, Charlie, Hal, and I each have a thousand tasks to do around the apartment, and we share and split them anew each week.  And so, to kill Joe and Mindy’s ties, we allow their romance to flourish at our own expense. None of us remind Joe that he has to do this or that job—we just take care of it ourselves and make sure that he sees the evidence.  There is no need to wonder where he was instead of at the task —of course he was with her.  I paraded past him yesterday carrying the three rolls of wallpaper for the bathroom that he had forgotten to pick up.  Charlie cooked up a lavish feast for breakfast this morning, when Joe had been slated to heat up some pop tarts and put on the coffee.  In this way, the three of us are digging our claws into him and reminding him of the value that we put on him. Joe has not fully come to grips with what is happening, and I do not think that he will ever manage to do so.  He is only certain that everyone is being nice to him, “making time for him”.  This seems to be working, but if he is as thick as we suspect, it may take him some time.  We have councils whenever possible, a trio of anti-Yentas planning how next to make our discomfort felt.,Mindy, we think, has realized what we are up to and sees the writing on the wall.  She knows what is coming and how the three of us are working against her. Whenever she catches us without Joe present she snaps, while we act shocked and promise her time alone with her boyfriend so that she can mellow out.  Hal confided that, “It is telling that she is more afraid for the relationship than Joe.  She was always smarter than him, and won’t stay where unwanted.”  I concur.  It may be just two days so far, but we have no fear.  Our cause is noble and our purpose just, so we shall not be defeated.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/a_mindy_city/,"

"What are the elements of a group’s sound?  If you listened to all the records by the Postal Service, you’d think that the unifying force was spastic electronic beats  and Ben Gibbard’s dulcet tones.  If you listened to every Radiohead song, you’d know that success is defined by an operatic wail and intense production.,If you chose instead to consider LCD Soundsystem’s music, you’d understand that success is based on using a rather nasal voice to moan-talk about semi-random stuff over minimal drum and drum-machine combinations that build to a dance music frenzy.  For many of the tracks on their debut, this combination is enough to hold things together.  Every track isn’t a gem, but there’s enough groove and diversity here to ensure that your hipster friends will be able to dance at your next party without feeling like they’ve sold out.,The LCDS formula was established when producer James Murphy used the band name to release the single “Losing My Edge.”  “Losing My Edge” starts with a sparse drum machine beat over which an aging indie rock lover complains about falling behind the curve, boiling into a climax of synths as Murphy rants off the names of bands that he admires.  It works extremely well; who could object to the self-parody of a lyric like “I hear that everyone you know /  is more relevant / than everyone I know”?  ,Murphy released six other singles over the past year, and built up a large cult following eager for the inevitable album, the self-titled LCD Soundsystem (Now on tour, the live show features Murphy on vocals, Pat Mahoney on drums, Nancy Whang on keyboard and backing vocals, Tyler Pope on bass, and Phil Mossman on guitar.  If Murphy’s moan wasn’t the unifying element, and he hadn’t written all of the tracks, one would think he might be marginalizing himself).  LCDS has cleverly decided to bundle a second disc of all seven singles with the album, so that anyone who hasn’t had the benefit of listening to the old tracks will get a chance.  How does this combination work? First, the album:,The problem with sticking to a form is that it can get dull, and the soul of good house/dance music is having just enough variety to make the tracks seem new without actually changing.  The problem with LCDS, though, is that they haven’t yet grasped this.  While there are standouts (notably “Daft Punk Is Playing At My House” and the ridiculous beats of “Disco Infiltrator”), the basic Murphy monologue and regular beat-and-build-up means that several tracks on the CD -no matter how decent they would be as singles- come across strictly as filler.  And “Too Much Love,” the worst of these, is a composition no indie-rocker should have to endure.,Indeed, LCDS are at their best when breaking out of established form.  “Tribulations” sounds much more like classic house music than their other work.  Although the song might be able to get DJ Bob’s approval, it has numerous dark overtones thrown in that make the piece feel fresh.  “Never As Tired As When I’m Waking Up” borrows the baseline and guitar solo from “Dear Prudence” by the Beatles to make a dreamy, downer up-at-3-a.m. piece of psychedelia that is my favorite track.  And “Great Release” is the ambient-pop track (deceptively starting with a quick drum machine beat but then restraining the sound with immense piano chords) that would close down any club and send the crowd into the night in a happy haze.,The album is well made, but stagnates because of the repetition.  And how about that singles disc?  The short answer is that there is nothing bad to report.   The CD is the perfect sweet to complement any and all of the album’s sour.  “Give It Up” is pure drum-bass-and-synth-driven funk, and “Losing My Edge” remains priceless. (Again, the lyrics! “I’ve never been wrong /  I used to work in a record store.”)  The “Pretentious Mix” of “Yeah” sounds like Medeski, Martin, and Wood with a dance beat, the “Crass Version” like people saying “Yeah” over and over again while morphing into a pile-up of synths and drum machines.  ,Because each track was cut as a single, the sound is considerably more diverse than that of the album itself, giving the listener everything they were missing.  In sum, then, this whole package is a fairly diverse collection of music to grind to, along with a few exceptional and terrible outliers, all tied together by bizarre nasal monologues and drum beats.  As a piece of indie-rock ephemera, LCDS’ debut album is not great art – don’t expect it to last.  But if you want some music to dance to and want your friends assume that you’re cutting edge, it’s definitely worth checking out.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/lcd_soundsystem_by_lcd_sound_system/,"

"Hype is an interesting phenomenon. Advertisers try to create it. Any product, ranging from an eight-dollar movie ticket to the five-bladed razor, hopes to have it. And, in the artistic world, there is the constant fear of backlash, that this album or this film will not live up to the towers of press releases and hours of advertising, resulting in a gigantic consumer backlash and the inevitable ruination of said director or group’s good name and a long, slow climb back towards success (cf. George Lucas).  ,Thus we come to the Arctic Monkeys. And in so doing, we come to one of the most interesting aspects of hype and publicity: its selective presence. For while it is completely reasonable that as a temporary resident of Princeton, N.J. you are unaware of this band’s existence, such a state would be impossible to maintain if you were anywhere in England. In their native country, the Monkeys have been a phenomenon for over a year despite lacking a proper debut album – their success has been fueled by bootlegs, performances, and a frenzied press. Now that one has finally been released, it has broken all records for the fastest selling album in U.K. history.,The group was formed in 2003 by Alex Turner (vocals/guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Andy Nicholson (bass), and Matt Helders (drums). Their story involves people meeting in college, two of them receiving their instruments as Christmas presents, ferocious practicing of Strokes covers, and – of course – writing their own music. In late 2004, the band demos leaked onto the web – not a surprise since the band gave away the recordings at their shows, and this, combined with word of mouth and favorable press for a new rock band with danceable music and clever lyrics, began to get things moving. In May 2005, the band released an EP, Five Minutes with the Arctic Monkeys, and in June, despite studious avoidance of major label courtship, they signed with Domino. In August they played on one of the stages at the Reading and Leeds Festivals (the rough U.K. equivalent of the American indie-rockfest SXSW). Their grass roots campaign drew an audience of unexpected size to the show, and the U.K. media frenzy began. All of this, of course, long after the establishment of the band’s fan base via that boon to modern music: the mp3.  ,With this onset of serious press coverage came the expansion of the band’s popularity within the mainstream. The single “I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor” dropped in October and was followed in January with “When The Sun Goes Down” in preparation for the album’s release. Both songs reached No. 1. NME, which epitomizes the tendency of the U.K. press to blow things out of proportion, declared Turner “The Coolest Man On The Planet” in their annual “Cool List.” In January the album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, finally arrived, albeit only for English ears. To continue its tendency towards overblown characterization, NME has already called the album the fifth best record of all time. Which brings us to February 21, and the Monkeys’ very understated stateside arrival.  ,So what does one need to actually know about the Monkeys, and why and how have they managed this level of success? And why so little American press? Why no big MTV interviews or videos on TRL? Two reasons: one, the Monkeys have always done it themselves; and two, they are quintessentially British.,While The Monkeys have been hyped to death in their homeland, the fact remains that they made it on their own. Almost, if not all, of this album was available prior to its release through the Internet. As of this writing, if you go to the Monkeys’ Myspace account, you can hear the entire album without purchase. If you go to arctic-monkeys.com, you can download every demo track that isn’t yet available for sale. This is a band with immense faith in its fan base, and in the ability of the spoken word.  ,In many ways, then, The Monkeys are the counterweight to Coldplay, U2, and any other band that gets caught up in high-voiced wailing about abstract things. They fill a glorious little hole in the British pantheon, commenting on working class nightlife and bands in bars and underage drinking in straightforward terms, and do it so well and with such wit and charm that they have pulled a generation of U.K. teens behind them. ,The Arctic Monkeys, you see, have a good kind of rock. They play brit-poppish post-punk rock that draws water from a reasonable selection of modern sources, such as The Strokes, Blur, Franz Ferdinand, and the Libertines. This is a nice, if not especially unique, description of the band. They come from a grand tradition. But they bypass it by being intelligent: it’s the difference between “derivative” and “inspired by.”,The Monkeys are not remaking “Kid A,” but they are not trying to. Instead they are clever. They make you want to dance, and make you want to sing along. If Helders is not the greatest drummer in the world, he certainly makes me want get out of my seat in a club or drive that much faster down the highway. The Bass lines either swagger or sprint, but never plod. Guitars jam on “Vampires May Be A Bit Strong But…” and float in a light strumming haze on “Riot Van.” They speed through chains of riffs on each track and often solo. There are no strange time signatures here, just good music. They like to use verse-chorus-verse and get away with it because of their most famous feature: their lyrics. Turner is a very clever writer, and rhymes like “Your name isn’t Rio, but I don’t care for sand / Lighting the fuse might result in a bang” make my world the smallest bit better. He sings in a fashion reminiscent of heightened speech or slow rapping, and in an accent thick enough to float rocks. ,Whatever People Say I Am isn’t a concept album, but it could pass as one. The first track takes place the afternoon before going out, while the rest cover the full panoply of things one might see on a night out in Britain: the prostitute and her pimp on “When The Sun Goes Down;” the taxi stand fight of “Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured;” the tarted-up girl of “Still Take You Home.” ,Yet as Turner cuts through the Sheffield nightlife, he is no detached narrator who despises the scene he prods. Punning about bands that can’t play (“All the weekend rock stars in the toilets / practicing their lines”) and jabbing at his own fumbling approaches to beautiful women (“I’m talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can’t deliver it”), he comes across as sympathetic to this entire social scene. This is best epitomized in the saunter of “A Certain Romance,” the album closer, which begins as a diatribe about youth subculture in which “there’s only music, so that there’s new ring tones” but closes as he confesses his own inability to escape from or really object to his own roots.  ,Their music is undeniably for the young: few people over thirty are concerned about angry bouncers persecuting them, or are going to empathize with tongue-tied romantics in nightclubs. But it’s because The Monkeys are young; Turner is twenty. At forty, they will be writing epigrams about accounting.,The Anglo-centric nature of the album makes it a hard sell over here, and it’s a shame, because it should not be. If we cannot pick up on the specifics, like the precise locations of Rotherham or Hunter’s Bar, the gist is more than clear. Any song that reaches its emotional climax as the singer screams how your girlfriend won’t be surprised to find that you drunk dialed her multiple times and left long, rambling phone messages is going to be amusing (and strangely poignant) to anyone who has actually been to a party and seen it happen.,Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I Am Not is not now and will never be the fifth best album of all time, but it is certainly a promising start for a young band. This only makes the absence of American hype a positive thing, because the album just has to be itself and be heard. Too much press has a nasty tendency to result in a backlash, and next year that will surely happen to some other darling that masses of critic fall for. But for now we have these fellows, their quirky, undeniably British album that also happens to rock, and their relentless attempts to make it available to everyone. That should be plenty for any American with an Internet connection.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_sheffield_invasion/,"

"“All in all, I’m a dumb bastard… If you’ve got to, you’ve got to.”,Thus criminal Michel Poiccard opens in a voice-over in, Jean-Luc Godard’s classic 1960 film À bout de soufflé (Breathless). Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) looks up from a trashy newspaper exhibiting a tarty semi-nude, takes a few puffs from his cigarette, and hops down onto the street to hot-wire an American car. In dress, in ambiance, and in mannerism, Poiccard simulates the classic film noir hero—he is a shameless admirer of Humphrey Bogart. At one point Poiccard pauses outside a movie theatre to gaze at Bogart’s weathered yet self-assured mug, and like a little boy posing as his idol in a mirror, Poiccard takes a breath to draft that virility not only into his expression, but also into his style.,This was the second film in a series of films devoted to the idea of the rebel sponsored by UFO+, a subdivision of the University Film Organization dedicated to showing more sophisticated and artistic films (while UFO, or “UFO-“ as it is affectionately called, screens more popular or blockbuster films). UFO+ kicked off the series with the classic American film Rebel Without a Cause (1955). In addition to films rebellious in plot and character, UFO+ is screening films rebellious in style.,Godard’s Breathless is a classic of the French New Wave movement of the 1960s. New Wave films operated on tiny budgets, were shot almost entirely on location, and were tightly edited so as to be the complete antitheses of “epic” films. Barely 90 minutes in length, Breathless takes the heroes of American 1940s classics––characters with confidence echoing that of Raymond Chandler’s private detective Philip Marlowe––and fondly subverts them.,Poiccard breathes sans cigarette for perhaps five minutes of the entire film and rubs his lips continually in a truly Bogartian style. Yet Breathless takes place almost entirely during the day; where are the shadows for piercing gazes under lonely street lamps, or the sultry femme fatales enshrouded in cigarette smoke? Poiccard is film noir sometimes, but he is also stingingly human and, at times, pathetic in his confessions of love: “It’s silly, but I love you. I wanted to see you, to see if I’d want to see you,” he tells Patricia (Jean Seberg).,After stealing a car in the opening of the film, Poiccard drives through the countryside, commenting to himself, or to the audience, and cursing the other drivers. “Women drivers are cowardice personified,” he says at one point.,But just as quickly as his mind jumps from one thought to the next (he hums to himself, remarks “Nice countryside,” and goes back to humming), Godard cuts from shot to shot. Rather than shooting continuously, Godard cuts randomly and overtly to different points in time––different expressions from Poiccard, different thoughts, different cars on the road. Godard continues with the same style in shots of busy Parisian cafés, highlighting the rapidity of the people ordering, eating, leaving, rushing about. Yet at other times, Godard shoots for nearly two minutes straight without a single cut.,The film noir characters, entirely pre-meditated in their dispositions, become Parisian everyday-men with spontaneity, wrinkles, and desperate pleas for love––in films just as haphazard as their streams of thought. Godard intentionally parallels in the film’s style the behaviors of his characters. Both are equally human and quotidian. ,And yet, as Godard seems to draw the audience closer with such stylistic choices, he also seems to push them away. For instance, consider a long scene during which Poiccard lies in Patricia’s bed, having snuck in while she was out, only in his underwear. Patricia meanwhile sits on the bed, and they talk about love and relationships.,In this scene the male protagonist, reclining in a bed topless, is atypically sexualized. Patricia is fully clothed and several times gets up from the bed, walks around her room, enters the bathroom and returns. Poiccard continually asks her to have sex with him. He gazes at a magazine of pin-up girls and glances up Patricia’s skirt while she speaks of Romeo and Juliet and their undying devotion to one another. Distance is established in their dispositions toward love and eroticism.,And here, also unconventionally, Patricia seems to be in the more powerful position of the two. Poiccard appears desperate in his pleas for sex, and Patricia continues to decline in her capricious musings. She wanders the room in Poiccard’s shirt, studying a photograph of herself on the wall behind her. Perhaps because of the film noir role Poiccard is playing, he expects Patricia to fall into his lap and beg him for more––like the women of Chandler’s novels.,When they do make love, it is unclear. The two hide under the sheets like children playing hide-and-seek. Godard cuts from one ambiguous movement under the sheets to another, and when their lovemaking concludes, the same absentminded daydreaming ensues once again; neither really listens to the other.,While his characters engage in the act that is arguably the most intimate two people can share, Godard cuts intermittently and hides his characters from view. The viewer sits through nearly half an hour of their dreamy, disconnected musings. The viewer knows the intellectual aspects of the characters intimately, but in the emotional and physical realms, the audience knows virtually nothing of Poiccard and Patricia because of the distance between the two characters. ,Their romance began as a fling in Nice a few weeks prior. Each one is trying to determine if he or she loves the other. At the end of the film, Poiccard reflects, “When we talked, I talked about me, you talked about you, when we should have talked about each other.”,Each character strives to play a role, Poiccard admiring Bogart’s picture and Patricia contemplating her own in a man’s dress shirt. Each is out of place in society and in their relationship. And yet perhaps the distance they have from their ideals is the most human element of all. Godard flirts with the film noir genre in Breathless, but he knows that some affairs are merely satisfactory and that love stories can end only with separation.,Throughout the film, Poiccard speaks in slang that his American lover is unable to translate; she must ask, “What does that mean?” throughout the film. In the final scene, bleeding from a gunshot wound in his back, Poiccard says to Patricia, “It’s a real scumbag.” ,“What did he say?” Patricia asks a bystander. ,“He said, ‘You’re a real scumbag.’” ,A poor translation for a miscommunication – what could be more fitting for Godard’s epic tale of the everyday?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/breathless_at/,"

"When I stepped into the René Magritte exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, I stepped into a Magritte painting. The artist in many of his paintings depicted the ultimate “common man,” pudgy and ambivalent in bowler hat, overcoat, and cane. But Magritte placed this man in surreal contexts, like with a green apple in front of his face, or painted a thousand of these men falling from a blue sky like raindrops. It was the contrast of the two that gave his artworks their power and charm. As museum visitors entered the exhibit, they passed a tremendous tortoise-shell comb on carpeting of blue skies and white clouds. When I entered, I saw a thousand common men like in Magritte’s paintings, walking on sky and spawning like raindrops. Some were sizing up the comb and others were looking at Magritte’s painting of the comb leaning against a wall like that of the museum. Artist John Baldessari designed the gallery perhaps with these effects in mind. Next to some of Magritte’s works Baldessari placed artworks influenced by Magritte, drawing attention to the similarities between the two, and even, perhaps, bringing Magritte out of the past and into the day of contemporary artists. In some respects, this makes Magritte more accessible. In others, it merely glorifies him further; he becomes not just an artist, but a canonical one. I looked at the artworks differently than if the exhibit had consisted of a room with white walls, floor, and ceiling, of only Magritte works. In this case, I doubt I would have noticed the , at all. By fading into the background, the design would have drawn attention only to Magritte’s paintings and his paintings alone. And this is what I would have studied. Instead, thanks to Baldessari, I took in Magritte’s paintings ,. I compared them to the paintings they influenced and, in the end, compared myself to the objects of his paintings. Here I am, a common man like Magritte’s, trapped in a surreal world. What does this say about Magritte’s time and ours? Does it bridge the two? The answers really don’t matter. In his design, Baldessari has influenced the way we look at Magritte’s paintings. If we take a step back, we have to wonder: what kind of role the museum itself plays in the presentation of its artworks? When we go to a museum, we assume we’re going to see the artworks. Little do we realize the subtle profundity of the museum’s ability to alter our interpretations. ,The Louvre in Paris harbors not only the “Mona Lisa” but also its aura. From around the world, tourists come to the Louvre just to see that painting. In person, it is much smaller than you’d expect, perhaps because of the hype. Or maybe it was the distance the crowd enforced that made the painting appear so much smaller.,This room in the Louvre felt less like an exhibit and more like an altar to Da Vinci’s artwork––or perhaps to its aura. I felt this aura in the crowd of unruly tourists at the Louvre. Would it have impacted me so profoundly if it had been deserted? I almost wanted to glance at the “Mona Lisa” and run, just to escape the contained pandemonium. Just as I felt I had stepped into a Magritte painting at LACMA, I felt I had almost stepped into the “Mona Lisa” at the Louvre. Amid the hustle and bustle of people and rapid passing of time, I paused and held Mona Lisa’s calm and self-assured gaze. That moment in time isolated itself from all the others just as I detached myself momentarily from the madness of the crowd. What is an artwork but a moment in time preserved? Da Vinci had captured something, and now so had I. The intimacy I felt with the painting perhaps was only heightened by the crowd’s overwhelming presence. ,In ,, Susan Sontag discusses the ability of photo captions to alter the reader’s perception of the photographs. She writes, “…all photographs wait to be explained or falsified by their captions.” Sontag continues by describing a particular exhibition of photographs of 9/11: “While the image, like every image, is an invitation to look, the caption, more often than not, insists on the difficulty of doing just that.” The placards in museums traditionally list the name of the artist and the work, the year of its creation, its materials, and perhaps a brief historical account; they are oppressively harmless in their guise of neutrality. Even these placards, however, cast a different light on the paintings they describe. Sontag asserted the potential of captions for photographs––are the wounded in photographs victims or survivors?––and placards for artworks function in much the same way. Even in spaces dedicated entirely to visual display, language still plays with perception––perhaps even helping to create an aura like that of the “Mona Lisa.” The Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, for example, is famous for its very lack of placards. Albert C. Barnes was a scientist with a special interest in the arts. He collected fantastic post-impressionist works of art and in 1925 commissioned French architect Philippe Cret to design an art gallery for them.  The museum smells not of a stale gallery but of a mansion ornate in its love for art. From floor to ceiling Renoirs, Cézannes, and Matisses are stacked, as if the arranger compulsively hung up artworks to fill empty space. The museum is beautiful and humble in its display. Tracing the narrow hallways into rooms crowded with framed impressions is more akin to the giddy exploration of a wealthy uncle’s mansion than to the silent and deliberate march customary for the museum-goer. And the lack of placards contributes to this. When I paused to admire a painting, I didn’t stop because I knew it was a Monet or a Renoir. The genuine beauty of the piece caught my eye and held me. When was it painted? Where? What were the accepted interpretations of it? I didn’t know. If I wanted to find out, there were laminated guides at every bench ready to tell me. But I had to seek those out. In the Barnes, I admired artworks for their aesthetic appeal alone, not necessarily for their historical context. And this gave the museum the air of a home with artworks chosen for their beauty, not for their historical importance.  ,The Barnes doesn’t draw attention to itself; it seems to hint at itself. But the Guggenheim in New York City seems to share the spotlight with its paintings.,When I stepped off the subway and turned the corner to see the modern, structured-tornado shape of the museum, I stopped and stared. I hadn’t even gone inside yet and I was marveling at art. Inside the Guggenheim, cameras are permitted only in the lobby area, from where you can look straight up and watch the spiraling floors wind around each other to the skylight patterned like a spider’s web of stained-glass windows. I wandered through the museum with journal in hand, taking note of some of the paintings, impressive, of course. When I reached the top, I looked over the balcony to the people below meandering through the museum’s center. As I leave museums, I usually peruse the gift shop to find postcards of a couple of the works that particularly stood out to me. And this time, I picked out only postcards of the Guggenheim itself. Here was a museum I visited not for its exhibitions, but for the museum itself.,Indeed, many people visit museums for their atmospheres––not necessarily architectural. Museums have become loci for social interaction. Cafés seem to abound them, as if begging the museum visitors to chat and enjoy the museum not just for its art, but for itself, the context it provides. Not just its design from an aesthetic perspective can attract museum-goers, but also its design as a social space and even the particular demographic museums attract. When scoping out museums in London, my friend and I spotted the Tate Modern. As we were trying to fit it into our itinerary for our week there, we noticed in a tourist guide that the best night to go, it said, was on Friday––when the “cool crowds” thronged to the Tate. We found this too funny to pass up.  When at the end of our trek (several floors of exhibitions can wear a person out), we decided to grab a cappuccino at the museum’s café. And there we discovered the hip nightlife the tourist guide had mentioned. In a chic, dark room overlooking the River Thames, young and vibrant visitors sipped wine over tiny champagne-shaded candles, while dark hues of violet illuminated corners of the café/restaurant. As modern as the museum’s name would suggest, the café and its customers intrigued me. My friend and I spent an hour there just for the ambiance, for the understated excitement of the people dining around us. ,I have to wonder now what the ideal museum experience would be, but I have to admit that I unable to conjure up one. Inevitably, one way or another, context infiltrates creation. We can try to ignore the contexts, true, to attempt to experience the artworks in their essence––but this would only be an act of delusion. I was oblivious to specific elements of historical context when I visited the Barnes Foundation. But in no way is this a more authentic interpretation of the artwork than if I had known more about the artwork’s context. It is merely different. And I can’t say that I would choose one interpretation over another. It is the plurality that fascinates me and gives the artworks their power. And for what more could I ask, than a plurality of museums in which to experience them?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/museumologies/,"

"Though it is no replacement for the Annex, Sotto happy hour is still the best deal in town. House wine and mixed drinks are only two fifty; cocktails like the Bellinitini (peach, prosecco, mint) and the Lemon Drop Martini (lemon, sours) are only five dollars; beer is incredibly cheap. The crowd was mixed; a woman was having a baby shower overflowing with “It’s a girl” balloons and presents wrapped in pink ribbon; families with children filed in and out; a few singles in suits chatted at the bar. We were the only twenty somethings there. On the wall are clocks with the times in major cities: Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Princeton. ,While I was thrilled to be ordering a drink for my twenty first birthday, our formally-dressed ponytail wearing waiter just looked at me and asked: “is this your first place today?” By the end of happy hour, our waiter said he couldn’t serve us a new drink if there were more than two unfinished drinks in front of us, and then winked and walked away.,The cocktails come in cone-shaped cups held in a larger cup full of ice (which, although it looks really cool, does not do a very good job of keeping your cocktail cold) and the mixed drinks are garnished with fruit on tooth-pick swords. You can also order snacks; particularly good are the extremely cheesy mozzarella sticks. ,Considering the scarcity of bars in Princeton (there are only thirteen liquor licenses in the borough), Sotto happy hour is not to be missed. ,- Sadye Teiser,It was fucking freezing at 10 last Friday night when I looked up above a loading dock into a chic restaurant that, though designed in dismal hues, looked so, so warm. A man and a woman were gazing into each other’s eyes over a votive candle (like the one in which, after two martinis, my friend decided to burn her receipt) amidst a bar-gathering of New York’s artsy and urbane in carefully-crafted, black “slobby” evening-wear or suits with $300 tennis shoes. The fact that its loading dock was adjacent to its entrance was not surprising, for Public’s industrial aesthetic is completely intentional. At the maitre d’s desk, Public offers boxes of matches with its name–like other restaurants–but also classic yellow pencils with its name. Its menus look like work slips (?) and its walls look like they’ve braved the city’s smoggy test of time. But Public isn’t a converted abandoned warehouse. Its walls’ paint has been seared punctiliously, with the same attention to detail applied to its foods’ selection and preparation. Public serves kangaroo. Kangaroo. And this is just a starter.,I ordered butternut squash soup to start, with fried chickpeas buried inside and a melted marshmallow slowly dissolving on top. This was a weird combination, but somehow, it was amazing. It was these odd little marriages that gave Public its flair. The door leading to the women’s restroom reminded me of the formalist decor of the 1950s classrooms and offices I’ve seen in the movies, as stern in its design as the principal or private investigator reclining inside. The font in which “WOMEN” was printed easily could have said “PHILIP MARLOWE”. I opened the door and instead of a fog of cigarette smoke enshrouding the interior, I saw darkness penetrated only by a clan of votive candles. The intimacy Public offered through these creative choices stood in stark contrast both with its name and its theme; it made as much sense as the laissez-faire arithmetic used to create the women’s couture.,I really enjoyed Public at first. Those little touches kept me entertained throughout the evening. After a while though, I started to feel nauseated. I appreciated its craft, but Public eventually seemed contrived. I felt guilty that I felt at home in that warm refuge, keeping out the cold with cushy intellectual walls. Public wasn’t actually a rundown warehouse–but I guess I wouldn’t have felt much better if it actually had been. It is an intriguing concept, to serve such fine food in rooms that pair pseudo-grime with vanilla candles, but for some reason I just can’t stand it for very long. It’s like a Woody Allen joke; Allen makes fun of intellectuals, but through allusions that only intellectuals would get. In the process, Allen isn’t separating himself from them; if anything, he’s tying himself more closely to them with that tongue-in-cheek wink of the eye. Inside Public, I loved it. I loved the concept, I loved the look, I loved the color-scheme, the food was superb… but I can’t seem to let myself wallow in it for too long. It’s too carefully-crafted. It feels superficial.,Self-referentiality is lovely in small doses, but when you are not only what you eat, but where you eat, and the contrived dish you eat from, it  becomes entirely too much. Public is relentless in its self-involvement; so much so that its plates, trembling under pounds of kanga meat, become personal  referendums. Guilty dinners are best served by your mother in the suﬀ ocating privacy of your own home, for a night out I’ll take the 24-hour diners where  the mirrors are on  the walls and not on my plate.,- Justine Chaney,The best dish in Princeton is the flambé at La Mezzaluna. Although the main dishes (hazelnut and walnut encrusted rack of lamb, pappardelle with artichokes) are elegantly prepared, nothing compares to the plate of strawberries, blueberries, sugar, and triple sec that the waiter brings to your table and later proceeds to light on fire. The sauce from the flambé is artfully drizzled over chocolate chip gelato creating a perfect mixture of hot and cold. The Rigatoni with Italian eggplant, served in a hot, soupy tomato sauce, with warm mozzarella cheese and caramelized shallots is a standard and satisfying entrée. La Mezzaluna also has a selection of comforting, seasonal risottos, including fresh mushroom and seafood. The space is intimate and the crowd is typical: students sitting stiffly with their parents and friends, couples chewing silently on awkward dates, and people celebrating birthdays. La Mezzaluna, like most Princeton restaurants, is BYOB, but the waiters will still be happy to explain the difference to you between corked and uncorked wine. With heart-shaped decorations already set up at its tables, La Mezzaluna would be the perfect Valentine’s Day choice.,- Sadye Teiser",http://www.nassauweekly.com/restaurants_in_review/,"

"And the winner for the 2008 Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off is… Bill Lane!”,Bill leaned into his wife for a kiss.  His son beamed and Bill acknowledged the little boy’s pride with a hearty shake of his shoulder.  Bill rose and to acknowledge the audience’s cheers, he smiled, clutched his enormous belt buckle between his thumbs and his forefingers, and yanked up the front of his pants.,He sauntered toward the stage, happy that the day he blew his money on Miracle-Gro for had finally come and was almost over.  Soon it’d be nighttime, and tonight his wife’s day wouldn’t end when her son went to bed.,Bill set one foot on the steps to the stage.  He turned to see how his wife was.  She was teary-eyed looking from her husband to that 1,530-pound beast on the other end of the stage.  That thing needed ten men and 50 yards of rope just to move.,But just as Bill was turning, someone ran past him and leapt onto stage.  Bill didn’t realize what had happened at first; then he heard a voice in the microphone.,“Hi I’m not Bill Lane and this is not protocol but I have something to say.”,People stopped clapping not to listen but because they weren’t sure why to clap anymore.,“Yes so hi I’m not Bill Lane.  I’m Orvall.  Usually speeches by the losers aren’t granted in Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Offs, so I felt that this needed a change.,“Thank you for coming out here on this beautiful Massachusetts evening.”,People started to boo.,“Please.  Come on—oh please come on, really?  You all know me, we’re neighbors.  All of us compete every year—hey, hey, come on.  There are what, twelve of us here?  Let me just say something.”,People started whispering to each other.  “Oh God Orvall again?  You know what his son did last year?  His son sprayed every kid’s desk at school with Pledge—when the children tried to rest their heads on their hands, their elbows gave out and all of them—literally all of them, I saw their noses—knocked their heads on their desks.”,“Ok well hi I’m Orvall.  I’m the runner-up this year in the Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off, and I’d like to offer my concession speech.,“I’d like to take a moment now to have the honor of congratulating Bill Lane on being the winner of the 2008 Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off.”,Orvall turned.,“Congratulations, Bill.  This contest has been a test not just of skill and craftsmanship but also of perseverance and the endurance of the human will.  This is a historic contest; it’s the only 2008 one we’ll have, and I recognize the special significance it has for every member of our community, and especially our children.  It gives them good role models and good dreams to have.”,The audience started to clap for their children.,“I have always believed in this community of people.  This Safeway Pumpkin Weigh-Off marks the most important event of the year for me—even more important than Christmas.  Why?  Because it brings us together the way other holidays—even Christmas—don’t.”,Now people started to look away or shuffle through their bags.  Looking Orvall in the eye made them nervous.,“Even though I lost this year, I’m still happy to have been a part of the event.  Look at that pumpkin I grew.  It’s only 1,528 pounds, I know—and Bill’s a more impressive 1,530—but it’s huge!  That pumpkin gave me a reason to get up in the morning.  That pumpkin gave me a reason to turn off the TV, put pants on, and get my hands wet with the soil of the Earth.”,Someone stood up and yelled, “Hey Orvall—no one wants to hear it!”,Orvall was silent.  He was about to dive into some personal stuff, so the interjection really caught him off-guard.  “What—what do you mean?”,“What you’re talking about—nobody wants to hear it.”,Orvall was still stuttering.  “But…but why?”,“Orvall, no one cares what this pumpkin contest means to you.  We came out here to see some really big pumpkins.  And we did.  Now the day’s almost over and we sit through these formalities so that one day someone will sit through them for us when we’re heading to the stage.  Orvall this isn’t about you.”,“Listen,” Orvall said.  “It isn’t about me.  You’re right.  This is something I want everyone to know because I’m pretty sure they’ll be happy to know it.,“See, I had some problems, I’m pretty sure everyone knows that now.  Marcia moved out and took my boy with her—and I—I’m going to be honest—I turned to the bottle—“,“Orvall!  This isn’t an AA meeting!  No one wants to hear it!”,“But it’s a good story.  You’ll like the ending.  I promise.  I promise.  It’s really about all of you.,“Ok, so, not so long ago, when I wasn’t in a good place, well, I didn’t leave the house, I rarely got out of bed, I couldn’t even muster up the energy to shave.  That bottle of Jack was my only friend.  It was terrible!  I was no—“,“Orvall!  People are going to leave if you keep this up—“,“Look, just listen, that’s all!  I’m trying to explain why this pumpkin contest is a really great idea.  You’ll think about it in a way that I bet you never have before—“,“Orvall!  People like the pumpkin contest because of the pumpkins!”,“I know, I know, but you’ll like this, I promise, you’ll really like this.,“So back to what I was saying.  I was a mess, a real grade-A mess, but this Safeway Pumpkin Weigh-Off really turned things around for me.  I know it sounds funny, but don’t laugh…”  Orvall was smiling.,Now people began to leave.  Fathers were shaking their heads and mothers were leading their children out.  Orvall hadn’t noticed.,“It’s how I got my feet back on the ground.  All that addictive fervor I had, all that grief, all that anger—I channeled it into that pumpkin you see right there.  Yes, that pumpkin was grown with love, but also with pain and hate!,“Every morning I got up before the sun rose to take a look at my pumpkin.  Sometimes when I was inspecting it, I felt like I was waking it up, too.  I cooked up breakfast for myself and a special breakfast for my pumpkin and ate breakfast right next to it every morning.  I guess it was like we were both alone, and both growing, and we kept each other company through the hard times and the storms.”,The yeller stood up to say something else but stopped himself.  It’d been a while since he’d seen Orvall and he’d forgotten that he was this way, that this was just the way he was.  The yeller sighed and sat back down.  It was a little too early to take the kids home yet—if he did, he knew Amanda would start cooking immediately, and if she cooked earlier, they’d eat earlier, and he’d wind up going to sleep a little hungry.,“Every hour on the hour I walked outside to check on my pumpkin,” Orvall said.  “In the sun, I read next to it; in the rain, I erected a tent for it.  It needs water but not that much water, I figured, so I kept the tent up and watered it myself.  When my pumpkin had off-days, I had off-days.  It felt like sometimes there was a worm eating away at part of me, too.  We kept each other company and persevered through all of it.,“Now I’m here and I feel like a real person again.  I’m part of this great community again, and it feels great to be back.”,The yeller looked around—no one but his family was left.  His kids were getting antsy and his wife impatient with him., “My pumpkin didn’t win, that’s true,” Orvall said.  “It came pretty darn close but didn’t quite make it.  Well, that’s ok.  Bill Lane did a great job, and I’m sure he nurtured his pumpkin with as much love and care as I tried to.,“Marcia’s still gone and I haven’t talked to my boy since she took him…  But I’m getting better.  She said she wanted a new life with a different father for her boy.  That’s…I’m fine with that now.  That’s ok.  Now that I know I have this great community of people to count on, I know I’ll make it.”,Orvall paused.  He’d gotten a little teary-eyed.  He hadn’t been interrupted for a few minutes, so he figured people had really taken a liking to his story.  Orvall looked up, and no one was there.,“Oh—oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realize no one was here anymore,” Orvall said to the empty chairs, sort of mumbling to himself.  “God, I’m so sorry, Bill didn’t even want to give a speech?  I didn’t even talk for that long—why did everyone leave?  All I said was what a great community we have and how they’re better than Christmas presents.  They didn’t even—why did everyone leave?”,Orvall put his hands in his pockets.  The next morning, he planted lemon seeds.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/playing-telephone/,"

"Dear Mom and Dad,,    I have some good news and some bad news.,    Well actually let’s save that for a sec.  How are you??  I miss home a lot!  Mom, I got the care package you sent.  I really like the customized Starbucks thermos with photos from my childhood!  I also really like the family of Cuddly Bearista Bears, especially “Laissez-Bear” and “A Bear to Remember.”  Dad, that email you sent with your top 25 YouTube vid’s from the summer of ’08 was great.  All my hallmates thought it was bumpin.  Even my weird hallmate–the one from the Bay area, I’ve mentioned him before–said it was pretty “sick.”  Haha, don’t worry, that’s a good thing.  God he’s so weird.,    Have you guys been watching the election stuff?  I can’t believe Obama is friends with terrorists!  Crazy.  Also I heard the Bill Maher movie sucked so don’t see it.,    Ok.  Back to the issue at hand.  So there’s good news and bad news.  Dad, remember when you said that all you ever wanted was for me to be happy?  (It was in my graduation card.)  And Mom, remember when you told me to find the crystal pitchfork that I should tune the guitar in my soul to?  Well, I think I’ve found it, and it does actually involve a guitar!,    Here’s the good news:  I’ve decided to drop out of Princeton and audition for Neil Young and Crazy Horse.  I know it sounds crazy because Neil Young totally hit his peak 20 years ago and well, let’s be honest, he’s probably going to retire in about 10 minutes (am I right??).  I took that into consideration, and I formed a back-up plan.  My back-up plan is just to follow the band across the country (I’m 70% sure they’re touring right now) and live in the back of my friend’s van for however long I can do that. ,    You know what they say in Oh, the Places You’ll Go: “Somehow you’ll escape / all that waiting and staying. / You’ll find the bright places / where Boom Bands are playing.”  I’m not positive what Boom Bands are, but I imagine them like musical bands, with singers and drummers and microphones.  Princeton’s pretty boring.  There isn’t a great Risk scene here–all the kids are scary-competitive about it–and the Terhune Orchard trip only comes once a year.  I want something more!  And dropping out of school to audition for a rock band that isn’t hiring seemed like the thing to do.,    Dad, it’s like you always said–who needs a high school degree when you can get a life degree?  And Mom, you told me that the week you followed James Taylor around was the best of your life.  So now I’m going to follow in my parents’ footsteps and have the adventure of a lifetime–and all the way to Altoona, Kansas!,    Now for the bad news.  The bad news is–actually I don’t think there is any bad news.  I don’t know why I decided to structure the letter that way; that was kind of silly.  Should’ve thought that over a little more first.  Well anyway I’d ask for your blessing but I know I already have it (!), so I guess I’ll just say, you can cancel my Delta ticket home for fall break, because my friend’s driving me down in that van.  And, could you please send a little $$$ my way for food, blankets, etc?,    Well, my friend’s been honking for about 15 minutes now (it’s a vanity horn–the theme from “La Bamba”) so I better run!

"It seems the one story from the 2008 presidential race that nearly everyone–from Us Weekly to the New York Times–has picked up on is 17-year-old Bristol Palin’s pregnancy.  Bristol is the daughter of Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who, despite running with John McCain on the ticket of “Country and Women First,” has remained a staunch opponent of a woman’s right to choose.  It’s been unclear since the announcement of Bristol’s pregnancy whether Bristol was the one who chose to keep her child and marry the baby’s father Levi Johnston (a self-proclaimed “fuckin’ redneck”).  Suspicions that Bristol and the 18-year-old were pressured to start a family began to circulate almost immediately upon the news’ announcement.  On his MySpace page, taken down fast but not too fast for the media to snatch a few gems from it, Levi said he was in a relationship, but “I don’t want kids.”  It’s difficult to fathom an overnight change of heart from a teenager who likes “just fuckin’ chillin’ I guess” and lives “to play hockey,” and whose baby-granny happens to be running for VP.,   ,But in all the hubbub of Bristol’s pregnancy, one major issue was almost left untouched:  the question of statutory rape.  Sexual abuse laws vary from state to state, and according to Alaskan laws, Levi should be in no trouble at all.  In Alaska, the age of consent is 16, and Bristol was at least 16 when she had sex with Levi.,   ,Consider the laws of a different state though, like California.  In California, it is illegal for an 18-year-old to have sex with a minor, even if the minor gives consent.  It is believed that persons 17 and under aren’t quite mature enough to make that decision for themselves.  Because Bristol was less than three years younger than Levi at the time of the act, but because she was under 18, if they had been in California, Levi would be guilty of a misdemeanor and could be sentenced to up to a year in jail.,   ,Now, this isn’t just an exercise to make Levi out to be a bigger jerk than he already might be.  The two lucked out–legally-speaking–having sex in Alaska (assuming they did), because Alaska’s laws are laxer than those of other states.  But, though it kept Levi out of jail, one has to wonder just how great it is that statutory rape laws vary from state to state.  John McCain is a proponent of states’ rights, and unlike Sarah Palin, believes that abortions can be legal, but their laws should vary from state to state.  But imagine this scenario.  Suppose California permitted abortions and Nevada did not.  That’s in essence saying that it’s OK to kill a human being in California, but not OK just a couple miles away in Nevada–or, if we’re on the other side of the fence, that women should have the right to choose, but in California, and not in Nevada.  The answer to the question, “Should a woman have the right to choose?” shifts from an ideological one to an almost entirely physical one.,    It begs one to consider statutory rape laws in this light.  Is the question of the age of consent on par with that of abortions?  If it does indeed possess the same level of gravity, then perhaps this is a law that should not be left up to each individual state–but the question of its seriousness, and how to translate a grasp of this seriousness into legal terms, is a tricky one.,   The case of Bristol and Levi is a classic example of the challenges lawmakers face.  A law has to be consistent.  It can’t operate on a case-by-case basis.  Some 16-year-olds are mature enough to weigh the dangers of intercourse with its pleasures, but some clearly are not.  How can a law accommodate different rates of maturation?  It simply can’t.  So, sometimes we have Bristols and Levis, inadvertently starting families together.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/bristol-and-levi-finally-luck-out/,"

"Rarely in this age of metaphysical detachment do we encounter such an utter embrace of the visceral as found in Riskay’s gift to the ages, “Smell Yo Dick”. In this piece, Riskay laments what she believes represents the steady decay of her relationship with her boyfriend. Riskay’s friends report sightings of said boyfriend in clubs “flossin’ hard” with a “Ho named Diamond”. Riskay knows this is the beginning of the end. I feel the utter throb of her desperation and angst in her melancholy appeal:,That I called and left yo’ ass messages,I done text yo’ bitch ass,,And u ain’t respondin’ to nothin’,What the fuck is you doing,Who the fuck is you out there with,You think I’m stupid,,My gurlz already done put me up on your ass tonight,When u get home I got some news for yo’ bitch ass,Other than photos taken by oft-unreliable cell-phone cameras, Riskay has no tangible evidence of her boyfriends’ “trickin’” with “dirty full of bitches”. It seems there is no way to know for sure. Riskay’s friends say he’s “grindin’” like dat; he says he’s not “clownin’ like dat”.,Riskay intentionally prevents the listener from forming his own verdict; all she offers him in the course of her dynamic ballad is hearsay. “Smell Yo Dick”, in its complex portrayal of the plurality of truths (or of the void of a singular truth?), harks back to Kurosawa’s “Rashomon”–and like Kurosawa’s masterpiece, forms no definite conclusion. We never learn whether or not Riskay’s boyfriend has actually been cheating.,Indeed, in order to reconcile the somber reality born of the abyss of objective truth, Riskay turns to the only truth that seems to exist in this life, that being ,. What we know is inevitably defined by the limitations of our own senses, and rather than wallow in this seemingly-debilitating state, Riskay ,it, and her assertion of the power of the human will to subsist in a potentially-bleak world also affirms the capacity of the female to hold her own in the presence of the male. Riskay steps forward:,Somethin’s goin’ on, can I smell yo dick,Don’t play me like a fool, cause that ain’t cool,So wat u need to do is lemme smell yo dick,Riskay follows her instincts by following her nose, seeking out that crushing stench of Latex. Like a dog, Riskay has marked her spot with her bodily fluids, and she refuses to let any other bitch claim that territory. From this cesspool of existential crises, vaginal fluids, urine, diluted truths, and Axe body spray, Riskay emerges victor, trumping not just romantic snags, but also the limits of the senses and the death of the truth in her ,In the song’s title itself, Riskay plays on the complications that arise from reading and interpretation. Examine the title. “Smell Yo Dick”. Clearly, this could be seen as an elliptical lifting from a line from the chorus (“lemme smell yo dick”). But take a second look. “Smell Yo Dick” could be elliptical, or Riskay could be exploiting the ambiguous form of the verb “Smell”. Here, is it the infinitive, the 1st person, 2nd person, singular and plural? Could it be the ,? If it is the imperative, Riskay presents the listener with a command with dual significance. Taken alone, the title would seem to suggest that Riskay wants her boyfriend to smell ,dick, and, in this way, take a good look at himself. Why is he lyin’ to her, cheatin’ on her, creepin’ on her? Evaluate the repercussions of your actions, Riskay seems to say.,But the verbal ambiguity of the title offers yet one more dimension of significance. Riskay might even be asking the listener to smell ,dick, as well. What are,doing? Riskay asks. It seems not to matter whether or not you’re cheating on someone, or whether you’re even in a relationship. Reevaluate your actions in the context of the metaphysical insights of this piece. What are you ,doing? And do you like what you’re doing? Smell yo dick, and see if you ,how it smells.,In a word, Riskay keeps it real. None of the flowery flourishes like the accents that belong to words like “risqué” that we borrow from the French. Just give it to us straight. Spell it like it is. Smell yo dick.

"I don’t quite understand why the advertising team behind Mitchell Lichtenstein’s ,Dawn is aggressively socially conservative; she chooses to save herself and leads a group to help others save themselves (or just to save them?).  Apparently because she grew up near a nuclear power plant, Dawn’s vagina sprouted teeth without her knowledge—and these work as an incredible defensive device against unwanted intruders.  The film is shamelessly littered with prosthetic appendages.,If , is meant to be a cautionary tale, I’m not really sure what it’s warning against or why.  ,might be warning against rape like ,warned against adultery—but if it is, it’s making a very unconvincing argument.  “Don’t cheat because the girl you bone might be a bipolar, homicidal psychotic!” sounds about as convincing as “Don’t rape someone because that vagina JUST MIGHT bite your cock off!”,If anything, , more convincingly argues against nuclear power by citing the incredible genetic mutations it can induce.  The statistics being what they are, I think I’m more likely to have consensual sex in my life than nonconsensual…  A toothed vagina would probably put a damper on that, so as awesome as it would be to wreak that kind of havoc on uninvited guests, I think I’d prefer not to have a radioactive bear trap down there.,I think , makes for a much better chick flick.

"In most of the reviews I’ve read of Michael Haneke’s Funny Games, the film is said to be an assault on the audience via disturbing physical and psychological torture of its characters. A twisted set of events begins when two mild-mannered young men clad in white (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) enter the vacation home of George (Tim Roth), Ann (Naomi Watts), and their young son Georgie (Devon Gearheart). “Let’s play a game,” Paul (Pitt) says.  “How about you bet you’ll be alive at 9 tomorrow morning, and we’ll bet you’ll be dead!”  Pitt delivers the line with wide-eyed delight, the kind of excitement we’d expect from the family’s young boy, who stares blankly at Paul shivering and crying in utter terror––much more in touch with reality than elder Paul is.,I didn’t find Funny Games particularly scary on a visceral level.  I’m not saying this to suggest I have a hard stomach for movies like this.  I don’t.  I over-think them and too often imagine what it would be like to be in the characters’ shoes.  I try to freak myself out. Funny Games invites its audience to do just that – freak itself out. Funny Games establishes a genre that marries horror with documentary.,The film’s best moments stem from the depiction of the aftermath of an evening of unfathomable torture.  (Warning:  plot spoiler approaching.) In the wee hours of that morning, the two sociopaths leave George on the floor nursing a bleeding knee broken hours before and Ann in her underwear, bound at wrists and ankles. One shot stands out in my mind.  It lasted a good few minutes, which naturally, given the rapid bursts of violence preceding it, felt like an eternity.,It is the family’s living room, where the tortures had taken place.  A couch faces away from us in the foreground, and a couch faces us in the background.  George lies in the far left corner of the screen, behind the front couch, and Ann hunches in the near right corner beside the front couch, diagonally across from him.  Beyond her, we see her son’s blood splattered against the white wall.  Though it is out of sight, we know his body still lies there, drenched in the blood oozing from the back of his head.,Ann and George breathe not sighs, but maybe gasps of relief.  Their son’s corpse lies behind them, but the sheer horror of his murder has not quite set in yet.  It is clear that what is on their minds is also on our mind:  “What do we do now?”  And this, I think, is the most interesting element of a horror film.  What does a person do after hours upon hours of the unimaginable?,In this prolonged shot, we watch Ann struggle to stand up.  And the camera doesn’t cut away when her endeavors prove futile and, frankly, a little boring.  It stays there, gazing at her.  Our female protagonist—a hero of sorts for surviving this long—now begins desperately to stand up.  She throws herself back, trying to balance on her feet, but each time falls back forward onto her knees.  She hops closer to the couch’s corner, trying to bounce up and lean against it to get herself upright.  It’s exhausting and frustrating just to watch (she can endure the brothers’ terrible mind games but can’t stand up?).  Because of his injury, George is out of commission, placing him in an emasculated role we don’t see too often in films like these.  Ann eventually stands up, huffing and puffing after all the energy it took.  She leaves the frame and, as if in real time, returns a good few minutes later, finally no longer bound up.,This real-time effect is twofold:  it makes the film much more real, more so than shots of the gory violence would have.  In comparison to generations past, I don’t think there is any doubt that most of us kids today are somewhat desensitized to violence.  It doesn’t instill the horror that it might once have.  But we rarely see our heroes this antiheroic.  Their physical and also psychological paralysis plays itself out slowly, thereby making us feel much closer to the characters.  The brutality becomes all the more real, and in this way, all the more chilling.,But such prolonged visual silence also gives the audience plenty of time to mull over the utter profundity of what it’s just seen.  All I could think about were the years of therapy the couple (no longer family) would need after this night.  I imagined their marriage falling apart, each scarred forever.  The deliberative pause the film took at this point offered me the opportunity to do just what I needed to do to freak myself out:  over-think it.,And the logistical horrors just continued.  What do you do in the absence of a landline and a working cell phone?  How do you call on your neighbors for help from their gated driveways?  George and Ann are completely alone, the original appeal of their secluded vacation home now contributing to their helplessness.,Because of his bum knee, George sits by their soaked cell phone with a hairdryer in an almost comedic effort to resurrect it.  Ann throws on the first thing she finds in their unpacked suitcases­­—literally, throws on clothes she can run in.  I found these simultaneous and really very unimportant actions fascinating.  Watts’ performance was spectacular.  Through her hurried breathing, her curt replies, and her darting eyes I could tell her character’s mind was operating at an almost supernaturally rapid and efficient pace.  It was the decisions essential to their survival—does she run outside?  Does she risk running into the brothers?—that kept Ann’s mind of her young son’s tragic murder, while for George, it was the mindless and ultimately futile action of blow-drying a decrepit cell phone that absorbed him and preserved his sanity, if only for a few more moments.,Through stylistic and narrative choices like this, the reality of the horror set in, and at times I felt like I was watching an authentic record of an unnaturally tragic demise.  To intellectualize the film the way that others have—depicting it purely as an assault on the audience—is to miss the brilliance in some of these subtle touches that really do play with your mind.  It is better to look at Funny Games not as a horrific intellectual film, but as an intellectual horror film.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/something-not-played-out/,"

"Thirty years ago, Gil Scott-Heron, a black poet and songwriter, wrote the song “Winter in America.”  He sang:,”Democracy is ragtime on the corner/ hoping for some rain/ And I see the robins perched in barren treetops/ watching last ditch racists marching across the floor/?Just like the Peace Sign that vanished in our dreams/ never had a chance to grow, And now it’s Winter, Winter in America/ And all of the healers have been killed or betrayed. But the people know it’s Winter, (Lord knows it’s) Winter in America, and ain’t nobody fighting, ’cause/Nobody knows what to save.”,In 1974, it must have seemed like winter in America.  Nixon had won a second term in a landslide, the idealism of the sixties was dead, the leaders of the sixties were dead, assassinated and disappeared.  ,The past week has found me listening to Gil Scott-Heron (along with Eminem’s brilliant new song, “Mosh”), feeling a dark foreboding of things to come.  We’re back in the seventies, embroiled in a war with no end in sight and in an economy that will only get worse, as oil prices skyrocket.  More American today believe in the Virgin Birth than in evolution.  We are a society that by all accounts seems to be regressing; America may yet prove to be a new Rome.,It’s winter now, and I finally feel the sadness that my parents must have felt during the eighties, during the last conservative backlash.  The past couple of years, we built coalitions based on hope and tolerance, based on our idealization of what America ought to be like.  But we’ve failed.  People are dying across the world, and we are not helping them.  People are losing out here at home, and we are not helping them.  Instead, we sit idly by as corporations take over family businesses, as religious fanatics impose their vision of the world upon those who disagree with them.,This past week has found me lost in a sort of madness, searching for Election Day conspiracy theories on the Internet.  I’ve become privy to every incident of voter fraud and suppression that occurred last Tuesday.  I’ve sent emails to congressmen and made telephone calls to cable news networks.  I look to the results on the Florida Election Board website and notice that over two hundred thousand more people voted on election day than signed in to vote.  Did the Republicans cheat?  Did they steal the election?  Probably not.  In my desperation, my need to prove that somehow people didn’t vote for this monster, much less provide him with a mandate, I’ve tried to regain my faith in the American people.  I’d like to think folks in the “heartland” would rather have health care than to ban gay marriage, but it seems as though I’m wrong.  If there’s one lesson we’ve learned from this election, it’s this: Americans really do hate gay people.,The depression one feels because of geopolitical events is a strange one.  I’m not particularly scared of a draft, even though I think it’s likely.  Nor am I particularly concerned about an economic downturn, even though I think that’s likely as well. Most devastating to me is what has happened to the America I thought I’d always known.,I finally understand that the pastoral America I’ve taught myself to love – a liberal America, an America of erudite farmers and minor league baseball teams and strong trade unions and people who understand the goodness of tolerance – does not exist.  Perhaps I mistakenly mythologized people like Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner’s character in Field of Dreams), and Atticus Finch, people who stood up and fought for what they believed in because it was right.  Maybe that’s precisely the problem: we who are right – and we liberals are not right because we’re arrogant, we’re right because we’re right – have always been in the minority.  The majority of this country has never been fair or tolerant; it has always been a struggle to make this country a better place.  Perhaps my ideal America never existed.,But I think it did exist, and I think it still exists.  Underneath the intolerance that frequently bubbles to the surface, there is something inherently wonderful about this country.  I love and continue to identify with the fierce Americanism of the early American Communist Party, of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, of prematurely anti-fascist folk singers who sang ballads of unions and of peaceful class struggle.  I believe in the liberal traditions of the WPA and the CCC, of National Public Radio and of a well-informed and well-educated population.  ,On Election Day, I canvassed a working-class town in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  When we stopped for pizza, the owner wore an “I make food, not war” t-shirt; he spoke to us of the need to kick the “liar” out of the White House.  Across the street was an old faded record store, playing some Motown and Bruce Springsteen as a man in a wheelchair (whom I took, for some self-serving reason, to be a vet) waved a Kerry-Edwards’ signs in front of traffic.  Cars honked and people cheered as they drove by.  That town, for me, embodied the America that I can still believe in.,Republicans I know seem to do a very good job at compartmentalizing their support of George W. Bush.  They agree with the Bush tax cuts, but they don’t agree with his stance on abortion.  They agree with his stance on abortion, but they don’t agree with his Iraq policy.  Some agree with all of the above but they abhor his gay-baiting.,Meanwhile, our nation’s labor laws have devolved to the point at which almost all workplace safety mechanisms are voluntary.  Workers can lose their limbs in slaughterhouses and be forced back on the job the following week – without receiving any compensation.  Pollution controls have been dramatically scaled back, and corporations control an enormous amount of legislation.  Karl Rove just announced that George Bush would seek an amendment banning gay marriage, and that such an amendment is crucial for a “decent society.”  Supreme Court vacancies may very well be filled with justices who oppose Roe v. Wade and who will implement their own “activist” agenda from the bench. ,Maybe it’s better, in the long run, that George Bush won reelection.  Republicans will not be able to pin our failure in Iraq on John Kerry.  They can create their “ownership society,” and we can watch as the “owners” become fewer and richer.  Republicans can pretend this country has gotten over its racial problems, but when there are riots again, they will not be able to pretend any longer.  At the moment, we are in an abyss; this country has given in to its most base impulses, but we will recover.  ,In his new song “Mosh,” Eminem raps: “the stars and stripes/have been swiped/ washed out and wiped/ and replaced with his own face.”  We need to take back the stars and the stripes.  It’s winter in America.  Eventually, spring has to come.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/winter_in_america/,"

"Once a long time ago, on a dampish isle some miles off the coast of France, C. S. Lewis wrote, “Flippancy is the armor against God’s Grace.” Actually, I’m not sure of that quote. Let’s say Lewis could have scribbled down any or all of the following: “Acerbic retorts are the armor against God’s Grace;” or “Cutting repartee is armor against God’s Grace;” or “Oscar Wilde, in general, and his plays, in particular, are armor against God’s Grace.”  Regardless of the exact singsong of the quote, the point holds: to be perpetually droll is terrifyingly akin to being perpetually cruel. Take that Kelsey Grammer, you little balding bitch.,There is something inhuman in forever pacing the ramparts of your tower, sniping the hapless villages below with vicious witticisms. In Tom Stoppard’s brilliant play, “The Real Thing,” the protagonist, a gifted but snappish playwright named Henry, keeps the whole cast in his crosshairs. Henry passes the two hours of stage-time mocking the assorted weaknesses of lovers, husbands, offspring and political prisoners. This makes you hate Henry sometimes— but Stoppard is too deft a playwright to abandon his protagonist to the fate of annoying-ass Smarty Pants. Henry is also, contrary to the crushing reality of his sex life, a diehard, old school believer in capital-L LOVE. Well, at least, Henry is as much of a romantic idealist as a man who cheats on his wife and child and runs away with an actress can be. This play has a lovely way of vexing the simplest assumptions of character.,“The Real Thing” is an unromantic, fairly unflinching exploration of the practical viability of monogamy, the existence of true love, and the possibility of absolute, enduring emotional commitments. Prepare yourself for some pretty openly conversational scenes in the play, where nihilism tangos with absolutism, traditional values trades barbs with, well you know— all that heavy, philosophical stuff I mentioned in the prior sentence. But don’t fret: this play is funny. Not in a “Battles of the Sexes,” clichéd type of funny, and definitely not in line with the Farrelly Brothers’ sensibilities. Imagine instead a double episode of “Fraser” dealing with more complex themes and written by one of the British theatre’s most established and cunning playwrights— and without any David Hyde Pierce. ,Director Greg Taubman made a number of smart choices in his production. The first was putting up the show at all. Taubman has already shown a marked commitment to staging demanding and nuanced shows (“Master and Margarita,” and the downright grim “Merrily We Roll Along”) that have actual literary and theatrical heft. The difficulty, however, in staging shows outside of the light comedy and sugar-pop musical categories is they demand considerable talent from the cast, designers and director in order to pull them off with any finesse. ,To be frank, American college students, even considering their substantial enthusiasm for the task at hand, are awkward choices to play jaded, contemporary, Baby Boom-busted British intellectuals and professionals. Credibility takes a blow— or this case, a series of gut punches.  Ben Mains, playing Henry, has one of those magical theatrical British accents that slips and drifts and, especially at the end of his sentences, vanishes altogether. Amy Widdowson, playing Henry’s first wife, is too irrepressibly vibrant and too Canadian to play the hyper cynical, fifty-something victim of the West End. Her spunk nonetheless is always enjoyable. The two gentlemen (Jon Miller and Arthur Dudney) who play Scots sound like my Uncle Padraig after six Guinesses trying to talk to William Wallace while watching “Braveheart” on the telly. I’m not sure that’s the type of authenticity for which the director was striving. ,Bridget Reilly Durkin is the most successful in leaping the considerable hurtles before her and delivering a strong, emotionally resonant performance as Annie, Henry’s lover. Some of the play’s loveliest scenes are due to Durkin’s portrayal of Annie puzzling out her relationship to Henry and the implications of love and bodies growing ever older. Newcomer Chris Arp, as Annie’s cuckolded husband, is also responsible for one of the production’s strongest scenes, confronting his cheating wife with a captivating intensity. Because of her confidence and blue hair, Kassi Jackson does a smashing job of playing Henry and Charlotte’s punkish teenage daughter. Doubtless, acting a character near her own age and cultural moment cements her performance further.   ,An unfortunate combination of harsh lighting and congested blocking threw many of the key scenes into a tight, one-dimensional show of shouting, shaded side profiles. The set, an alcove of suspiciously wobbly looking Piet Mondrian-inspired panels, seemed on the edge of complete collapse throughout much of the show but did feature some cool-ish changing color effects. But hey, what did old C. S. Lewis say? Bitching is the breastplate of holiness? Whatever. The moral remains the same: “The Real Thing” is a demanding play put on by hardworking actors and an earnest director. The playwright’s brilliance and the players’ enthusiasm show forth in equal measure.,[Performances of The Real Thing run November 4-6 and 11-13 at 8 PM, with a 2 PM matinee on November 13. Ticket prices are $12 general admission; $1 seniors/ faculty/ staff; and $6 students/ children. At Hamilton Murray Theater at Murray-Dodge Hall.

"The big story to come out of this election was pretty boring.  Apparently, 22% of voters cited “moral values” as their number one consideration when casting a vote, and most of those votes went to President Bush.  I’d like to offer my own analysis.  I think it’s sexier, and I hope you will too.  Call it oversimplification, but does anyone else think that maybe Fox’s one-hour drama “The O.C.” has anything to do with Bush’s victory?,The show, about the entangled relations of teens and their appallingly hot parents in the second most populous county in California, draws its strength from a dead-on depiction of place.  Perhaps the weekly spectacle of bronzed bodies and palatial homes isn’t what Orange County is actually like, but that doesn’t matter; it’s what we all want it to be like.,At first that might not seem particularly relevant to last week’s election.  But Orange County, home of Disneyland and shopping malls and surfers, birthplace of Richard Nixon, has long been thought of as a bastion of Republicanism. According to Wikipedia online encyclopedia, Republican voter registration in Orange County tops Democratic three-to-two.,Presumably, the O.C. G.O.P. is quite different from the Midwest’s hardscrabble, values-obsessed Republicans who’ve been getting so much press lately.  One might even assume that the Dubya supporters of the O.C. are the Schwarzenegger-loving, “lay off my money, you commie!” sort. Sure, there are plenty of upper class and upper middle class people who oppose abortion and gay marriage, but it’s also probably reasonable to assume that those aren’t the factors keeping Orange County overwhelmingly in the red.,Now that Orange County has its own television show, watched by 8.48 million viewers on Nov. 4. alone, it does not seem a huge stretch to say that Orange County, its lifestyle and its implicit politics, have widespread appeal.  Did anyone ever think to call it “The” Orange County before Josh Schwartz did?  The politics of Schwartz, the creator/executive producer, are unknown—he hails from the cold, wet blue state of Rhode Island—but nonetheless, if I were Karl Rove, I’d be calling him to thank him for getting out the wannabe sun-kissed vote.,Why do I say “wannabe sun-kissed?” Because unlike “Family Matters” or “Growing Pains,” or any of the shows that made up the 18-30 demographic’s childhood television , “The O.C.” is not about normal people living normal lives.  It’s about normal people who happen to be very good-looking, living dramatic lives that, at least financially, are extremely comfortable.  It’s like “Saved by the Bell” or “90210” but ratcheted up about ten notches.  Each week “The O.C.” exports a lifestyle to millions of viewers each week who will never have Marissa Cooper’s body or Seth Cohen’s salty wit and who will certainly never frolic in a beachfront mansion on the Orange Coast.  But they’d like to.  The average American would love to be in the shoes of Ryan Atwood, the preternaturally buff boy from Chino who got in a little trouble but whose goodness and vulnerability just so clearly screamed “I’m goodwill hunting!” that Sandy Cohen couldn’t help bringing him home to Newport to his preternaturally buff wife and son who, while not preternaturally buff, probably scored high on the verbal section of his SATs.,This season kicked off with Seth off in Portland, trying to escape the “fake” world of the O.C.  Dismayed with his family and its indolent lifestyle, after Ryan left, Seth skedaddled up the coast in search of a richer life experience.  How does Seth Cohen find meaning in Portland?  By giving sailing lessons.  After much angst and persuasive visits from Ryan and Sandy, Seth makes the easy call and gives up the Pacific Northwest for SoCal.  “You know, they don’t even have a water polo team here?” Seth quips to Ryan. “That’s going to be a problem for me.” Schwartz and his team are clever enough to trap his characters in a place that many Americans would love to be. There’s no escape from the world most of us live in.  But once you’ve reached the magical tax bracket, you’re set.,It’s an idea that dovetails nicely with the tax cuts of the Bush administration.  Though the Cohens are presumably silver spoon liberals—last season saw the entrance of Grandma Cohen, a sassy Jewish liberal from Brooklyn—and the Coopers hardnosed Republicans, the lifestyle of both families befits the fiscal conservative fantasy: I make my own money, spend it how I want, and don’t tell me what to do with my sex life.  (i.e.  Don’t tell me not to sleep with my daughter’s boyfriend and then with my next door neighbor’s father, something most values voters probably wouldn’t agree with even if they knew the secrets of Julie Cooper’s Faustian self-preservation tricks.),And yet there’s the troubling moral comeuppance that has already been visited on Julie Cooper’s first husband and now appears to be lying in wait for her second.  White collar crime in Newport?  Like, no way.  It’ll throw a major kink in the lives of everyone involved—excluding maybe Summer—if Caleb Cooper, Seth’s grandfather, goes to jail for bribery, embezzling, or whatever shenanigans he’s used to amass his ridiculous fortune.  The fortune, made in real estate and development, is at risk because the D.A.’s office, where Sandy oh-so-conveniently works, is closing in on an investigation into Caleb’s misbehavior.  Sandy’s connections enable him to keep Caleb rather cryptically informed.  In a parking garage rendezvous, he tells his father-in-law: “Either they’ve realized that they’ve got nothing, or they’re building one hell of a case.”  As a viewer, this line didn’t exactly send chills up my spine, mainly because I didn’t buy it.  With Caleb’s business kaput, where would anyone live? By my count, seven to nine of the main characters are currently living off the fat of his corrupt company.,Some of the characters are in for ruder awakenings than others.  Having seen her father ruined by similarly shady business dealing, Marissa already has a taste of the less-than-fabulous life.  A summer job at Payless Shoes isn’t exactly what her debutante upbringing prepared her for, and who knows how long she can throw poolside hissy fits at her mom and stepdad’s estate?  Despite the ostentatious wealth of most characters, the only two wholly unprepared for a reduction in lifestyle are Seth and Kirsten, both of whom grew up rich and have never experienced anything else.  One of the best moments of last Thursday’s premiere came when Seth revealed the real details of his summer adventure sailing in the Pacific:,“First, I sailed to Catalina. Then I sailed to Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara, I ran out of snacks. Freaked out a little bit. Pawned my boat for cash. Took a bus to Portland.”,Ryan, in utter disbelief, stares at his friend. ,“You took a bus?”,Who wouldn’t want to live in their world?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_oc_returns/,"

"Something about last week—Tuesday night, Wednesday noon—made me want to see the Princeton University Players’ production of Into the Woods.  I wanted to sit in the dark, my mind shocked into silence by way of bright sensory overload.  I wanted the good guys to win—that elusive fantasy reserved these days for children and librettists.  I wanted parents to have flown in and to have brought flowers.  I wouldn’t have cared if the show wasn’t very good; at least I would have borne witness to something earnest and well-intentioned.  But the show wasn’t bad at all, and I even found myself quite specifically rooting for the Witch (Danielle Ivory) to fall mug-first from Rapunzel’s (Aimee Mungovan) tower.  That’s a frustration I’ll take right now—harmless and fleeting.,I have tremendous trouble getting past the visual distaste of student theatre—the inevitable compromises in casting, the costumes reminiscent of a working suburban mother’s artifice the night before Halloween—hurriedly but handily assembled.  The opening of Into the Woods—laying out the exposition for a trinity of familiar fairytales—immediately accosts the audience with a slightly grotesque three-way spectacle.  Cinderella’s wicked stepsisters (Erica Duke and Erica Andersen) look like second-rate impersonators of Alexandra and Vanessa Kerry.  The witch looks like a creature that should get her ass back to the Terrace taproom, where she would probably bump into me with her fat-girl tits and spill my beer.  This sort of nose-wrinkling visual is usually accompanied by brassy vocal bombast, as the first row’s collective hair is blown off by a sophomore from Forbes who wants to show the audience just how very badly she wants to make it big.  ,Thanks to a fourteen-piece orchestra in an unnecessarily intimate venue, and the fact that the production could not afford microphones, there was a distinct lack of that aural sock-knocking I look for in a musical.  The sound issues were a particular problem in the larger ensemble numbers, like the opening, where the three-way vocal duel just plain overwhelms, and you can’t understand a word anyone says.  When I couldn’t hear Cinderella, I was pretty sure she was crying for a mike.  At first I thought that no one—with the exception of proven Katzen-stars Aimee Mungovan and Amy Coenen—had any meat behind their upper register, like the whole show was out of their range.  I was proved overly critical and uncharitable when the cast one-by-one proved their vocal mettle in the much more satisfying second act.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t blame the audio shortcoming on human beings on stage, and instead had to chalk one up to PUP’s limited resources.,Director Marisol Rosa-Shapiro ’07 did well with those limited resources.  In adjusting a show (which she obviously understands and loves well) to the limits of stage and production, she achieved a particularly endearing campiness.  Jordan Flowers ’05 (Prince Charming/Wolf) was a champion of that campiness, mugging like Mario Lopez in a made-for-TV Greg Louganis biopic.  He bears the show’s onerous comic burden—making up for countless, specifically unfunny one-liners.  If Rapunzel’s Prince (Andrew Saxe ’08) doesn’t sparkle, he does have a beautiful voice, which heightens the weird silly Jean val Jean v. Inspector Javert aspect of the “Agony” duet.  Charming provided that special bombast I was looking for—and deliberately, too.,The stepmother (Amadea Britton) should have taken her cue from Prince Charming.  She played much of her part straight and emotional, when she should have made good, farcical use of her character’s comedic potential.,My date left at intermission; he missed all the good stuff.  I don’t blame him for leaving: the first act dragged.  The characters moved on and off and around the stage in a constant barrage of fairytale “fun.”  It was Saturday morning fun with Sunday morning values: preachy and constantly teaching annoying lessons about resourcefulness and self-respect.  Despite the best efforts of the absolutely delightful Dan Kublick ’07 (Narrator/Mysterious Old Man), who was goofy, tender, and right-on, I was pretty sure I hated the show at half-time.  The witch needed to own the first act of this show and she didn’t.  Except for the fact that she couldn’t enunciate through her rubber witch mask, her performance was entirely competent.  Perhaps it’s just the unfair standard established by Rapunzel’s heavenly musical emissions—clear as a bell—but it seemed that the Witch couldn’t belt out her numbers with the requisite starlet ass-kicking. It was clear that she found herself to be the star of the show, but she couldn’t back it up—her confident flair was completely absent of substantive charisma.,Mercifully, someone in the production didn’t find her to be the star of the show, and the final call was given to deserving baker and his wife.  The Baker’s Wife (Amy Coenen ’07) outclassed everyone on the stage; her capable performance was tender and beautiful.  And she’s got the starlet pipes I’ve been looking for—I can’t wait until the PUP powers that be let her out of her apron and into her own.  The Baker (Rob Walsh ’07) could stand up to Amy both vocally and emotionally and lent his role a dearly stalwart quality.  In their care, the second act redeemed the show.,For a while, the second act bled, preachy and unpleasant.  I wanted to be buoyed—and while I anticipated a happy ending, the frustration of the second act made me question its arrival.  Have faith, though – while the happy ending may tarry, it comes indeed.,A series of winning songs—musically and emotionally satisfying—build toward the finale.  After particularly stellar contributions from the Baker’s Wife, the Baker, and the Mysterious Man, Little Red Riding Hood (Christine Ritzius) tops off her strong performance with a perfectly adorable little spell of tears, the company took the stage for a warm and rousing finale.  I felt nostalgia for some place I’d never been.  ,I was often dismayed by the interjections of the real world in my musical fairy-tale: marital strife, premature death, intermittent sadness and violent destruction.  Into the Woods wasn’t the fantastic, childish escape I was after.  Instead, the real world –  along with real emotion – seeped into the show, and provided enough of an emotional extension for a light catharsis and a warm-hearted nostalgia: I teared.,The Princeton University Players’ production of Into the Woods plays at the Matthews Acting Studio at 185 Nassau November 11-13 at eight o’clock.  There is a two o’clock matinee on Saturday the thirteenth.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/pups_into_the_woods/,"

"It is typical summer weather in Moscow. The cool gray haze of the morning opens up for a couple lazy afternoon hours into a northern, cobalt sky with big, low hanging clouds. They swing, brooding, scissored by the slants of barely warm sunshine. Occasionally, they empty themselves onto the none-too-startled Muscovites jostling around below. “I was walking to the metro and it just started raining out of nowhere,” complains Anya, puffing on a cigarette in my friend Olga’s already smoky kitchen. She paws at her now damp, mousy bob as if to provide us with the evidence. A bleached blonde – another of Olga’s college friends whose name I don’t remember – slips her stocking-ed foot in and out of her edgy silver pumps and commiserates out of the side of her mouth. ,The doorbell rings and Olga goes to answer the door while I struggle to make awkward conversation with these two rather cliquey girls. Russian girls tend to be that way, I’ve noticed: closed, cold, condescending. Unlike the bland, dilute expressions of Russian men, their faces are always forbidding. In the metro, on the street, in simple interactions with a stranger, they radiate a mute insolence from their peephole eyes: deliberately blank but viciously scrutinizing. A diffuse defiance streams from their tightly pursed mouths and the sneering lift of their jaws. But these girls try a little before slipping back into esoteric gossip. I am an old friend of an insider, after all, and we are all here for her birthday party. Grudgingly, the claws retract.,Soon the apartment fills and the many tables Olga has linked together under an endless tablecloth across the length of her parents’ living room make sense. The huge table, flanked on one side by a brown couch, is surrounded by every chair in the apartment, its surface set for twenty guests with matching little green plates, a smorgasbord of silverware, countless salads, pickled and fresh vegetables, beer, wine, and, of course, vodka. A roast sends fragrant tentacles around the apartment as it bakes sleepily in the kitchen. This is a Russian birthday party. There is no awkward American social hovering and circling, no unadorned, hungry drinking in a packed, breathless room, no screaming to be heard in conversation under a thick blanket of music. Here, strangers are quickly introduced and the awkwardness of not knowing everyone melts away as one communal conversation takes shape over the food and drinks that fall down the gullet easily and uncountably. The guests sit around the table and toast the birthday girl with shots of vodka, eating down the warm trickle with pickled tomato or mayonnaise-slathered salad, and tell anekdoty, or jokes. ,It is a culture of joke telling, and every conversation inevitably bleeds into a deft joke-putting match. How one performs in this game is a gauge of social adroitness, a way to earn social capital. The expert will catch the energy and attention of the room with ease and deliver the anecdote crisply to the point; its finely spun details, improvised but measured and vivid, will echo and amplify the ribs of the pun. Unlike in the U.S., anecdotes in the literal sense of true story telling – “This one time, a friend of mine got so drunk that…” – have little place in this culture. In Russia, everyone is a unique, rarely overlapping encyclopedia volume, constantly updated and replenished, full of the types of jokes that, in America, circulate in office e-mails but rarely in real conversation: “A man stumbles home drunk at three in the morning, reeking of Roquefort…” ,There are, of course, the “bearded” jokes: those old, lame chairs that clutter a conversation. There are the simple jokes inherited from childhood and spiced with adolescence, with their staple characters: talking, drinking, farting bears, or stupid little Vovochka, a delinquent second-grader whose bluntly told tales of his dysfunctional family and sexual innuendo shock his teacher into verbal paralysis. But Russian jokes at their best are witty, dark, and telling. They are replete with the old ethnic tensions of the Soviet Union: Georgians squabble with the Armenians, and Russians rag on everyone else (the Ukrainians, the Byelorussians, the Finns). The older generation tells jokes rich with historical and literary allusions that are slowly losing meaning for the young as the standard Soviet curriculum rots off the bones of the crumbling education system. ,By the time the roast is served, the table is littered with half empty wine glasses and tall cans of Baltika, the Russian Budweiser. It comes only in half-liter cans and most people at the table have tossed back at least one and a half by this point, shuttling between gulps of the sweetish beer, boxed wine, and Flagman, the Beast of the vodkas. In an attempt to prevent the unnecessary loss of precious vodka when a merry, gesticulating arm might knock it over, the engineers at Flagman devised a special type of bottleneck. It is a typically Russian invention: when you want to actually pour yourself a shot, the vodka breaks against the bottle’s plastic mouth and sloshes angrily back. “We wanted to make it better, but it turned out as it always does,” Yeltsin’s Prime Minister Chernomyrdin once said, and I can’t help but remember this now infamous quote as I watch Vlad, Olga’s boyfriend, work up a liquid tornado in the bottle before quickly tipping it over into his glass.,I had forgotten how Russians drink. I hadn’t been to Russia in quite a while and, since moving here in 1990, my family has become tamer, more American. Fresh from Prospect Street where I had drank more than my fair share of cheap booze and seen many a well-bred Princetonian drink himself half-blind and knock-kneed, I came with an open mind: it’s just a bloated old stereotype, I thought. But it’s true. Russians drink more and they do it better. After a few days in Moscow, I got quite used to the alcohol kiosks at every step and to the bleary eyed men in the metro, nursing brown bottles as they swayed to the train’s sleepy rhythm. But these are the alkashy, the alcoholics. More normal Muscovites prefer to drink indoors or in the parks and then only when it is nice outside or if there is an occasion: a date, friends gathering, some hard knots to think straight.,Young Muscovites, however, do it with panache. A week after the birthday party, Olga, Vlad, Natasha and I met in an American restaurant called Foodville in the MegaMall on the outskirts of Moscow. Aptly named, the huge shopping complex, complete with one of Moscow’s three wildly popular Ikeas (which Russians believe has yet to reach us), puts American malls to shame. If Stalin could have built a mall, he would have built Mega. In Foodville, they’ve run out of pretty much everything, including beer. Vlad, a Russian version of a Southern California surfer with his long, greasy blonde hair and shirts that never fail to reveal the full glory of his tanned, muscular arms, cannot settle for Coke. He runs to a neighboring pub and brings back three half-liter glasses of beer. “Why three?” Olga asks. She and Natasha are both driving and the law is stricter in this respect than in the States. Absolutely no alcohol if you’re behind the wheel. And, strangely enough considering all the stereotypical drinking that young Russians do, there is always a designated driver on hand, sipping a virgin daiquiri as the bottle of Flagman makes its rounds. Without pausing to think, Vlad calls over the waiter and orders a shot of the cheapest vodka. (Most restaurants have vodka lists as long as the wine lists.) When it arrives, Vlad drops the sweating glass into the tall, pale beer and engulfs the entire mess in a few hearty gulps. “Problem solved,” he grins, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.,At the party, Pasha sits with his back to a window curtained with standard white Russian lace. It strains in just the liquid metal light of the fading afternoon, and his figure, cut into negative, looks like a living woodcut, his swinging arms caught in the huge arcs and asymptotes of his story. He has just returned from a windsurfing trip to Egypt with Vlad, his best friend. It is a popular destination for Moscow’s growing sub-culture of young ekstremaly, or extreme sports enthusiasts. Unlike windsurfing in Russia’s frigid lakes, Egypt is always sunny and warm, and best of all, cheap. Vlad and Pasha, already well into their twenties and working steady, white collar jobs during the day, sink huge parts of their salaries into windsurfing trips to Egypt. Each time, they bring back loads of equipment – all the boards, cables, sails, and wetsuits that cost triple in Moscow – that sells in a flash for a very comfortable profit. This time, Vlad returned just in time for Olga’s birthday with the perfect gift for a rookie windsurfer: a huge, garish green windsurfing board, which Olga instantly dubbed “The Joker” for the cackling face that laughs off the hard foam. She is addicted now, too. I called her once to make plans and caught her when, in the glorious afterglow of a day of windsurfing at Istra, she had pulled her car over at the side of a country road and sat listening to Bob Marley “in remix.” “Just ‘super,’” she croons, with Marley’s voice in the background, weaving through the thudding, gulping techno layered under it.,Olga is my age and still has a year-and-a-half left at a prestigious Moscow university. “That’s my institute,” she says pointing to an old Soviet building, squat and brown, gliding past us on the gray stretch of highway. “I haven’t been there in months,” she laughs. Getting a good job that will feed not only her windsurfing addiction but her resume is much more important. “If you apply for a job straight out of college and don’t have anything on your resume but school,” she explains, “people think you’re some kind of retard.” She interviewed for several jobs while I was in Moscow and was hired by Manpower, an American headhunting firm. Despite her schooling in computer science, she happily signed on to do secretarial work and some small translating jobs. It is a common route: no matter what college has trained you for, get a job, any job – “even if it’s sitting at a desk by a bathroom, answering phones,” Olga smirks – and try to get noticed, try to get them to move you up. ,Sipping the Baltika left over from Olga’s party over some delivery pizza, Oleg, Olga’s best friend, beams with this promise of upward mobility. “Man,” he says tipping back in his chair and jamming his fingers into his platinum hair, “man, they love me now. The whole office knows me, and they’re so cool with me and I’ve only been there a month! And today, one of the older guys came to me for computer advice!” We toast his success. Both he and Olga are working hard on their temporary summer contracts to attract attention and ultimately to stay. “But what about school in the fall?” I ask. “What about it?” Oleg answers. They both plan to keep working full-time and squeezing school into the off-hours. And if it doesn’t fit? “I have no problems going part-time,” Olga responds decisively. She means, of course, going part-time to school. ,This new generation of Russians, who matured as the old Soviet attitude of “we pretend to work and you pretend to pay us” was just beginning to tear at the edges, are beginning to learn the Western business tactics they believe will give them the edge in a rapidly expanding, volatile economy. They dress sharply for work, they are on call for tech support in their off hours, and, unlike their elders, they actually take the time to respond. And though customer service still has quite a ways to go in Russia, the younger generation, especially those in the booming high tech sector, is slowly learning to deal patiently with their frustrating clients. Natasha, a recent graduate of the Moscow Oil and Gas Institute, has designed a program to smooth the business wrinkles of a gas station chain. Everyday, a station worker calls to complain of mysterious problems that show his ineptitude with computers rather than her program’s flaws. “Everyday, they call me and say, ‘it’s broken,’” Natasha groans. “So I ask them, ‘How is it broken? What happened? What does the screen say?’ And you know what they tell me? ‘I don’t know. It’s just broken.’ What the fuck are they doing with these machines? Beating them with hammers?” The next day, after we stayed up late drinking vermouth in her kitchen, she gets up early to drive out to the distant gas station and see the problem for herself, only to discover that the problem doesn’t exist.,But a job, no matter how frustrating, promises not only security but the spoils of the Western consumer lifestyle that Russians have lusted for since the Khrushchev thaw. On a bench in the ten o’clock twilight of Pushkin Square, Oleg expounds his Russian version of the American dream. “One day, man, I’m going to make it so big,” he gushes, sweeping the curve of his future’s size with a bottle of Tequiza, “Like my boss. Bigger! I swear, he must make like twenty thousand Euros a month. And then! Oh man, I’m going to wear these really slick suits from Mexx, like, bam! And just strut, you know? And I’m going to have the sweetest car-” I interrupt him, “What kind? A Benz?” He screws up his boyish face, “No! Everyone here has a Mercedes. I want an Alpha Romeo.” He pushes his palms along the machine’s imagined plane, “Red.” Why? “Because it’s more than just transportation, you know? It’s a status symbol, it’s, like, who you are. Like, when people see me driving it, they’ll all be like, ‘Damn, that guy is the shit,’ you know?” Oleg is the personification of the electricity rattling around in Moscow’s smog: things feel like they are getting better, like Russia is getting better, that it’s back on its way to the top. ,If one stays just in the center of Moscow, that certainly seems to be the case. Venture past the various “ring” highways that gird the city, however, and the electricity quickly evaporates. In Krasnogorsk, an hour outside of Moscow, little has changed from Soviet times except the new contrast with the nearby capital’s mushrooming wealth. The roads are punctuated with massive craters full of stagnant gray water. There are no sidewalks, only old boards strung intermittently along the muddy, pockmarked shoulders of the road. The restless sense of dirt, grit, and poverty is pervasive. Unlike their chic counterparts strutting around Moscow’s streets, Krasnogorsk residents still dress according to the Soviet norm: wear whatever odds and ends you can find. Here, one is reminded of the skewed, federalist metropole-periphery politics that have several Far Eastern provinces bucking against the center’s drain on their natural resources without any return investment in their dilapidated local infrastructures. ,In Moscow, however, no one thinks twice about these dynamics, though they help power the city into a promising new prosperity. At four in the morning, the northern June sky is already stretched thin, bulging with morning light. Olga, Oleg, and I tramp out of a club and down the still or already humming Tverskoy Boulevard looking for a taxi. We turn a curve to face the walls of the Kremlin looming ahead. Its bricks, the color of dried blood, swim in the cool light of massive projectors. My feet have been dancing all night in tight stilettos and the White Russians I drank are loosening their warm grip, so I flip the Kremlin my middle finger. Wounded, Oleg instantly protests. “What was that for?” Shocked further into sobriety, I respond, “Well, there’s a reason we left.” Olga quickly intervenes. “Don’t get him started on the Soviet Union,” she sneers. “He thinks it was a fabulous time for everybody because his dad was some kind of Party scientist. And at least there was order, right?” she says mockingly to Oleg. “There was!” he shoots back, his feet still bouncing from the dance floor. “And it’ll happen again. We’re gonna show everyone who’s boss!” My instinct is to roll my eyes and wave a dismissive hand at him, but my gut shivers at the threat implicit in this promise. A car stops by the curb. Oleg negotiates the distance and the price and we get in, Oleg riding shotgun. Lulled by the driver’s silence and the thinning night, I ask Olga if a lot of Russians our age feel this way. “I guess,” she says, keeping her voice low, protecting Oleg, “but they’re all retards.” ,On one of my last nights in Moscow, I find myself in Kirim’s jangling car with Olga and Natasha, happily digesting a meaty Uzbek meal. The sun is setting, spraying color through the smog onto the white sea of Soviet era apartment blocks. Elvis croons over the din of the old car and Olga’s laughter. “Love me tenderrrr, love me sweeeeettt,” Kirim howls along from the driver’s seat. “Never. Let. Me gooooo.” Now a successful young programmer who has luckily managed to slip the closing noose of the draft, he had followed the old Soviet ant route from Central Asia to the golden dreams of the capital, moving from Bukhara in the mid-nineties to get a Moscow education. Now he lives with Natasha, whom he met in college, in a one-bedroom they rent from a man who has moved to St. Petersburg. Things have changed. As much as Natasha’s father protests against this cultural mixing and trouncing of Russian sexual taboo, Kirim and Natasha live happily on their very comfortable, Russian yuppie salaries, disregarding his protests and those of Kirim’s traditional Muslim Tatar family. They entertain with daiquiris and vermouth in their tiny kitchen, the presumed wedding hovering somewhere in a dateless future. ,They are the new Muscovites, living on the city’s upswing fed by the resources of a sprawling, almost starving country, and this infects them with the optimism of participating in sweeping economic change. Between Oleg’s pining for Soviet order, Natasha’s frantic arguments for the rights of Georgian and Armenian immigrants (the hated “black-asses”), and Olga’s absolute apathy, the politics are hard to pin. But the trend in this rather new slice of Russia’s socio-economic pie is clear: life is still tough, but it’s getting better, and the comforts of the good Western life are finally within their reach. There was a time when Russian girls would marry anyone just to escape life in the Soviet Union. America was the ultimate destination, but many settled for less when the bastion of capitalism proved unreachable. Uganda, for example, was still infinitely preferable to years of waiting for a government apartment or car. Now, there are very few, especially in Moscow, who want to leave. Though the dark Soviet sarcasm they’ve inherited keeps their feet on the ground, Moscow’s young middle class is eerily reminiscent of our own driven young elite, rigorously planning their careers and weaving through the setting cement of Russia’s Wild, Wild West economy.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/young_moscow/,"

"I think I was the first person unassociated with Swimming Upstream to see the production.  Ever.  This seems like pretty heady stuff as I sit in warm darkness waiting for the cast’s final run-through to begin.  I feel like an insider: I watch volunteers scurry behind the set with big rolls of duct tape, I silently side with the musicians in their power struggle with the sound guy, I smile benevolently at the writer’s nervousness.  I have no idea what I’m getting myself into; really, no one does.  The sign says WORLD PREMIERE- maybe I’m gonna be a part of something big, I think.   From the sound of the band warming up, it looks like I’ve got a rock musical ahead of me.  As far as I’m concerned, no good has ever come out of a rock musical-Hair, Rent, Tommy-spare me.  But still, this could be something big.  Then the show starts, and I’m thinking I couldn’t have made this up if I wanted to.,	In Swimming Upstream, there’s a new kid in school, and he’s got dreams.  He wants to write a musical; something funny and moving, all at the same time!  He gets his chance when he is assigned a creative health class project.  What follows is his pursuit of the ‘in-crowd’ as his cast, and the development of his musical about sperm.  Since the whole show poetically mirrors the challenges of sperm swimming toward an ovum, I am intermittently subjected to huge slides of the act of conception.  As our hero faces the problems of bullying and falling for the prettiest girl in school, so our sperm faces deadly acids and threatening antibodies.  And the audience faces an hour and a half in a small, hot black room, staring at a monster-size genital-pink birth canal set.  Now, I’m a liberated woman-I’m pro-choice and I love tampons and all-but the effect is indeed menstrual-nauseating.,There are several horrendous interludes.  If the biology slides aren’t enough, every so often seizure-inducing carnival-style music blares, and a diminutive masked man bounds about the stage.  His name is Conscience McBadass-and yes, this is where I realize I couldn’t have made this up-and he shows up periodically to cajole the main character toward the glory of a smash-hit health class musical with integrity. En route to that glory, our main character tries out several different styles of musical.  The show’s best number is its Gilbert and Sullivan take-off, as Todd imagines his show as “The Pirates of Men’s Pants.” After the pirate seduction scene, Todd dreams up a stupefying operatic presentation of the binding of Isaac which dissolves into a song about smegma.  It is needlessly gross, and I don’t get the musical allusion, which is probably even more offensive. Todd cheerfully offers this scene as a “modernistic show that won’t make any sense,” and the same can be said of Swimming Upstream.,	It’s a concept show, absent compelling plot or narrative.  Whatever imitation of plot exists is murky at best.  Since this is a thoroughly modern musical, the writer and composer feel free of the bounds of common sense.  Since there’s no set to speak of and no narrative dialogue, it would be convenient-no, critical-that I be able to hear what they’re singing.  I do figure out what’s going on after about ten minutes.  But when I do figure it out, eighty minutes of guesswork remain.,For all those eighty minutes, the script can’t seem to decide on a level of realism.  The characters burst into song constantly, but every so often one character will stop another and tell him how wonderful a singer he is, how glad he is to have overheard him singing.  The confusion triples as Todd dreams his musical-in-a-musical.  The dependable musical conventions are present-the dreamy, winning boy, the unattainable babe with a heart of gold, “I am” songs directed at the audience, a duet that unites our hero and heroine-but those conventions are obscured with “modernistic” self-awareness and creativity.  Musically, it’s a boy and a girl and a barbershop quartet, and thematically it’s a boy and girl and a musical. Eventually, the dream girl inspires the dreamer boy to be himself, to create a musical that is all his own.  Thusly inspired by love and integrity, Todd puts forth a piece about sperm swimming upstream toward fertilization.  This explains why the theatre has been transformed into a gaping vagina, but it does not justify the spectacle.,	Despite all the ridiculous vulgarity and painfully deliberate layering, the most off-putting component of the show isn’t even on stage.  The powers that be behind this musical clearly think they have smash hit.  It borrows elements of recent popular successes like Rent, Urinetown, and Avenue Q.  It rocks and rolls with indulgent vulgarity, and it plays on the idea of a children’s entertainment for grown-up “laughs.”  The songs are annoyingly catchy, and the winning anthem is repeated ad nauseam, so as to make sure that the audience doesn’t miss it.  Watching the writer watch her show only sharpened the embarrassing disconnect.  The producer-type in the audience laughed, and beamed, and really looked hopeful.  It reminds me of Waiting for Guffman, but in real life it feels tremendously depressing.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/swimming_upstream/,"

"Last week, Princeton was subpoenaed for the names and information of almost forty students, in preparation for lawsuits the RIAA is bringing against them against them.  On Monday, the Nassau Weekly’s Jessica Woods sat down with one of the accused to find out the real story.,Jessica Woods: So tell me about [your] Legal Defense Fund that I’ve heard so much about.,The Accused: Well, seeing as I’m going to have to spend at least a thousand dollars to defend myself against the RIAA, I figured I’d start selling t-shirts or something. I mean, I was only sharing, not stealing.,JW: I think that’s an important distinction.  Did you deal mainly in movies or in music?,TA:  I did both, but I am only being sued by the record industry people, although I have heard that the Motion Picture Association of America has begun to step up their prosecution.  Thank goodness I’m no longer connected to my sharing device, and will not be getting in trouble with them unless they already have a subpoena on its way.,JW:  So if you can just disconnect from your “sharing device,” what keeps you from just erasing all of it?  Do they know what you have?,TA:  Umm, that’s called obstruction of justice; that’s how Martha Stewart and Richard Nixon got in trouble.  And the office said explicitly in the email not to do that.,JW:  The email from the RIAA?,TA:  The RIAA emailed Princeton who emailed me.,JW:  Did the RIAA choose some IP addresses at random?   How did they select these people?,TA:  I don’t even know how I was selected.  Personally, I don’t think I’m a big sharer but maybe I am.  They chose these IP addresses and decided to subpoena Princeton for the information about who the students are who have these IP addresses.,JW:  So all the users were Princeton students?,TA:  In this specific case I’ve heard that there are about forty defendants or something.  I’ve spoken to a few kids–so far all Princeton–but the RIAA has done it before; they file hundreds of lawsuits like this a year, if not thousands.,JW:  Who goes to law school to spend their lives filing these rote lawsuits?,TA:  Actually, they don’t even employ lawyers anymore.  They just employ paralegals because the stuff is so simple.  They just churn ‘em out, left and right.,JW:  What are the results for the RIAA?  What’s in it for them, if they keep suing, and everyone keeps sharing?,TA:  I don’t think there’s any possible way that they’re going to stop file-sharing, but what I think they are going to do is stem it a bit, to slow it down.  I know people who, because they’ve heard about this, have stopped for a little while.  And yeah they will start doing it again but they have temporarily paused.  There is a sense of fear that you’re gonna get slapped with a lawsuit.,JW:  Does it seem like more of a scare tactic, then?,TA:  They target a university community and they get the word out and people get scared and they stop doing it for a little while.,JW:  So do you think that that’s the point as much as limiting the copyrighted material that’s out there?,TA:  I think that’s the point. It’s not about the money.  In most cases they settle for a couple thousand dollars.,JW:  How do your parents feel about it?  Are they prepared to step up with a couple thousand dollars?   I mean, are they file-sharing types?,TA:  They’ve actually been pretty supportive.  I was worried that they would be really angry.   Because I had all these crazy plans – delete all my files, blame it on my roommate, that sort of thing – their attitude has been pragmatic.  They were just like, ‘That’s obstruction of justice.’  So… they’ve been pretty supportive as long as I don’t do anything stupid.,JW:  Does Princeton OIT have an official position, that it’s wrong, or that this sort of thing is just inconvenient?,TA:  It’s against the University policy.,JW:  Really?,TA:  Yeah, infringement of copyright law.  That was mentioned to me, but I think the university feels bad enough for me that I think they’re not gonna take any action—cross my fingers.,JW:  It would be really annoying to get probation for file-sharing.,TA:  I think the University’s policy is that it needs to be a series of offenses—they needed to have warned you before, and they’ve never warned me before.,JW:  Sort of like their policy on date rape.,TA:  Yeah.,JW:  So what kind of files were you actually sharing, if you can say?  I mean, were you looking at kiddie porn?,TA:  It wasn’t kiddie porn.  There was no porn.,JW:  Were you downloading stuff that hadn’t come out yet?  Brand-new pop hits? ,TA:  I was only using it to download stuff I wouldn’t have bought anyway.,JW:  That’s a good point, I mean, you’re not gonna buy that sweet new Lindsey Lohan…,TA:  Yeah, I wasn’t about to go buy Lindsey Lohan Rumors, or Britney…I’m not really worried about Britney, and, you know, like, paying her.,JW:  She just puts her shit out there anyway, if you know what I’m saying.,TA:  Yeah she does.,JW:  And apparently she’s pregnant?,TA:  She is kinda fat.  I think she’s just trying to explain why she’s fat.,JW:  And then she, like, loses the baby in tragedy and emerges a star.,TA:  She goes to one of those two week centers where you lose like thirty pounds.,JW:  Do you think the RIAA executives go to those sort of like colon-cleansing clinics?,TA:  I don’t know, does it cost four thousand bucks?  Cause that’s how much they’re gonna get out of me.,JW:  Did you have pirated movies that weren’t in theaters yet?,TA:  No.,JW:  Did you have music that wasn’t released yet?,TA:  No, not as far as I know.  Well, I did have a lot of Fitty [rapper 50 Cent].,JW:  I wouldn’t worry about the RIAA if I crossed Fitty.  I’d worry about the gun slinging.,TA:  Yeah, I had pop stuff, and indie stuff that no one downloaded from me anyway.  Like, who downloads Stella Star?,JW:  Did they catch you from people uploading from you? ,TA:  I had the sharing function open so people could upload from me.,JW:  Which program did you use, if you’re at liberty to say?,TA:  I2hub.,JW:  Oh, that’s the hot new one.,TA:  That’s the one with all the universities.  You need to have a university IP address.  They had never prosecuted people who had used it before—you need to have a university IP address and somehow the RIAA hacked into that, or bribed some fucking douchey student to let them to look at their stuff.,JW:  Honestly, that was like the promised land of file-sharing–I thought it was really safe.,TA:  Yeah, it was, but I was in the first string [of lawsuits].,JW:  This is actual breaking news.  There’s never been news in the Nassau Weekly before, but here we go.  I2hub: don’t do it.  How does  that affect DC++?,TA:  I’m aware of a lawsuit involving DC++ so they did that too.,JW:  So they’re doing DC++ and i2hub at once?,TA:  That’s my impression, I’m not totally positive.,JW:  So, are they just making a point or are they making money?,TA:  My impression is that they’re breaking even.  Cause they’re using paralegals, and paralegals don’t get paid a hundred bucks an hour, they get paid like ten.,JW:  Twelve on a good day.,TA:  Yeah, fifteen if they’ve got tenure or some shit. ,JW: Hah.,TA:  But what I think is really sad is that the people who they target are college students.  Like, they’ll sue 40 kids at BU.  They’ll sue 100 kids somewhere else.   It’s not like they’re going after adult professionals.  They’re going after students who don’t have money.,JW:  Do you have a closing message for our readers?,TA:  Don’t get sued (glances around Mathey courtyard).  Look, there’s Silas.

"Nassau Weekly staffer: Can the Nass have free seats to the fashion show tonight so that someone can review it?,Event chair: No, it hasn’t been arranged, it’s impossible… But I will personally buy you a seat if you can guarantee me some sweet-ass press.,Operation Style put on their annual charity fashion show on Friday on the Frist South Lawn.  It looked like a benefit in a second-rate but affluent suburb, or a production at a private school looking to increase its endowment.   There was a giant white tent, lovely models, nice donated items. There were even cheerful announcements: the silent auction is in the back, remember to buy raffle tickets.  The tent was impressive; it covered most of the lawn.  And it was teeming with people.  ,Maybe because it was pre-frosh weekend and there was nowhere to go, but even if there had been, who could have resisted the spectacle? There were darling shirts(1) and posters, plus the tickets were free and it looked like there might have been food inside. Turns out there wasn’t food, but there was loud music, courtesy of Rafe Corkhill’s spinning.(2),Operation Style put the event on to raise money for—isn’t this charming?—Operation Smile, sort of a Doctors without Borders (Médecins sans Frontières) that performs plastic surgery.  I don’t mean to belittle their work—they do good things, we’re talking corrective surgeries in third world type places – they perform like cleft palette surgery and harelip surgery.  It’s important to fix these life-changing deformities and all, but why the student group chose to put on a fashion show to benefit the cause is beyond me.  Beautiful, thin, four-limbed, bright-eyed Princeton students earning money for deformed Philipino infants.,Last year’s show featured an especial ironic treat: a guest speaker from the Operation Smile organization itself, who was a South Asian island type. We saw a slide show of his life and he had a goiter the size of a football growing out of his neck. It was honestly the grossest thing I’ve ever seen – in or out of a circus – in my entire life.  Anyway, he took the stage between modeling segments, so it’s like Oh! What a gorgeous Theta! and then Oh god! What a hideous and crippling deformity!  It was mostly awkward, but also a little appalling.,In any event, this year Operation Style managed to jettison that section of the evening, effectively divorcing their fashion show from its worthy beneficiary.  The organizers decided against raising awareness of Operation Smile’s cause or educating their audience about it.  Instead they opted for this strategy: mention buying a smile; inform audience that above-mentioned buying a smile is for a good cause; and suggest that buying a smile is important.  What is this smile?,I’m still not sure what a cleft palette or harelip is, but if it’s anything like that goiter from last year, then buy away. This hardly-even-vague connectedness to Operation Smile involved neither advocacy nor service to people in need.  It didn’t involve sacrifice on anyone’s part except that of the University, which financed the production.  Rumor has it the Projects Board forked over $15,000—and what for?  Since the fashion show only recouped $9000,(3) it looks as if Princeton spent the money as part of a larger effort to train students to give and attend benefits.  And hell, Operation Style is peopled by sorority girls anyway, with diamonds so big in their ears that they droop.  And Teddy van Beuren, but we’ll get to him later. So this year they dropped both the ties to the Operation Smile and any fat people from their show.  Students of all body types were invited to audition, but it seemed as though only girls with BMI’s below 15 were chosen to participate. At least last year they did have that one obese fellow no one had ever seen before—maybe they picked him up on Route 1?—in a sea of anorexic honeys.  He definitely pulled up the average weight.,Anyway, Friday evening wasn’t warm enough to be pleasant outside, but it was hot as hell inside the tent. Robert Wei Wong ’06 insisted upon smoking a cigar on stage and I insist that I could smell it from where I was standing.  They brought out some second-rate student groups to entertain: we had the Footnotes, Naacho, and Raks Odalisque belly dancers.  I’ll be honest: they didn’t really show me much. ,Unlike the entertainers, the models were all top-of-the-line gorgeous: water polo guys, a few football players, unclearly affiliated well-muscled fellows (probably in Cap), a handful of Thetas and Pi Phis and then a bunch of exotic looking types who may or may not have been in diSiac.  They probably weren’t in diSiac, but that’s what they looked like: dark-haired Lolitas of unclear ethnic heritage and thin build.,Categorically I enjoyed the student designers’ participation—authentically communal or democratic or student-participatory; and the designers were good at what they did.  They had some nice dresses and things.  And then the final student designer was a man by the name of TVB. Young TVB didn’t actually make any clothes; I just wanted to clear that up.  He went to a thrift store (rumor has it that it was Red, White, and Blue), and bought some polo shirts, and some jeans, and some blazers.  ,The jeans he just cut off until there was about 4 inches left and didn’t do anything to make them into skirts and then just put them on the girls and their asses were hanging out and the girls wore these with the polo shirts, which he had spattered with paint and/or bleach.  Like a little Jackson Pollock.  The blazers and suit components were also spattered with paint—pink paint, white paint.  There may or may not have been an angel motif with like wings, but I think he must just have gotten lucky with dribbling the paint.,The male models provided meaningful genital work to complement the ass-cheek work of the ladies. Student designer Teddy Van Beuren made particular use of the male package in his concept.  His models came down the runway in clothes he “designed.”  Let me be explicit: by “design,” I mean that he splashed things he bought at Red, White, and Blue with some paint.(4)  He had the models wear these items with just tighty-whitey underpants. There was no explanation.  ,The first group of models, big masculine fellows, walked to the end of the runway and settled the question of the black-white phallus divide forever.  Black men do have bigger penises, and I know because such penises were jiggled in front of the entire audience.  We’re talking a right-handed jiggle: grab package, work it up and down, smile, walk back down the runway. Assuming they did it on their own, though, it was a fine display of camaraderie and male equipment.,TVB really distinguished himself at the end of his set.  Whereas the other student designers had stepped out from behind the back-stage area, given a little wave, received a little cheer from the audience, and retreated into oblivion, Teddy walked all the way down the runway, flanked by two large male models. He was topless, wearing pants of his own design, and sporting what appeared to be a tremendous erection.  I’m not sure what happened, but it looks like he was just so pleased with himself that he spontaneously busted.  At the end of the runway, the boner threatened to violate the integrity of the pants.   ,So he was standing there with his man-servants, one on each side.  One wore tighty-whiteys and a jacket; the other wore tighty-whiteys and a vest.  First the vest-model removed his garment and placed it on TVB, and the jacket-model followed suit.(5)   So they’re standing there mostly naked, and TVB is wearing a full suit of Jacob-Savage-at-a-formal-event light blue fabric spattered in pink paint and he starts doing his best P. Diddy.  He spreads his arms, smiles, flashes peace signs, soaks up the love that everyone has for him, and for his work.  He’ll be missed next year; Princeton will not be the same without him.,Much less enjoyable were the emcees, Robert Wei Wong ’06 and Dara Deshe ’07.(6)  Dara had trouble spitting out the Operation Style necessities: that was hot after a modeling or entertainment segment, and buy a smile at any other time. Also, she didn’t bother to learn the names of the volunteer models.  When they took their curtain calls at the end, she called all the Asian females “CeCe Chang.”(7) The emcees sat on stage in armchairs and blazers and jeans and they sipped fake martinis or maybe the martinis were real but in any event they were in martini glasses.  ,And RWW would light up a cigar.  I’m not sure who was making this sort of creative decision. Actually, since the event chairs all walked the runway at the end of the evening, I could give you a pretty damn good guess.  What I mean is this: I’m not sure what depraved sensibilities governed the benefit.  It wasn’t tasteful, and it wasn’t appropriate for an event that in theory existed for the benefit of poor, disadvantaged people.  What should have been an others-minded community event became the Operation Style show – the organizers’ toast to themselves.,Not to be outdone by fellow UCC member TVB, Lauren Lyon made a splash of her own.  When she first took the stage, ostensibly for the dual purposes of drawing attention to herself and also exhorting the crowd to buy a smile, she took the microphone and asked if anyone had seen the large, black purse that she had lost.  Then she asked the crowd, “Who will stand up right now and donate a whole smile?” A smile costs 750 bucks.  This event was targeted at college students; it’s astoundingly pompous and insensitive to think that a student in the crowd would stand up and pledge. The organizers could have at least pretended that they understood that not everyone is rich.  ,This mode of fundraising also serves to glorify those who donate – again, what happened to tastefulness, sensitivity, anything reasonable at all?  Four adults obliged Ms. Events Chair and stood up.  She looked surprised and delighted (like she had just gotten a pony for Christmas), even though whispers spread through the tent that two of the donors were her parents.(8) An event for a worthy cause dissolved into affluence-mongering, wealth-glorifying, and ass-ogling.,So the University spent $15,000 on a charity event that brought in $9000.  That nets a loss of $4000.(9)  Why didn’t the University just write that $15,000 check to Operation Smile if it cared so much?  Because some girls wanted to put on a show.  So let some rich kids spend other people’s money and put themselves on display for a good cause. Let them put on a fashion show to benefit physically deformed children, for god’s sake.  Let them miss the irony that the deformed children are judged because of their physical appearances. Operation Smile’s beneficiaries are ostracized, they can’t find work—and we stand on the Frist South lawn, lucky judging the lucky.,(1)The event organizer said EVERYONE at the gym is going to be wearing them, just you wait and see.,(2)Too bad it wasn’t Teddy van Buren spinning.  I heard he can spin.,(3)The estimate of $9000 was reported in the Daily Princetonian.  I’m assuming it’s wrong.  I’m also assuming that the figure is too high, as the Prince is in league with all things evil.  ,(4)I could do that.  You know, I could even do better than he did.  He only used pink and white.  I could have used many colors of paint.,(5)Haha! “Suit”: this is a great pun.,(6)Though the Nass does not officially endorse candidates for student government positions, the author would like to throw her weight behind whoever is running against Dara Deshe, even though she heard that he’s in MIMA.,(7)Michael Lohman was not pleased.,(8)Rumor has it that Mommy and Daddy sat separately to give the impression that they gave two individual donations.,(9)The Nass keeps ape cosmonauts with abacuses on hand for just this sort of analysis.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/operation_vile/,"

SOUTH OF THE BORDER,South of the Border is a theme park right off I-95 in Dillon, South Carolina.  It includes restaurants, shopping, hotels, and an amusement park with three arcades.  This assemblage of recreation and hospitality establishments is Mexican-themed, and Pedro, its namesake-cum-mascot and quite possibly its patron saint, wears a moustache and a sombrero and speaks Spanglish on billboards.  The facility boasts two fireworks stores, a leather shop, several brands of gasoline, and a nightclub that opens daily at 5 PM.,While several internet accounts gloss South of the Border as king-kitsch and intentionally campy, I don’t buy it.  The pointy-headed intellectuals and vague hipsters who populate the internet are simply all too eager to dismiss a cultural phenomenon they don’t understand.  112 million people have visited South of the Border…,Whether or not a visitor to South of the Border smells the kitsch on the 200-foot sombrero…,The issue at hand is the potential kitschiness of posting a bumper sticker from the establishment at your place of work.  God forbid the Nass be out-kitsched.  ,II. NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS: WITHOUT ‘EM IT WOULD JUST BE SLEEP?Once my brother had a job and they gave him a pamphlet called “Is This a Career-Limiting Move?” and I think that posting any bumper sticker about semen is probably deemed career-limiting.  This iteration is particularly vulgar, as it fails even to advertise sexual prowess – it seems to feature sperm for sperm’s sake.  It makes you think for a long time about whether adult males have wet dreams – and if they do have wet dreams, are they good enough to celebrate in a bumper sticker?  It has been suggested that masturbation-to-completion counts, too, but I’m not sure that it makes much difference.,Regardless of the specific definition of a night-time emission, suffice it to say the human resource people would probably prefer it wasn’t posted.  It constitutes some sort of harassment.  It’s probably offensive to women, and maybe to men, too.  The sticker is vulgar, unfunny and self-deprecating to the point of indignity – maybe to the point of anti-dignity, where it actually takes away your dignity – where the model is generally along the lines of vulgar, unfunny, and braggartly.,?I have just been informed that the bumper sticker may not be about semen at all.  It might be about farting.,Mr. Frist Package Guy, I want to tell you a few things, in case you’re out there – in case you’re sitting on the toilet in Brown Hall, like the rest of the Nass readership.

"I was struck recently by an editorial in the Daily Princetonian on April 6 in which Ashley Wolf wrote what appeared to be a gang rape apologetic regarding the Duke lacrosse scandal. Forgive her, sort of: Princeton is a complicated place from which to read and watch as this scandal unfolds. We walk among the same “gothic buildings” that the New York Times used in metonymy-slur against Duke students, and most all of the Duke lacrosse team went to high schools that send a number of students to Princeton every year – feeder schools like Delbarton and Landon. Put simply, the students at the center of this level 5 shitstorm are our high school friends and teammates.,This scandal is situated emphatically at the intersection of all things contentious and American. It takes place at a predominantly white university in a former slave state – a ,university founded on a tobacco fortune, in fact. This University has long been regarded romantically – well-nigh glamorously – as a bastion of privilege. In the last twenty-five years though, the University has been working to shed its provincial, vaguely aristocratic image, and indeed its successful rise from a regional school to an elite research university is widely acclaimed and almost universally recognized. Duke has a lot at stake in terms of image-management.,Durham, North Carolina has not grown up around Duke the way one might expect a university town to grow. It’s still a largely working-class community, relatively poor, and equally split between white people and black people. It’s a community where the inheritance of slavery is still immediate – a place where you can imagine a white man saying, “Thank your grandpa for my cotton shirt!” to a black woman, as a lacrosse player reportedly did – and from the porch, for Christ’s sake.,All of this placing makes for a singularly American story –American like OJ Simpson, or maybe like Michael Jackson’s postmodern tragic mulatto saga. It’s somewhat beyond the “only in America” designation that always seems to be attached to Don King and theme parks and stuff – this is an encounter not only shaped but enabled by its location. You cannot discount the primacy of place, not even for a second. The generalized public of this absurd America tends to confound issues of class and race, and of sex and violence – and in Durham we have all four in play: rich and poor, white and black, man and woman, extensive bruising. It’s all knotted together,,Given this remarkable combination of grave implication and sensationalist detail, an hour’s incident has become a cultural watershed before our very eyes. You can see the media-motor start to whirr, but this isn’t Natalee Holloway. It’s not just Nancy Grace or Geraldo; this time, the response is coming from across the spectrum of respectability. The story made the front-page of yahoo.com – it’s been taken up in the blogosphere, in New York Times op-eds; the University has issued statements and has installed several inquiry committees that will publish more – it is being analyzed, debriefed, bemoaned…in short, it is being recorded.,While I won’t deny the staying power of artificial fingernails (broken off) or championship seasons (cancelled), it seems to me that the Duke story has held our national attention for reasons apart from sordid details and shock value. In “Sentimental Journeys,” an essay published in the New York Review of Books and then in a collection called After Henry in 1992, Joan Didion writes that “crimes are universally understood to be news to the extent that they offer, however erroneously, a story, a lesson, a high concept.” This tendency is played out hard and fast here – especially because the purported facts of the case lend themselves so easily to American typing. It almost isn’t to be believed… rich, white, good-looking prep-school meatheads; a black single mother working her way through a historically-black college., If you feel like you’ve seen this movie, you probably have. It was called The Skulls; it was also sort of called School Ties, and Scent of a Woman. In fact, the book has already been written. Tom Wolfe addressed this sort of despicable WASP character in Bonfire of the Vanities, the athlete of sexual appetite in A Man in Full, and he went ahead and pretty much wrote the whole megillah in I Am Charlotte Simmons – a fact that has not escaped the notice of the New York Times and Associated Press, among others, where Wolfe’s description of the fictional Dupont University lacrosse team has been all but projected onto Duke’s players.,The entire typology can be described as the preppy-on-a-rampage, and I think it has something to do with the Kennedys. America’s collective obsession with that first family of American glamour trickled down into a ravenous appetite for all things preppy, white, East Coasty and privileged; when John Jr. went to Brown, so did America’s tabloid interest – its hunger for sensational and racy and filthy stories landed squarely before the ivory tower – at Van Wickle Gate, probably.,Joan Didion observed the preppy-on-a-rampage typology in action in the 1986 Central Park murder of Jennifer Levin by Robert Chambers – included in the “Sentimental Journeys” essay. She wrote that the story imposed on the case, “largely extrapolated out of thin air but left largely uncorrected,” was that of preppies-running-amuck, of over-indulgence on the Upper East Side. Despite the rather profound untruth of the characterization, the case came to be called the Preppy Murder, and the name – and concept – stuck around.,Having been informed by prejudiced generations of black-on-white, poor-on-rich crime stories, we no longer seek to impose that narrative on our news. In Didion’s conception, those stories are no longer news because they no longer offer “a high concept.” By now we’ve heard that lesson so many times that we’ve passed the point of saturation; it is no longer compelling. We (some mythical, normative, news-receiving majority, I mean) know all about our societal vestiges of racism; we’ve addressed our inherent sense of the taboo of relations between white women and black men. Attention is paid to the converse situation – rampaging members of the privileged classes, perpetrating bloody injustice on a member of an underserved group. We’re no longer collectively, psychically compelled to impose the old narrative on our news stories. Instead, in our state of informed, liberal, post-Katrina injustice-seeking, we’re reading for the other story. We’re reading for the story that shows our sensitivity and also reveals the depravity of the privileged classes, and maybe also diagnoses a generalized ‘what’s wrong with America’.,In the case of the 1989 Central Park jogger rape, Didion identified that “one reason the victim…could be so readily abstracted, and her situation so readily made to stand for that of the city itself, was that she remained, as a victim of rape, unnamed in most press reports.” The same is true now in Durham: the alleged victim remains nameless (it is not the policy of the Associated Press to name alleged victims of sexual assault), and details of her identity have been tailored to fit a sympathetic template. Here, though, the boys are largely unnamed, too. The roster has been taken down from the Duke athletics website – and while some in the blogosphere have taken it upon themselves to post the roster – the general feeling is that the team deserves some protection of anonymity. Here again is a postmodern development, informed by a guilty sense of the necessary culpability of the man with the upper-hand in a given power dynamic – we almost recognize the fallibility of our justice-enacting impatience. ,At this writing the players’ DNA tests have been completed, but the results have not been released. Suspended as we are in this moment of pure speculation – and thus of extrapolation, the wheels are turning and the narrative is being written and we’re here in the chasm and perhaps we can stop and look around. I am writing here from what Joan Didion calls the “chasm,” from the distance between “actual life and its preferred narratives.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/preppiesonarampage/,"

"John Cameron Mitchell’s new film Shortbus raises a lot of difficult questions. For example, if A is fellating B, B is fellating C, and C is fellating A, is A fellating C? Is A fellating himself? Because that is, as I have learned, possible with serious dedication to yoga. Shortbus, Mitchell’s follow-up film to Hedwig and the Angry Inch, came to campus last weekend to share with us a lot of heart and a lot of hard-ons. But this was no mere screening, because the Pride Alliance and Alcohol Initiative joined forces to bring not just the scratched DVD but also two musicians from the film to perform at Terrace Club last Friday night.  Watching the film was an intense experience. We crowded into the Terrace lower living room, couches pulled up around a makeshift screen. I was uncomfortable in the front row, afraid that people could see my reactions and aware that these two musicians were a few yards away.  Shortbus is not great cinema, but it’s good. If you let yourself get into it—wait, not that far, creep—it’s really good. The film weaves together three stories of sexually frustrated New Yorkers whose lives intersect at Shortbus, “a salon for the sexually gifted and challenged.” Our cast of characters include a sex therapist who has never achieved orgasm, a long-term gay couple burdened by one guy’s severe depression, and a lonely dominatrix, isolated in her hatred of the world. The movie was funny and sad and jaw-droppingly explicit, covering nothing and simulating little. Threesomes in acrobatic positions, rooms full of everywhichwayscrewing, and a reminder from the Shortbus madam that reached out and slapped me from behind the fourth wall: “Voyeurism is participation.”  As a movie, it did what I like my movies to do: entertain me, smartly. Some of the effects were hokey, which was fine, but the ending wrapped up too neatly for an opus on misery and loneliness. Because in the end, that was a lot of what we were watching: sad people looking for companionship and finding copulation, filling the holes in their lives with delusions and other people’s body parts.  Normally, you’d be able to desensitize yourself to a sensory orgy like this. By bringing cast members to campus, however, the organizers of this event made a largely successful attempt to actually make Princeton students feel something. When the film finished, we were treated with moving performances by Scott Matthew, who performs behind many of the movie’s crucial scenes, and Jay Brennan, a secondary character in the film who plays a song in one of the scenes. Matthew’s set was eerie and subtle, replaying for us many of the songs we had just heard. Imagine a piece sung by a guarded and thickly bearded man serenading Terrace with the soundtrack to a pornographic tragedy.  Eerie became surreal when Brennan took the floor. Unlike Matthew, Brennan was a character who we had just seen perform numerous explicit sex acts as a young addition to the abovementioned depressed gay duo. Under its smiling veneer, his performance was heartbreaking. The movie was created with and around its actors, using their own experiences as fodder for the script. Brennan is twenty-four; the movie was three years in the making. So we were left with the surreal experience of listening to a young man whom we had just watched in a quite explicit role, singing his sweet little heart out.  His songs were crushingly depressive and surprisingly clever, unfolding with the prescision of prose poetry and the devastation of perfect comic timing.  But the Brennan who emerged between songs was no tortured soul but a caricature of a diva-queen and an excited, wide-eyed kid with an endearing lisp. “I’ve never been to Princeton before,” he said, his smile revealing the gap between his front teeth. “It’s weird.”  And it was weird. At the close of his set, Brennan asked us if he could sing a protest song, whether here at Princeton we did that hippy-liberal-angry thing. We don’t, but we let him sing it anyway. I was staggered. Brennan systematically worked through all of the social unniceties of our dear America, criticizing them each explicitly and incisively. Because of my view of the general political indifference I see on campus, my reaction to this song was stronger than anything I saw in the film. In his clear and perfectly-pitched voice, Brennan sang out against all the injustices that are glossed over as just, wandering so far left I thought he’d made it back to Berkeley. No one clapped or shouted encouragement, but when his ballad’s apostrophe to suffering ended with a call to “the boys who were told to act more like boys/And the girls who were told to play only with girl toys/The voiceless, forgotten, plagued by disease,” concluding, “God help us, please”—well, it hit me.  Shortbus was sad but it was fun and frivolous, too, and on its own I could have left feeling perfectly fine. But with Jay Brennan sitting in front of me with his acoustic guitar, declaring that “I’m doing this my way instead of the music industry’s way,” I felt shrouded in futility. Brennan’s songs were simple, but they were pure and beautiful; as we watched I could feel people around me aching for him, the room thick with terrible yearning to enter others’ sadness. I looked at Brennan, wondering what he thought of us.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/hop_on/,"

"People – especially dopey, two-months-behind-the-times columnists like the New Yorker’s Sasha Frere-Jones – love making sweeping pronouncements about the nature of hip-hop. Music is a manifestation of the human creative spirit; it is born of a whole slew of political and economic circumstances. Duh. In that way it possesses import both psychological and societal. But music is also a business. And sometimes music is about business. And sometimes that business is pushing weight. Is this even interesting?,Backtrack to the seventies. More than a few long-haired rockers subscribed to the notion that drugs were transcendent, that wild-’n’-tawdry weeklong peyote binges in Topanga Canyon could inspire word-art that could inspire twenty-minute noise collages, which became soundtracks for semi-flaccid love. Drugs were a part of the process, and that explained why the final products were often so impenetrable, bloated, and irrelevant. When does wide-eyed experimental lyricism become just – well – stoner-speak? ,This, of course, is not coke rap. You don’t have to do any coke to produce this stuff. In fact, it’s probably advisable that you don’t. Check out this bit from Clipse’s “Mr. Me Too”:,Listen haters, I doin’ deals like the majors,Ice Cream sneakers, I signed my first skater,So you can pay three and buy yourself some Bapestas,Bulletproof on the T-shirts because they hate us,Dude like Snoop say “Step yo’ game up”,Double the Cabo, Mediterrain’ up,D class-action cuts, tuck your chain up,Liberachi fingers, just hit Lorraine up,Note the feminine rhyme and sublime ear in the last four lines, especially the neologism “Medditerrain’ up.” I don’t know what it means, but I see a palazzo, Chianti, and several gorgeous women. These guys are setting up symbols then tearing them down. Our understanding of coke rap begins here.,Clipse’s Terrence and Gene Thornton, known by the sobriquets Pusha-T and Malice, have more or less spearheaded the movement. Or, more aptly put, they have capitalized mightily upon a whole suite of drug-trade, “street-wise,” and consumerist tropes swirling around in the 21st-century aether. Coke rap focuses not on innovation but rather on tight-as-a-harp-string jabs within a given set of parameters. Maybe that’ why it’s so baffling to critics like Frere-Jones, who insists upon situating Clipse’s work within a milieu of unrelated and unironic idiot-pop. He offers this: ,“When Keith Richards fell out of a coconut tree in Fiji last April and injured his head, the incident was greeted by jokes about whether there was much left inside his skull to harm. TV shows like VH1′s “Behind the Music” thrive on stories of musicians on drug binges, snorting lines off recording-studio consoles.”,By Frere-Jones’s way of thinking, Clipse – and their likeminded comrades Ghostface, Young Jeezy, and Lil’ Wayne – have taken up the decadent mantle of their snow-rawk forbears. But they’re on the supply-side, and this industry has its consequences. Note how Malice characterizes the Great Beyond in “The Funeral”:,Malice was true to the game for 9 innings -,We love sinnin – but now I answer for that,Apologize to my fame I got y’all dressing in black,A long line family and friends signin’ in,My niece singin’, solo organs and violin,Wife in her black veil hands flooded with diamonds,Remaining calm under each arm, my children ,Daddy’s in a better place entering golden doors,With ivory, all-white pillars and marble floors,Brand new physical frame with no flaws,On my throne that’s guarded by angels with 4-4′s ,As the first line indicates, Clipse is embedded in a tradition, but hardly one of unfocused partydom. Hip-hop is a game; that is, hip-hop forces the artist to tailor rhyme, social relevance, and the hook to realities of an overarching business model. This stuff has got to sell. Malice admits that his group “loves sinnin’” and is prepared for the consequences. But what kind of Heaven do we find? Something out of Scarface. Taking Montana’s stylized fall-from-grace to newly divine heights, post-death Malice is just as he was, only bulkier, better protected, hanging out in sweeter digs.,So coke rap’s not about drugs. Then why has the motif taken root? I have a few guesses.,For one thing, cocaine acts on the body and mind in certain easily-replicated and identified ways. The drug embodies the sort of cold, calculated euphoria accountants, academics, and ravers can really get behind – divvied up by line, it dispenses with hippie-era notions of ‘community’ and makes a drug purchase just like a CD purchase. Queue up, pay up, get your fix. Clipse has succeeded in underscoring that link. We can’t even know how many keys they’ve sold, but we know exactly what they’ve bought – yachts, Bathing Ape hoodies, gold houses. We take note of the conspicuous consumption and interpolate a criminal-mythical backstory. Much of coke rap’s allure is predicated on the listener’s willingness to make this leap.,And let’s face it: llallo gives the lyricist a lot of latitude. As Frere-Jones points out (somewhat heavy-handedly), Clipse have developed their own argot. And why not? Feast:,So much glamour, that I can’t stand the,Bright from the ice, chain Xenon lamp yo,Depression in yo’ mind like a free-frame camera,The white-tape tight like ya seen on pampers,What’s under the couch? Probably freeze up Santa,Whatever it cost baby we got answers,Line outside full of Jo-Jo dancers,“We Got It for Cheap” that’s the Re-Up anthem ,Cocaine-as-trope is shellacked over the work’s fundamental thematic elements. These cuts aren’t just for dealers – in fact, they’re probably not for dealers at all. They’re not even intended especially for illicit-drug consumers. Rather, it’s a question as old as the middle-school playground: do you get it? That is to say, are you willing to hear ‘cocaine’ and substitute any number of realities concerning the urban male condition? The real issue is not a prolonged desensitization to the sound of ‘coke’ in your headphones, but a one-time, upfront acknowledgment that coke equals respect equals life.,Thus the true nature of the cocaine-rap phenomenon reveals itself. In the self-termed ‘independent music’ press, Clipse and Ghostface have received significant, occasionally bombastic acclaim – especially for acts signed to major-label subsidiaries. The tight-jeans set loves this whole scene, and the interplay between urban hipsterdom and the rappers themselves cannot be ignored. Just this winter Pusha and Malice headlined a show at a Bowery-owned New York venue. Pitchfork, the online music blogozine that has broken pop-rock darlings Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! and the Arcade Fire, awaited the group’s most recent , with bated breath. ,Nowhere is this symbiosis more pronounced than in the recent Girl Talk mash-up of Clipse’s “Wamp Wamp (What It Do)” with the Grizzly Bear track “Knife.” The latter outfit is an exercise of the current indie rock soft-loud-soft formula; a plodding baseline and wall-of-sound moan build a trampoline for Pusha’s nasal attack. “Me hesitate none pop ya,” he declares with relish, and Grizzly Bear are right along with him. Add to this the overwhelming crossover appeal of Girl Talk (whose melding of Top-40′s glimmering generalities to college radio’s earnest tunefulness deserves its own examination), and you begin to see just how well coke rap and skinny boys can get along.,The question inevitably becomes sociological. Coke rap is content with its leitmotifs, its players, its turns-of-phrase. Those who spotted the trend early enough have made it big, and plenty more hangers-on will eventually suck the marrow out. We might take this moment to tout the unity of modern music, its ability to cross racial and socioeconomic lines in order to further some notion of artistic togetherness. But that kind of celebration is meaningless and, in the end, false. A lack of rigorous formal introspection – that same malaise permitting two hundred Shins clones in a two year span – afflicts Ghostface and his crew. At a Clipse show in Brooklyn, everyone displays the same commodity fetishes; everyone might even sport the same despicable chin-beard or other such nonsense. But at the end of the night, after the lights have gone down, the vast majority of the room heads back to Williamsburg or LES, while the entire movement’s generative presence lies farther east, beyond the gentrified frontiers. ,It’s the kind of duality even well-intentioned musicheads are loath to acknowledge. Guys like Pusha and Malice don’t deserve the blame. But the members of Clipse aren’t making illegal deals anymore, if they ever did. Younger kids take that business, and they can’t afford the jazzy ironic trappings. Coke rap requires, more than anything else, a comfortable distance from the horrors of the real-world drug trade. It is a distance easily forgotten or ignored.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/total_clipse_of_the_heart/,"

"Two dark autumns ago, the Arcade Fire made me believe, all over again, in the all-encompassing power of rock and roll.  Those were depressingly political times, and the un-political nature of the record offered me an escape.  “Funeral” was a triumphant album about loss and renewal, about picking up the pieces in a cold, wintry world; it made me feel that I wasn’t the only one who was strung out and sad and suddenly and pathetically sober. But though it attempts a similarly bombastic sound, “Neon Bible” – the Arcade Fire’s long-awaited follow-up – has none of “Funeral’s” guarded optimism.  And bombast without uplift is a recipe for disaster. ,“Neon Bible” certainly sounds like the Arcade Fire: the thudding 4/4 beat, the grand orchestral moments, Win Butler’s cracking vocals. Yet the transcendent nostalgia of “Funeral” is entirely gone, replaced by a meandering, dystopic, and deeply flawed meditation on the imminent collapse of the Western world. ,In much of the album, the orchestration seems forced, as the Arcade Fire are intent on preserving “Funeral’s” sound, though not its spirit. “Black Mirror,” the poorly placed first track, is marred by an off-kilter violin that immediately throws off the bass-driven melody.  “Antichrist Television Blues” could have been a terrific, stripped-down, Springsteen-type rocker.  Instead, it insists on being something more, and a wailing group chorus and string section almost ruin it entirely.   ,When I get bored with an album, I sometimes play Guess the Next Lyric with myself.   I’ve never been able to predict an Arcade Fire lyric – never wanted to, really – until I put on “Neon Bible.” The Arcade Fire are surprisingly and grotesquely into rhyming, and the results are tired and predictable, with none of the exuberance of “Funeral” (“sometimes we remember bedrooms / in our parents’ bedrooms / the bedrooms of our friends” – does it get better than that?).  With lyrics like “World War III / when are you coming for me,” the band is left grasping at straws.  Nothing, however, quite beats the apocalyptic banality of “Black Mirror”: “Mirror mirror on the wall / show me where the bombs will fall.”  Are they kidding?  Worse, are they serious?,With “The Well and the Lighthouse” and “Intervention,” we see how this album might have turned out.  “The Well and the Lighthouse” is vintage Arcade Fire; Reginne Chassagne’s eerie harmonies build up the song until a familiar violin slows it down, as Win Butler segues into a heartbreaking mantra: “The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet.” ,On “Intervention,” the album’s first single, the initial organ theme is swelling and triumphant; when the band kicks in around minute two, it becomes anthemic.  Like many of “Funeral’s” best songs, “Intervention” tells something of a story:  a man in service to the Church loses track of the things that once meant most to him and allows his family to die.   This is a song of grandiose promise that fully warrants its grandiose orchestration.,Yet “Neon Bible” consistently falls short.  Unlike “Funeral” – whose exuberant mix of piano, organ, and violin remains one of the unique rock and roll sounds of the decade –  much of “Neon Bible” is plainly derivative.  With its two-word choral repetition and descending bass-line, the title track sounds (and reads) like a low-fi, boring version of The Notwist’s “Neon Golden.” “Ocean of Noise” opens like a mediocre Pixies track, employing faux-haunting guitar fills to little effect. On “Keep the Car Running,” it wouldn’t be surprising to find out that The Edge has secretly taken up the mandolin at an Arcade Fire charity benefit.  And on the lovely “No Cars Go,” the Arcade Fire steal from an all too familiar source: themselves. ,“No Cars Go” – originally released on their self-titled EP – is the Arcade Fire at their best: childish, winsome, and above all, moving.  It’s a story of youthful escape: “We know a place where no planes go / we know a place where no ships go / hey! No cars go.”  Listening to the song repackaged only compounds “Neon Bible’s” disappointment, as this playful and poignant whimsy doesn’t mesh with the tone of the rest of the album; it seems like a last-ditch Hail Mary to save an otherwise weak effort.  We can’t help but think: this might have been an album filled with songs like “No Cars Go.”  Instead we are left with opaque and unfulfilled reflections on the apocalyptic nature of American imperialism.,“Neon Bible’s” shortcomings are not surprising – it’s very difficult to make a successful political record.  By their very nature, the best political albums tend to be anti-political; they make personal statements in the wake of overwhelming social alienation.   I know I live in an increasingly frightening and dystopic world.  I listen to music to escape from that world.  And by trying to say too much, “Neon Bible” says nothing to me about my life.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/grandiose_gestures/,"

"Some years back, while browsing The Adventures of Pete and Pete fan sites (I obviously had lots of friends in high school), I happened upon one that listed the AIM screennames of several actors who played big roles on the show. I dutifully added the names to my buddy list – here were my true friends! – and waited patiently for the chance to badger them. That chance finally came one afternoon when older Pete’s friend Bill signed on, after months of inactivity. “What if you could be rich forever, but you had to go to the bathroom out your nose? Would you do it?” I asked (conundrums of this sort were Bill’s trademark on the show).   The response was slightly more caustic than I had hoped for: “Listen punk, if you ever talk to me again I’ll come to your house with a box full of burning hot French fries and jam them into your eyeballs one by one!” Though scarring on a personal level, this exchange has done nothing to diminish my fondness for the series itself.  It’s really a wonder that Pete and Pete ever got on TV in the first place. Probably best described as a cross between Twin Peaks and The Wonder Years, the show chronicled the exploits of the Wrigley brothers (both with red hair, both named Pete) and the bizarre cast of characters they encountered in their hometown of Wellsville. Wellsville was a town suffused with surrealism, where incidents like the accidental lamination of pets or the freeze-drying of Cuba as a practical joke were commonplace. Punk rock legend Iggy Pop was a regular character as the father of younger Pete’s friend Nona. A motley collection of other celebrities made cameos during the show’s three season run as well – LL Cool J  (a math teacher), Steve Buscemi (a guidance counselor), and NFL Hall-of-Famer Art Donovan (himself), to name a few. It also had a fantastic soundtrack, populated by indie groups like The Magnetic Fields and The Apples in Stereo.  All of these quirks help to explain how Pete and Pete has developed a semblance of a cult following in the years since it has gone off the air – they make for great rewatchability – but it remains unclear exactly what kids liked so much about this show in the first place. I’m certain I didn’t know quite what I was laughing at in elementary school when, for instance, a bus driver feeling betrayed in the aftermath of Career Day, screams at older Pete, “Carrot top Judas! Thou hast forsaken me!” or when younger Pete finds Jimmy Hoffa’s wallet while digging a tunnel out of his house.   Ultimately, though, all the historical references and surrealist humor existed within what was a pretty conventional framework. Narratives were driven by all the familiar tropes of adolescent TV: the school bully, the unreasonable teacher, the awkward courtship with the girl next door. It moralized everything in an unchallenging way, gradually acquiring a more serious tinge in the second and third seasons as older Pete negotiated the familiar path through high school. Every show ended with gentle guitar and thoughtful narration from older Pete, as he hashed out in clear terms whatever life lesson it was that the audience was supposed to be taking away from the episode. When you consider Pete and Pete in these terms, it’s tempting to write it off as a potentially original show stifled within a tired genre. It’s certainly true that there are constraints imposed by setting and format on the show, but such is the nature of the beast; after all, your typical childhood in the suburbs doesn’t allow for a great deal of thematic variety, particularly when it’s portrayed in half hour intervals.  But all this isn’t to say that Pete and Pete was trite or unoriginal. What gives the show its enduring value was its understanding of its limits. The talent of the writers lay in taking simple narrative ideas – there’s little you can do in a format like this that hasn’t already been done – and working from there to make the finished product as distinctive as possible. Often, episodes of Pete and Pete boiled down simply to battles between good and evil. Evil on the show took a variety of unusual forms. Bullies with supervillian-like characteristics—and names like Paper Cut, Pit Stain, and Endless Mike—harassed the Wrigley brothers on a daily basis. Meanwhile adults of all stripes – occasionally under the auspices of the “International Adult Conspiracy” – constantly endeavored to crush the spirit of youth in one way or another. In other cases, the Petes dealt with problems like boring family vacations or impossible tests. With the help of Artie, their personal super hero, Pete and Pete engaged in compelling struggles which, without the inventiveness of the show’s writers, would have been decidedly tedious.  Certainly, the surreal elements of the show have always held it back from universal acclaim – after all, your average Step by Step fan wasn’t going to laugh at jokes about bowling balls with supernatural powers or a bear that almost gets elected to the House of Representatives. But it was the happy marriage between the surreal and the quotidian that made Pete and Pete a classic. The humor of the show was so effective because of its juxtaposition of otherwise unfamiliar situations. The narrative, meanwhile, was checked from becoming cloying and sappy by the subversive elements of the show—the biting irony, the stinging sarcasm. As a result, kids could enjoy and relate to the show’s characters without feeling self-conscious or suspicious. The characters themselves were exceptionally well-drawn – the sentimental, impressionable older Pete and the courageous, free-spirited younger Pete – and despite the socially undercutting elements, the show was fundamentally good-hearted. It’s little wonder, then, that this show has proved so endearing for its select following of fans. Seasons one and two have been released on DVD, while the petition to get season three released is twenty-five hundred strong. I can make a variety of considered arguments these days as to why The Adventures of Pete and Pete is one of the great children’s TV shows of all time. When I watched it as a kid, of course, this wasn’t the case, but I loved it probably for little else than that I wished my life were more like the show, that I could do things like ride my bike across four states, dig a tunnel out of my house, or accidentally topple the Asian bond market. When you’re talking about a children’s TV show, though, what criteria is more revealing than that?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/bite_my_scab_blowhole2/,"

His penchant for vomiting and urinating on room furniture, irrational refusal to chip in any money for room furnishings, and obscenely loud early morning routine disqualify him from that.  Not to mention the time his roommates had to console a crying female companion of Ryan’s because he had inexplicably begun patting her on the head repeatedly and cooing “cutesy pies” in her ear.  It can’t be because he has been the model family man.  His parents have disowned him and his younger brother is permanently banned from an eating club.

He only narrowly avoided expulsion for email fraud and identity theft because his major opponent on the disciplinary council was diagnosed with cancer the day of the trial.  He’s currently on probation for alcohol violations, harassment, and file sharing of The Italian Job.  OIT fired him from their services for a clear pattern of only assisting freshmen girls with attractive facebook pictures, as well as emails to the entire RCA training program complaining about the lack of hot OIT assistants.  I would say his romantic endeavors earn him something but the girl he put in a headlock in a Miami club and the club’s bouncers might not agree. Ryan Foss doesn’t deserve an issue for any reason whatsoever but it might be funny anyway. ,William Wachter ‘08,It is my sincere pleasure to recommend William Wachter ’08 for your “single kid” issue. While Will is a relatively unknown freshman (a mere 34 views on the Princeton Online Facebook), I truly believe that he would provide more than enough material for an entire Nass issue.  The following is list of cool things I know about Will Wachter:,1) The Princeton Facebook Agency did a poor job cropping his photo,(regrettably, they made him look a little like former Washington Bullets’ center and “My Giant” star Gheorghe Muresan — whom he doesn’t even resemble in real life).,2) In fact, rather than Gheorghe Muresan, he looks like John Cusack. Some of his friends actually call him “Cusack,” which annoys him.,3) He is a stand-up comic.,4) He is in charge of scheduling for the Whig-Cliosophic Society, a position he is in because he loves “power.”,5) He wants to get a PhD for one reason: to be known as Doctor Wachter.,6) He is from New Jersey, but originally from Louisiana.,This kid is fascinating; there is way more to be discovered. You could give him his big break. Do not pass up this opportunity to create a star.,Ivana King ’08 ,Haha, this sounds so funny so I thought what the hell, might as well give it a try. Let’s see, I have 7 roommates and I’m on the varsity tennis team. That’s like the trivial stuff, why should the Nassau be devoted to me? Hmm, good question. Um because not that many people can say that they graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School, high school to Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Warren G (I ‘m pretty sure Warren went there), as well as Cameron Diaz, and Billy Jean King. Yeah, pretty ghetto, though I don’t think I should really be proud of that. (the ghetto-ness, that is).  Some might get offended, ah well. It’s the truth. Um, we had the most NFL players come from our high school out of all the high schools in the country in 2004 (http://www.nflhs.com/News/Features/2004NFLRosters_10132004_sim.asp ),Okay less school, more me. Gee, can’t say much academically, wasn’t really into the DECA and math club/science stuff . . Yet ironically I’m here at Princeton. What can I say, Princeton likes a little diversity now and then, just kidding. I’m kinda crazy, not as in lets go see if drinking while intoxicating is fun, but more like, I talk a mile a minute, really hyper kinda girl. For the first few weeks, if ppl see me, they’ll think I’m just another quiet girl. It’s only if they know me, do they know just how loco I can be. Crazy sleeping schedule (sleep during day, work during night, though I’m changing it because it kinda puts a damper on my tennis especially since it is season right now-you’ve prolly guessed that I’ve missed a lot of classes), anime freak, lazy as hell, etc . . .,So.… reason? I think I’m a unique sorta individual with an interesting background as a varsity athlete (only 4’11″) who has the energy of the EnergyBunny and went to a public school that had the fortune to be the host to Snoop Dogg (drop it like it’s hot!) and other famous athletes (yeah powerhouse in sports esp. football) like Gene Washington, Willie McGinest, Tony Gwynn, Stanford’s Chris Lewis as well as actress Cameron Diaz, and Billie Jean King.,WILL RYAN FOSS, WILL WACHTER, OR IVANA KING BE THE NASSAU WEEKLY’S SINGLE KID?

"I am starting at the port-wine stain on Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev’s forehead that starts near the top of his receded hairline and drips in its forked way partly down toward his eyebrows. Technically, this is called a naevus flammeus, which is a huge congenital hicky, a vascular birthmark made of dilated capillaries which makes the skin off-color – probably more red than purple in this case. ,This is the man who melted the Cold War. This is the man who led the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991. This is the man who signed two broad disarmament pacts and ended communist rule in Eastern Europe.  This is also the man who did a Pizza Hut commercial in 1997.,But what was he doing in the Trenton, New Jersey on Monday afternoon?,The whole scenario sounds like the set up for a joke: a former General Secretary (President) of the Soviet Union, on a Monday afternoon, in the Sovereign Bank Arena, across from the Trenton Industrial Center and a river-line metro that takes passengers from the slums of New Jersey’s capital to the slums of Camden. ,At the time of his speech, Gorbachev had been in the United States for 10 days in the Trenton area, of which (he claimed) he approved.  He spoke excitedly of his visiting the place on the Delaware River where Washington crossed on Christmas night of 1776 to fight for independence from England.  This struck a sound cord within a man who has seen oppression, lived through wars hot and cold, and come to value America as a vital force in the world.,In Trenton, within rusted rail-guards on highways and brick walls and people with doo-rags smoking cigarettes and sagging their pants on street corners, the crowd inside the arena awaited Gorbachev.  Though a famous bridge in the surrounding area spells out “Trenton Makes, The World Takes,” postcards inside the arena (ironically, I hope) had written “Trenton Makes, Moscow Takes.”,Though stern in his masculine Russian manner, Gorbachev relaxed with the crowd and spoke of his culinary undertakings during this particular stay in New Jersey.  In clear, distinct Russian, Gorbachev spoke though a translator of his pleasant meals in Trentonian Italian restaurants and added that though the food was good, it was served in “American portions.”  Ever the politician, Gorbachev roused the residual crowd in laughter as he gave the large portions credit for bolstering American agriculture.,Gorbachev is neither the monster of Lenin or Stalin, in whose madness and power we in the West have a twisted fascination. He is not Peter The Great, a majestic, mythical man in Russian history who was known to dress in peasant rags and travel through port cities to hear what the people were saying and plan his political aims accordingly. Gorbachev is neither Krushchev nor Brezhnev; he never had the difficult task of following the carnage and corruption of Stalin’s regime.,Gorbachev, who sought to end the Cold War, inadvertently ended the political hegemony of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and led to the collapse of the Soviet Union itself.  Though viewed with scorn by Russians, those in the West admire Gorbachev for his efforts of perestroika (government “restructuring”), glasnost (political “openness”), and uskorenie (“acceleration,” of economic development), initiatives Gorbachav launched in 1986.,On Monday, Gorbachev spoke of his first interaction with Reagan.  The leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union had not met in six years, and as such, chose the neutral ground of Switzerland, of halcyon political past.  “This guy is a real dinosaur,” Gorbachev said of the fortieth president of the United States, and Reagan is said to have told his staff that he believed Gorbachev to be “a diehard Bolshevik.”  Nevertheless, the two formed one of the most intriguing and pleasant political relations of the twentieth century.,In the seven years given him to transform Mother Russia, Gorbachev believed he could weave beautifully—warp and woof—democracy into the Soviet system.  He established a Congress of People’s Deputies in 1998, and he signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty in 1987 with Reagan. During his time, he ended the Russian military occupation of Afghanistan in 1988 and sought to normalize relations with Europe and China. He admitted there “were flaws with human rights” in the Soviet system	,Gorbachev spoke of his steadfast belief in perestroika, and insisted that if his reforms had not been terminated after just six years, Russia today would be a more stable and democratic state.,This Russian leader, this Russian leader of the world, this leader placed for an afternoon in Trenton, banged his hand on the podium and declared, “Perestroika triumphed, perestroika won, even though it was interrupted.”,Gorbachev criticized Boris Yeltsin, who took over power in 1991, for failing to embrace the world in Russia’s restructuring.  Yeltsin, according to Gorbachev, abandoned the help of others and tried to man Russia alone, with corruption and adulteration of the perestroika the last Soviet leader had sought. According to Gorbachev, Yeltsin put the economy through “shock therapy” through haphazard “cowboy methods.” Always with charismatic charm, Gorbachev added, “ But when in America I have to careful when I say this, because cowboys are good people.”,The Russian leader, with light shining on the right side of his face and the birthmark in shadows on the left, looked into the crowd and declared: “How is it that a person from…a remote Russian village in the caucuses…35 kilometers from the nearest railway station could rise to such power?” Indeed, Gorbachev came from a family of illiterate peasants, but he was able to graduate with honors from high school and what he deemed “the most important, best” university in Russia – Moscow University – where he studied law. Gorbachev described himself as “naturally ambitious,” adding, “Without ambition and self-esteem, you should not go into politics.”,Having joined the CPSU in 1952, it is perhaps no coincidence that he married his wife in 1953; perhaps communism is attractive in nuptial affairs.  Bah to whoever said, “Better off dead than red.” Gorbachev’s career was catapulted further as he specialized in and became First Secretary for Agriculture in 1970 and was made a member of the Central Committee the following year. He continued to move through the Soviet ranks until March 11, 1985, when he was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party at 54.,In the Sovereign Bank Arena, Gorbachev spoke of his feeling that Vladimir Putin, who took over for Yeltsin in 2001, stabilized the country from ten years of Yeltsin’s “reckless adventure…and disintegration of the Russian Federation.” Gorbachev believes that Russia must take a slow steady process to capitalism.,In his stately but chic dark suit and sky blue shirt in consonance with his dark blue tie, Gorbachev raised his hand to his clouds of trim Cool Whip hair and spoke about the high expectations for Russian capitalism.,“We Russians may be talented, but you created a democracy in two hundred years, and you want us to create a democracy in two hundred days?” he questioned. “Only God could create the world in seven days. Do not overestimate our abilities.”,Gorbachev also admonished the United States for its cavalier tactics in world diplomacy, specifying the war in Iraq.  “You cannot be democratic within your own country when you act according to the law of the jungle with regard to other countries,” he said.  Describing the need for concentration on the common, global interest, Gorbachev urged America to gain approval from the United Nations.  He believes in serving the world, but cautions the use of force.  “Democracy cannot be imposed by point of bayonet or nuclear weapons…You shouldn’t equate humanitarian intervention with the use of force.” He looked out to the audience and said, “I ask of you, the American people: are you enthusiastic about being a global policeman?”,With Bush and Putin both in their second terms, Gorbachev sees opportunity for the two countries to unite and never regress to the tension existing during the Cold War.  “I would hope the second term of Putin will be used to start a broad based movement for economic growth,” he said. “I always speak very candidly to American groups…and in our relationship, the best is yet to come.”,Still, the question remains: why was Gorbachev in Trenton on Monday?  Did he come for the rubles or the dollars?  He now heads the International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies (Gorbachev Foundation) and the environmental organization Green Cross International, so he needs money to give money.  Whatever his ulterior mercenary motives, Gorbachev laid down his gavel of judgment on the past and his perspicuous advice for the future.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/gorbachev_in_trenton/,"

"It takes an impresario to found a Russian movement.,But for a moment’s continued interest in the present, a queer and inexplicable slavophilia must appear to have its dance with history. And now, 15 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, with access to loans of prestigious paintings, Princeton’s University Art Museum plays host to “Mir Iskusstva: Russia’s Age of Elegance.”,Cast Sergei Diaghilev as impresario. Let him in 1899 found a prestigious literary and arts journal “Mir Iskusstva” (literally “World of Art”) so that literature, music, and the visual arts could coalesce to elicit pointed criticism and commentary. Make the journal epitomize the movement that set the trends in European art in the first decade of the twentieth century. Here stands the foundation for staging success in an artistic movement.,But Princeton takes a risk in displaying the art of such a little-known movement. ,Indeed, this show has been an excavation – almost more of archaeology than artistic finesse – to uncover, stratify, and demonstrate the influences of the “World of Art” movement, which itself faced pressure to gain popularity. ,It is simply because Russia remained in the nether-sphere of Asia and Europe – holding allegiance to neither – that the movement’s leaders had to think of ways to rectify misconceptions of Russian art. ,“I want to nurse Russian painting, cleanse it and bring it to the notice of the West,” Diaghilev famously said in 1897. He organized the first “World of Art” show the same year with English and German artists included and brought together the next year with Finnish and Russian artists. ,Even Tsar Nicholas II contributed 10,000 rubles a year to support the journal’s continuation. The magazine forwent publication in 1905 with the economy thirsty for sustenance during the Russo-Japanese war. But for the six years it ran, the journal broached conversation about the who’s hot and who’s not of Russian and European art. And discourse of the most pretentious kind inspires.,In Princeton’s exhibit showing most clearly the sophistication of Diaghilev’s milieu, Boris Kustodiev’s Group Portrait of the Members of the “World of Art” (1920) depicts men in the drawing room of Mstislav Dobuzhinsky opulently dressed in three-piece suits with hands placed round their chins in thought, or a glass stem in saturnine merriment. ,Catalyzed by symbolist authors such as Andrei Beliy, most famous for his tour de force Petersburg, those of the movement often lathered the pages of “World of Art” with pages of criticism and about the merging of life and art – for art to invoke civil change. But critics of the movement, such as Leo Tolstoy, threw backhanded insults against the lack of moralization in art. In a response within the pages of “World of Art,” Diaghilev said he saw the author’s criticism as a “slap in the face delivered to art by its ungrateful servant Leo Tolstoy, who rejects the art of all ages, lowering it to the level of a Christian virtue.” Instead of for morality, this movement came of art for art’s sake. Against the social realism of the late-19th century’s “The Wanderers” (“Peredvizhniki”), lofty-browed art connoisseurs with Alexander Benois and Leon Bakst sought a new expression in art – including Diaghilev. ,With the “World of Art” neglected at the Guggenheim’s “RUSSIA!” exhibit, one may consider the movement less worthy of investigation. Yet, the little known nature of its philosophy as “art for beauty” strikes a chord of poignancy for the movement.,Boris Kustodiev’s Portrait of Ivan Bilibin (1901) commands the show in undeniable beauty. The young, dignified man wears a ruffled, immaculately white shirt under his long-coat tuxedo. His eyes are piercing as he gazes just past you as if to emphasize his superiority. ,His counterpart would inevitably be the subject pictured in Konstantin Somov’s Portrait of Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva. Despite the fact that the girl is clothed and rendered in paint, she still managed to – shall we say – allow things to arise for even the most mature of teenage males. She’s intellectual and coquettish – an effect accomplished in the one tenuous brush stroke for each eyebrow. The shadow on the wall hints at her diabolical nature, her id emerging from the slight pout in her rose-petal lips that will make any straight male feel a bit funny inside. Her blouse of black hints at her inner darkness, and the maroon bow around the neck her playfulness.,Dilettantes who claim their disgust for portraiture will hold their tongues at this exhibition, because the figures are so compelling that they demand time from the audience to stand before the canvas and look even at the minutia. Sergei Sudeikin’s Portrait of Nina Schick, for example, presents a woman so angular and feline, with eyes so dark and cheekbones so high, I can almost place her home at Sevastopol on the Black Sea. ,The poster piece for the show, Léon Bakst’s Supper, shows the opulence of this “World of Art” culture with a woman leaning a champagne flute toward a bowl of oranges. Like many of the works in the show, the precarious balances remain unsettling as the oranges seem to be dropping – the one that has fallen to the table could roll more. The flowing table cloth has hints of the orange champagne combination – an inevitable utilization of what was available on the palette. The woman herself is amorous – at once busty and waistless – with a shapeless black hat and curving dress. We are led to her eyes and from her eyes to the empty chair next to her at a table set for one. This, perhaps, remains the perfect message for the “World of Art” – with a manifesto to consign more people as followers of Russian art. “Welcome,” the painting beacons, allowing us into its uneven, yet stunning, artistic house.,Bakst’s rendering of the movement’s impresario in Portrait of Sergei Diaghilev and his Nanny also sings in litany the message of the “World of Art” by showing the nanny of old Russia dark and decrepit in the corner, as Diaghilev of new culture stands robustly with gold cufflinks and pocket watch – toting a smug expression of aristocracy.,Not only did the “World of Art” rebel against the past of “The Wanderers’” social realism, but its leaders also shunned the avant-garde of the future. The “World of Art” refused to accept such artistic rebels as Kazimir Malevish, whose Black Square (presented exactly as it sounds) hit the word in 1915. The deconstruction and minimalism of such a painting would not embrace the ethos of the “World of Art” – to love art for arts’ sake. The avant-garde – fully of complex geometry and flashy colors – seems more popular to the typical student of art, but one must look away from the anti-art to embrace the true expression Diaghilev’s school.,Petersburg remains the showcase city of Benois’s illustrations to Alexander Pushkin’s famous poem The Bronze Horseman, and in the work, Pushkin notes that Peter the Great had broken a “window to Europe.” This seems poetic justice in the “World of Art” as part of a movement trying to inseminate its ideals into western culture. With such a mindset, Russia could flaunt its cultural heritage for an international community. ,Dobuzhinsky’s rendering of the city in 1914 presents starving trees, slanted houses, and Yevgeny Lanceray’s St. Petersburg. Old St. Nicholas’ Market (1901) shows the gloom of lumber exchange; however, despite the enervation, the wreckage, there exists beauty in decay—in the nature of Russia as it was and is.,The most haunting painting of the show remains Somov’s Sorcery, depicting a ravishing witch surrounded by innocent topiaries and flowers who renders flames to burn two naked lovers, caught in carnal embrace. In the same disturbing vein, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin in Thirsting Warrior and Boys, unnaturally-colored, androgynous figures with hardly indiscernible genitalia stalk the canvas to the tune of a shudder from onlookers.,To counter the horror we have the beauty. Valentin Serov’s Ida Rubenstein (1910) presents us with a bejeweled woman perhaps post-coital on midnight blue sheets, and her body appears rough, speckled with the texture of the paper. The chiaroscuro lavishing Zinaida Serebryakova’s Bath House stands as beautiful as the naked women in the scene – with their cone-shaped breasts, backsides, and toned stomachs accentuated by this masterful light play. One can lose himself in the bodies of this image coming to life in their cleansing at the bath.,There is the element of the Bakhtin carnivalesque in this school – with the festive scenes, theatrical stages, accordion-bustling snow days with temperatures so cold, shadows have a blue hue. In Boris Grigoriev’s Portrait of Vsyevolod Meyerhold (1916), a comical, breathless theater director (more circus master in this rendering) poses with flamboyant hands raised and his left arm – covered in a mask – reaches to his top hat. Behind, a menacing man in red Eastern garb – with a face the combination of contempt and constipation – raises a threatening bow to the sky. All decorum – social, artistic, religious – seems inverted in a way so twisted that the two figures, almost in a dance, intrigue more than scare in this swift flip of values.,And though resistance to the past and present remained with this theory, some artists were looking for trends in the future in formal practice.,Nathan Altman’s Portrait of Anna Akhmatova (1915) and Portrait of E.V. Dzubinskaya-Adamova (1915) in addition to Yuri Annenkov’s Portrait of the Photographer (1918) begin to show the elements of cubism with geometric shapes emphasizing color contrasts such as the canary yellow of Akhmatova’s scarf and her blue dress – given texture and movement to a new ideal.,Here Princeton has a gem little known to the world, consumed with classics and avant-garde. It is here for the taking. And the movement itself – only the interest in it – did not last, because of the constructing times under USSR.,A second “World of Art” culture began in 1924 with many of the founding members still organizing exhibitions in Moscow and Petersburg. But communist culture had grabbed society by the (Faberge) eggs, and the environment no longer stood conducive to art for art’s sake. ,And for God’s sake, help the preservation of such beauty; see this exhibit.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/back_in_the_cccp/,"

"“Got a man in Japan and a dude in Tahiti,,Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy.”,Lil’ Kim, “The Jump Off”,I do have a man in Japan and a dude in Tahiti. The Tahitian natives are rather naïve and think it clever to call themselves by the general descriptor, “dude.” I often refer to this particular Tahitian by “Dude” in jest, and although he seems amused, I am unable to say whether Mondo fully appreciates the facetious nature of the nickname.,There is a gentleman in Baltimore with whom I occasionally share a bottle of Hipnotiq, but he and I do not often receive the pleasure of each other’s company as the rap circuit does not frequent the Maryland area. The last time I was there, however, he took me to a surprisingly good Asian fusion restaurant where, unbeknownst to my good-hearted companion, I engaged in an exciting and raucous bathroom escapade with two waiters, one seating hostess, and three exceptionally skilled members of the janitorial staff. ,I have managed to form quite satisfactory relationships in all five of the New York City boroughs, concentrated, perhaps surprisingly, in Staten Island. I also have an extensive network of gentleman friends spread throughout the Tri-State Area, as I am there quite often and like to keep a diverse and well-rounded group of male callers at my disposal. ,In Los Angeles, there is a charming and exceptionally well-regarded man with whom I engage in oral sex whenever I am in the area. He is considered – justifiably, as far as I can tell – the best cunnilingus artist outside of Africa, where continental differences in language formation reveal startling capabilities in both agility and flexibility of the lips and tongue. ,My Japanese companion, whom I mentioned earlier, is a spry and well-formed student of acrobatics at the elite and highly competitive School of Circustry Arts. The school put on an impressive performance for myself and the G-Unit on our “Wanksta Wasians Tour” stop in Tokyo, after which I sent a note to Yoshi requesting his company in my luxurious hotel suite. His acrobatic prowess translates to skill and ingenuity in bed, and his intensive training has instilled in him an unimaginable work ethic and endurance which I have yet to encounter outside of the Orient. ,In Abu Dhabi, I have become quite close with the descendant of a Shah. Muhammad and I often retire to one of his family’s seventeen leisure estates, where a wait staff of thirty to forty-five assures our comfort, usually closed in his private quarters, for up to ten days. I also have become acquainted with an oil mogul in Texas whose fire for cash is unlike anything I’ve witnessed in the rap world of ice and rims. Despite his roundness around the middle, Jeb’s thick southern drawl and willingness to spend inordinate amounts of money on me, coupled with the ferocity with which he attacks any goal – including yours truly – keep our time together exhilarating and consistently satisfying. ,Contrary to my expectations, in the Netherlands I have established a number of successful connections with men who, despite their somewhat reserved nature, are, simply, exceptionally large. In Germany I have found that the rigidity of social relations can lead to a profound release in bed, creating an entire class of socially frustrated men whose primary source of energy displacement is the particularly rigorous physicality and violence of their fucking. Although one might expect similar socio-sexual phenomena in Japan, my experiences with Yoshi and others suggest to me that these tensions in Japan have manifested themselves quite differently, resulting in a proliferation not of an almost infeasible aggression, but rather a socially stunted and even childlike perversion and wonderment in regards to sexual intercourse.,After much consideration, I would conclude that my favorite intercourse destination must be settled in a tie. A number of factors (including, as previously mentioned, language differences) would point to South Africa as one of the clear winners. The specter of apartheid has left a significant number of resident white males with an attitude towards black women that can only be described as a mixture of distrust, repulsion, curiosity, and false altruism that leads to the most varied and exciting intercourse I have encountered in terms of emotion, aggression, foreplay, and speed. The other region of superior sexual skill is Siberia, which differentiates itself from the rest of the former USSR with its placement of prime importance on the creation of body heat. Simple geographical and climate-related factors have led the men of Siberia to develop a highly aerobic mode of intercourse which, as the sole source of heat production in their homes, they are able to maintain over unimaginable lengths of time and repeat after only very brief rests. Their style is so rigorous that even I, the indomitable Lil’ Kim, must sometimes request a water break. Or, preferably, Cristal.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/a_day_in_the_life_of_lil_kim/,"

"I don’t have to scan two teeth, I can scan one.” The girl running to the register with the second set of gummy gums and uppers slows down, and Jeff Struble continues to ring her up. “You wouldn’t happen to be in college, would you?” he asks. ,“No!” cry four high school girls and a mother in unison. “Right,” laughs one of them. “We’re acting like we’re in preschool!” ,But reversion to infancy is normal in Ricky’s Candy, Cones & Chaos. “I had a kid in Morristown just standing with a rat in his mouth,” Jeff calls out to a couple perusing the gummy rodents. “Just standing there, the whole head in his mouth, gnawing on it. It’s this big!” He waits for me to look up. “This big!” he cries, holding his hands a foot and a half apart. “You get to see stupid things because people get stupid in here. You pick up just about everything.” ,Jeff is Director of Customer Relations for Ricky’s. With mid-length light red hair, an eager smile, and a green Chinese character tatooed at the base of each forearm, the Ricky’s logo on Jeff’s black polo shirt is the only indication that he works in a candy store. But he loves his job, he tells me, and he’s been here from its very conception. “Hit it hard, hit it hard!” he cries to a girl struggling with some stopped-up bulk candy. “Open palm, not a fist! I worked with the founder at FAO Schwartz.” ,Despite Jeff’s insistence that Ricky’s was designed in contrast to the old-time feel of the FAO Schweetz model, Ricky’s still operates under the same philosophy – that a store can be more than a store; that it can be an experience. “We’re trying to do two things here,” he tells me. “One, bring you back to the old candy store. Second, be more bright and fun like Disney, more Disney than FAO – because Disney is that thing that you can try and never kill it. Get down here, what do you see?” he asks, squatting to the floor. “It’s so much for kids. We are trying to be a kids candy store. Look at all this from down here.”,An instant later he is walking quickly around the store, rearranging out-of-place boxes and adjusting displays. “Kids come in here and feel like they’re in an amusement park – that’s why we have Ricky, the dragon, the mascot.” He reaches out and smacks a green plastic foot twice, eliciting a loud, hollow reverberation. ,Jeff is referring to the candy and ice-cream-toting green dragon who graces most Ricky’s insignia and signage. On the napkins and napkin-holders, Ricky is there. On walls, on totes, on t-shirts and boxes, Ricky is there. He is on Jeff’s polo shirt, smiling at me, and, in stuffed miniature, he surrounds his plastic patriarch. And, apparently, he sells. Jeff reaches for one of a few dozen stuffed Rickies. “The plush does extremely – they call it plush, stuffed animals – hello, how are ya?” he calls to an adult couple who have just entered the store. “Have you been here before? Well,” he adds, gesturing around, “there’s fun stuff for kids right there, Easter – here – the good chocolate is there in the back, that’s the more classic candy, and then the ice cream.” ,Until he pointed it out to this overwhelmed couple, I hadn’t even noticed the pattern of the store’s layout. Explosive and addictive, candy pops out from all sides, from consoles on the floor, from displays that reach to the ceiling. ,The first glimpse is overwhelming. The color palette is bubbly and jarring at the same time, a candy concoction of bright purple floors, neon green walls, and shelving of purple, green, and orange plastic. An inlay of light blue into the purple linoleum guides the awestruck customer past, on the left, an entire wall of bulk candy and, on the right, the Easter display, the kids’ candy, towards the register, past the classic candy, and into the realms of Cones and Chaos, which together fill the back of the store. ,The selection alone is enough to induce a heart attack. At the edge of the kids’ candy section, a compartmentalized stand holds twenty-four flavors of swirled candy sticks. Past it, a tall tiered stand that sprouts plastic lollipops offers three sizes and dozens of flavors of disk-shaped Whirly pops; tall, thin Unicorn swirl pops; and Blow Pops, Tootsie Pops, and Dum-Dums from depressions in its base. The shelving against the right wall challenges my capacity for comprehending variety. Cherry Ice Blow Pops and Fluffy Stuff Cotton Candy Pops flank the botton shelf. Above them are Dum-Dum Gumpops in reasonable and Jumbo sizes; Jolly Rancher Lollipops; Creamy Chupa Chups; and a Lollipop Paint Shop kit that boasts a candy brush and sour candy powder. The Soda Pop package screams, “Lick it! Dip it! Chug it!” ,Around an orange shelving separator and on to the next section, the deluge gives way to a plethora of Pez dispensers. There are fifteen choices for the classic candy dispenser, classicly sized. Grinning cartoon fruits, the zebra from the Disney film Madagascar, Bob the Builder, Looney Tunes’ Buzz Bunny and Sylvester, and the Incredible Hulk all lift their jaws and pop a Pez. On a lower shelf, large boxes hold more overtly corporate Pez’s: for the Disney film Chicken Little; the Bratz doll line; the Disney Princeses; Nascar. And, on the top shelf, foot-high Leviathan Pez’s dispense entire packs of the candy.,Past this frenetic section is the register, where Jeff rings up an older woman and, behind him, a flat screen TV plays clips from the Munsters and Green Acres, while Ricky smiles from the lower-right hand corner of the screen. Jeff hands the woman her change and she thanks him profusely.,“My mother told me to be a good person and that’s what I do every day,” he says.,“You are!” cries the woman, walking towards the door. ,“Thanks! Have a sweet day and come back and see us soon!”,“I will!” she cries gleefully, her voice childlike and small. , “Jelly Belly is a great company,” Jeff says. He reaches for a box of Easter Tradition Jelly Bellys, on a shelving unit laden with Jelly Belly merchandise. “They have great packaging, they think about what they do. See, these are for Easter. But after Easter – ” he slides off the holiday casing to reveal a standard box underneath. “That’s very good marketing.”,The Jelly Belly shelf section comes in the first break of the bulk candy dispensers that line the front half of the store’s entire left wall. First come the Jelly Bellys themselves, in twenty-four glorious flavors. After the first set of shelves come twenty-four types of gummies – brains, teeth, blue killer sharks, cherries, zebras, the long-loved worms, and the classic bears. The next shelving break brings the classic chocolates – the Lindt, the Ghirardhelli, Toblerone and Ferrerro Rocher – and then it’s back to the bulk: six kinds of licorices, swirled, boxed, and twisted; chocolate pieces, caramels, jawbreakers, original rock candy, and sixteen varieties of chocolate- and yogurt-covered confections. And, finally, the twenty-three types of sour candies—Sour Patch Kids, Strips, Strings, O’s, and Bottles—Cola and Cherry. ,“Where are the bags?” asks a woman from the Jelly Belly bulk section. Jeff jogs over to point them out to her, and then walks back over to me. “You know, that’s the most-asked question here,” he says. “I need a flashing sign. I want to hang it right here, on these gondola pieces, that flashes Bags, Bags, Bags, with the arrow.” He traces a hypothetical neon line down a large purple piece of vertical shelf separator. “I have all these ideas but we can’t do them yet, you know.” His eyes look to the floor in frustration, but he perks up again when I venture how much I love Swedish Fish. “Well, I think it’s because they’re hard on the outside but chewy in the middle. Have you had those black and white peach penguins? Not the peach colored – those are hard! They’re hard! I’m talking about the black and white ones – the other ones are hard! but these are great.”,The first Ricky’s opened in May 2004 in Summit, New Jersey, even though this store, the Princeton branch, was planned to open first. ,“That’s the price of having to wait for permits,” Jeff tells me. “Cities and towns have different processes for this type of thing, and some are more difficult than others and some are not.” He looks me over for an instant, wondering whether to let me in on the truth. “From what I hear, Princeton University owns a lot of the town…and, well, those permits, especially for something this green and purple, in a town like this one – so we’re just gonna plug away, keep plugging away.”,He walks towards the Easter table and begins straightening up the rows and columns of chocolate lambs and bunnies, organizing the carrot-shaped bags of orange Jelly Bellys and Reese’s Pieces. “This town makes you earn it,” he says, reaching down to grab a stuffed candy basket that has fallen. “In Morristown, when we opened the door it was crazy. In Summit we had to call the police because people were beating on the windows so hard we had to open the door.” He looks at me, the glee gone from his expression. “It was creepy.”,The light returns to his eyes as he continues. “You just hope that’s a snowball that keeps rolling” – he lifts his arms above his head, opening them wider in quick intervals, “because we do better in this store when another store is opening, when more people recognize who this guy is.” He points to a picture of Ricky on a child’s purple t-shirt. ,The front of the store is all Candy; the back is the land of Cones and Chaos. Past it, a row of round Ricky’s tables is surrounded by waffle-cone shaped chairs. To their left is the Chaos Party Room; behind them, the Chaos Factory, where behind a large window the ice cream is made in-house; next to that, a long hallway to restrooms and offices. ,Nearby is bulletin board marked “Belly Buster Challenge Hall of Fame,” dozens of photos show mostly teenaged boys looking ill. ,Moving back along the row of small round tables, each one plastered with Ricky’s smiling picture, Jeff indicates the room to our left. “The idea is, you bring the kids, we’ll bring the party.”,Past the Party Room and at the back of the row of tables and waffle cone chairs is the Chaos Factory. Ricky, holding a wrench, smiles broadly over the large window that looks into an ice cream factory, where a young employee is mixing something and watching me curiously. I wave hello.,Towards the front of the store, the same couple is still poking around the licorice. “See, those gloves help a lot, don’t they?” asks Jeff, glowing. Watching him watch them as they dig through licorice strings, my curiosity takes over and I finally ask Jeff the question that’s been brewing up inside me: Doesn’t he ever get sick of looking at candy? ,“Naaaw, I love candy,” he says without pause. “I absolutely love candy. I am the biggest P-I-G when it comes to it. I don’t know anybody worse than me.” I wait for a break in his speech, but one does not come. “Seriously,” he goes on, “you put it in front of me and I’ll eat it. And especially when we have a new store, we’re making ice cream – ” The phone rings and Jeff is off to the register. “Sport bean recall! Sport bean recall!” he cries, running to the Jelly Belly Shelf and then disappearing with two poles hung with red Sport Bean bags. ,With his insatiable sweet tooth, I tell Jeff when he returns, it’s no wonder he works in a candy store. “You know,” he says, “my favorite part of my job is that it’s different every day. I get to see the differences in how people sell things, how the stores are shaped, how the stores sell. I just make sure the customer and the franchise is happy. I look and see, can you shop this store? There’s got to be a picture, a picture or a story to something. Everything has a reason to exist. You always have to think of yourself as a consumer.

"A couple Fridays ago, joined by the presidents of Kappa and Pi Phi, I spoke as the Theta representative at Take Back the Night. The evening was frantically managed, with speakers from what seemed like every organization on campus standing up to say that—surprise!—they were all against sexual assault. We were there to show the sororities’ solidarity with the message of the event and, going into it, the three of us were under the impression we’d be reading some campus statistics. When we arrived, however, we were told we’d been expected to prepare a speech.,Needless to say, our presentation did not go as smoothly as desired. As the representative of more than a hundred smart and independent women on this campus, I was deeply ashamed as I walked off the stage, sure that I’d helped drive home some of the worst misconceptions about Princeton sorority girls. I ended the evening thankful only for the weather: because of the cold, most people had left as soon as the headline speaker had finished, and few were around to witness our talk. ,But after such an utterly forgettable failure, I couldn’t shake my profound sense of guilt. Shoulda-woulda-coulda’s kept me from sleeping, and I realized it was because I’d actually had something to say, and I had wasted my opportunity. So here it is, in apology and defense: ,Princeton is a school with a dynamic and ambitious student body, and endless subgroups and subcultures, each of whom espouses its own values and emulates its own heroes. Under all of that eclecticism, however, lurks a strong and undeniable homogenizing force: the pull that takes skater boys who didn’t drink and has them getting wasted in polo shirts by the end of freshman year; the gentle tug that convinces would-be English majors to opt for Economics instead; and the boys club mentality that teaches women to be proud of their bodies instead of their minds. ,I’m not sure when I accepted the fact that most parties here are themed to get girls in as little clothing as possible, or how I sidestepped furor at the power plays that result from the peculiar politics of the Street. The notion of “third floor bicker” was distant and darkly funny, and the prevalence of regretted hookups in lieu of dates and relationships seemed like an obnoxious but tolerable quirk. I allowed myself to think of a salad as a meal and to stop drinking regular soda, and I accepted resignation in a world where thin is beautiful and curves are lucky if they elicit an offensive remark. ,But on Friday night, faced with the prospect of saying something about male-female relations on campus, I suddenly felt ready to burst. A miniskirt is not consent, I had wanted to say. Women are not objects, and they are not playthings. Our minds cannot be divorced from our bodies at your convenience; organic sexuality is deep and beautiful, and is not the product of Beast and lingerie. There is a world where people dance not as an excuse to play drunken tonsil-hockey, but because they enjoy moving their bodies to music. And there is something in all of us, whether we acknowledge it or not, that wonders what we are doing to ourselves. ,Growing up, I never considered myself a feminist; I thought of feminism as burning your bra and refusing to shave your armpits, as thinking of all men as pigs and of the penis as the source of evil and oppression in the world. I had trouble empathizing with girls who were too weak to stand up for themselves or who were too intimidated to speak up in class. Blinded by my own strengths, I thought of the world—or at least the United States—as meritocratic regardless of gender. Male or female, I believed, the strong and the worthy prospered. ,But as I have learned, this is not always the case. Women’s power over men lies in the long-acknowledged subtleties of femininity, in the understanding, so perfectly described in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, that “the neck can turn the head.” But men’s power, too, is subtle. It lies not in the force used to crush women’s wills but in the disrespect used to corrupt them, because once we offer our bodies as bait instead of protecting them as the prize, we’re lost. ,Most people who become feminists in college probably do so in the context of mass protests against female genital mutilation in Africa or rallies for the rights of pre-teen sex slaves in Asia. But I had wanted to go to a university that was apolitical, I’d thought; I was bothered by the spoiled left-wingers who compromised our election by voting for Nader and held environmentalist rallies every time the groundskeeper cut the grass. So I came to Princeton, where I could soak up a truly spectacular education in peace, avoiding both shrieking tree-huggers and, as I’ve come to see, any challenges to the campus status quo.,I know, I know, it’s college—our last chance to party with abandon, to enjoy free love and bad beer and a life free from responsibility. And believe me, I enjoy that life. But somewhere along the way a line has been crossed. I learned a few Fridays ago—as I had already guessed—that Princeton’s statistics for sexual assault are far lower than those at other schools, and yet I suspect that chauvinism and misogyny have devalued as many students here as anywhere. I don’t know how we’ve sunk into such apathy, nor do I know how to remedy it. But we must force ourselves to remember that seeing a woman’s body is a privilege, not a right, and that sex is not an empty commodity to be exploited for its entertainment value. Princeton students are supposed to be the leaders of tomorrow, but in an atmosphere that divides CEO’s from Office Ho’s, it’s clear who’s expected to come out on top.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/feminism__assault/,"

"Some years back, while browsing , fan sites (I obviously had lots of friends in high school), I happened upon one that listed the AIM screennames of several actors who played big roles on the show. I dutifully added the names to my buddy list – here were my true friends! – and waited patiently for the chance to badger them. That chance finally came one afternoon when older Pete’s friend Bill signed on, after months of inactivity. “What if you could be rich forever, but you had to go to the bathroom out your nose? Would you do it?” I asked (conundrums of this sort were Bill’s trademark on the show). ,The response was slightly more caustic than I had hoped for: “Listen, punk, if you ever talk to me again I’ll come to your house with a box full of burning hot French fries and jam them into your eyeballs one by one!” Though scarring on a personal level, this exchange has done nothing to diminish my fondness for the series itself.,It’s really a wonder that ,ever got on TV in the first place. Probably best described as a cross between Twin Peaks and , the show chronicled the exploits of the Wrigley brothers (both with red hair, both named Pete) and the bizarre cast of characters they encountered in their hometown of Wellsville. Wellsville was a town suffused with surrealism, where incidents like the accidental lamination of pets or the freeze-drying of Cuba as a practical joke were commonplace. Punk rock legend Iggy Pop played a regular character as the father of younger Pete’s friend Nona. A motley collection of other celebrities made cameos during the show’s three-season run as well – LL Cool J  (a math teacher), Steve Buscemi (a guidance counselor), and NFL Hall of Famer Art Donovan (himself), to name a few. It also had a fantastic but unconventional soundtrack, populated by indie groups like The Magnetic Fields and The Apples in Stereo.,Beginning in 1989 as a series of shorts, the show was filmed in the northern New Jersey towns of Cranford and South Orange and aired on Nickelodeon as a full-length endeavor for three seasons, from 1993 to 1996. Vigilant viewers could catch reruns until 1999, at which point it was pulled indefinitely. Creators Will McRobb and Chris Vicardi have made a few forays into movies and television since then, most prominently with the unfortunate 2000 film “Snow Day,” but they have failed to launch a commercially successful project since the Wrigley brothers went off the air. ,All the show’s quirks help to explain how ,has developed a semblance of a cult following in the years since it went off the air – they make for great rewatchability – but it remains to be explained what kids liked so much about this show in the first place. I’m certain I didn’t know quite what I was laughing at in elementary school when, for instance, a bus driver feeling betrayed in the aftermath of Career Day, screams at older Pete, “Carrot top Judas! Thou hast forsaken me!”, or when younger Pete finds Jimmy Hoffa’s wallet while digging a tunnel out of his house. ,Ultimately, though, all the historical references and surrealist humor existed within what was a pretty conventional framework. Narratives were driven by all the familiar tropes of adolescent TV: the school bully, the unreasonable teacher, the awkward courtship with the girl next door, etc. It moralized in a very unchallenging way, gradually acquiring a more serious tinge in the second and third seasons as older Pete negotiated the familiar path through high school. Every show ended with gentle guitar and thoughtful narration from older Pete, as he hashed out in very clear terms whatever life lesson it was that the audience was supposed to take from the episode. ,When you consider ,in these terms, it’s tempting to write it off as potentially original show held back by a tired genre. It’s certainly true that there are constraints imposed by setting and format on the show, and on every show in its genre; after all, your typical childhood in the suburbs doesn’t allow for a great deal of thematic variety, particularly when it’s portrayed only in half-hour intervals. ,But all this isn’t to say that ,was trite or unoriginal. In my way of thinking, what gives the show its enduring value was its understanding of its limits. The talent of the writers lay in taking simple narrative ideas – there’s little you can do in a format like this that hasn’t already been done – and working from there to make the finished product as distinctive as possible. Very often, episodes of ,boiled down simply to battles between good and evil. Evil on the show took a variety of unusual forms. Bullies with supervillian-like characteristics – and names like Paper Cut, Pit Stain, and Endless Mike – harassed the Wrigley brothers on a daily basis. Adults of all stripes – occasionally under the auspices of the “International Adult Conspiracy” – constantly endeavored to crush the spirit of youth in one way or another.,In other cases, the Petes dealt with problems like boring family vacations or impossible tests. With the help of Artie, their own personal super hero, Pete and Pete engaged in compelling struggles which, without the inventiveness of the show’s writers, would have been decidedly tedious. ,Certainly, the surreal elements of the show have always held it back from universal acclaim – after all, your average ,fan wasn’t going to laugh at jokes about bowling balls with supernatural powers or a bear almost getting elected to the House of Representatives. But it was the happy marriage between the surreal and the quotidian that made ,a classic. The humor of the show was so effective because of its juxtaposition with otherwise familiar situations. The narrative, meanwhile, was checked from becoming cloying and sappy by the subversive elements of the show. As a result, kids could enjoy and relate to the show’s characters without feeling self-conscious or suspicious. The characters themselves were exceptionally well-drawn – the sentimental, impressionable older Pete and the courageous, recalcitrant younger Pete – and despite the subversive elements, the show was fundamentally good-hearted.,It’s little wonder, then, that this show has proved so endearing for its select following of fans. Seasons one and two have been released on DVD, while the petition to get season three released is twenty-five hundred strong. I can make a variety of considered arguments these days as to why ,is one of the great children’s TV shows of all time. When I watched it as a kid, of course, this wasn’t the case, but I loved it probably for little else than that I wished my life was more like the one presented in the show, that I could do things like ride my bike across four states, dig a tunnel out of my house, or accidentally topple the Asian bond market. When you’re talking about a children’s TV show, though, there are few criteria more revealing than that.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/bite_my_scab_blowhole/,"

"A man, Dave ,A dog, Charlie ,A woman, Alice  ,—no dialogue is audible—  ,The action opens on a bright sunny spring day on a residential street of a bustling city. Music: chipper. People are walking around or driving cars; everyone looks pretty happy to be alive. A couple, with arms linked around the waist, walks past the front door of a house. The door opens and a handsome, mid-30s man walks out with a golden retriever on a leash. This man is Dave. He is manly but friendly and approachable-looking; he wears jeans and sneakers, a sweater, and some sort of sporty zip-up. His dog, Charlie, is adorable. Walking out the door, Dave hangs a right and walks down the street with the dog. When they stop at corners he musses Charlie’s fur. At one corner a young girl tries to pet the dog. She pulls back her hand, giggling, when the dog’s mouth turns to her, but after encouragement from Dave and her mother, she eventually is able to pat gently the dog’s side. She giggles more.  Crossing the street, Dave and Charlie enter upon a large park. It is comfortably full of people: young men playing frisbee, women reading on benches, children and parents playing in a playground, a few other people playing with their dogs. The man and his dog walk up to a kiosk on the periphery of the park. Next to it is a stand which advertises hot dogs, ice cream, and lemonade. It is unclear what this stand sells; it looks like a large newspaper stand, but there don’t seem to be newspapers. Dave goes up to the window and exchanges words with the man working inside. We don’t hear what they say, but they appear to know one another. The worker leans out of the window and Charlie jumps his forelegs up so that he can be petted. The gesture seems very familiar. Dave hands the worker some bills and he is handed in return a large bunch of hanging brown chewtoys. Charlie starts barking, bouncing around and wagging his tail, and Dave pets his head roughly but affectionately. Hoisting the large bundle in the air by its bound tails, Dave and Charlie head toward the park. It is at this point that it becomes clear that Dave is holding a large bunch of squirrels. They are alive, unhappy but not overly rambunctious, wiggling around and hanging upside down, bound by their tails.  The park they are in is quite large, and Dave and Charlie walk-jog over to an uninhabited area on the far side, smiling at people as they go. Charlie is extremely excited and Dave seems happy, too. Once they have some space, Dave spouts some happy dog-talk to Charlie and Charlie takes off running down the park. Dave pulls a squirrel from the bunch, whips it around by the tail with quick flicks of the wrist and sends it flying into the air towards his bounding dog. Charlie leaps up with glee, catching the squirrel in his teeth. Dave cheers and smiles, patting his thighs as Charlie runs back with his catch in mouth. He drops the squirrel at Dave’s feet, and is given a treat from Dave’s pocket and a pat on the head as reward. Dave picks up from his feet the dead or dying squirrel, gives it another few whips around and sends it sailing into the air for Charlie to retrieve. This time the squirrel takes more of a flyball trajectory, and Charlie runs around in little circles under it waiting to see where it will land. Behind him, we see a pretty young woman sitting on a bench, reading alone. This is Alice. She looks at Charlie with bright eyes, watching him run around. Eventually the squirrel hits the ground and Charlie skids over to it. We see the woman laughing, and we see Dave notice her laughing.  Charlie runs back to Dave and drops the squirrel at his feet. He appears to be dead, so Dave picks it up and tosses it aside into some bushes. With a glint in his eye, he squats down and scratches Charlie behind the ears with both hands, petting him in an encouraging manner. Alice notices Dave checking her out, and she tries at least to appear focused on her book. Dave turns to the bundle of squirrels, which is lying beside him, writhing gently but too discombobulated and multi-directional to head off anywhere. Looking at the squirrels, he picks one which is moving a lot more than the others. Reaching for it, it starts squirming wildly. Dave takes it by the tail, spinning it around more gently than the previous squirrel and lobbing it into the air with a wide arc of his arm. The squirrel is sent flying and Charlie rushes off to catch it. It is heading right toward Alice, who looks up from her book with raised eyebrows and then tries to look away coyly. Charlie is at her feet, tail sweeping her legs, waiting for the squirrel to land. But Charlie misses it initially, and the squirrel takes off under Alice’s legs, which she raises instinctively, scared but laughing. Dave jogs over from where he was standing, about fifty yards away, and we see him looking under the bench for the squirrel, petting Charlie and apologizing to the woman, touching her shoulder and ultimately shaking her hand. He introduces himself, and she smiles, and he introduces Charlie, whom she pets nervously. Dave nods toward the park, and the woman smiles, reluctantly, but walks over with Dave, Charlie bounding out ahead of them. When they reach the squirrels, Charlie is trying in vain to poke at them with his nose, but they keep wiggling around.  Dave picks up the bunch of squirrels from the ground and offers it to Alice. She recoils, waving her hands in front of her but giggling nonetheless. Dave puts his hand on her shoulder, enticing her to reconsider, and then plucks a smaller squirrel from the bunch. He gives it a few practice whip-arounds and a fake toss, demonstrating before handing it to Alice. She looks skeptical, but up for the challenge. She takes the squirrel, whips it around a few times and lobs it into the air. Charlie takes off after it, a bit leisurely because it doesn’t go too far. But Dave claps and pats her on the back, congratulating her. He offers her another squirrel and she accepts, heartened. She whips it around, practicing while she waits for Charlie to run back. He does, drops the squirrel he has, and she whips the new one into the air and sends it flying. Dave looks legitimately impressed. He gives her an impressed eyebrow-raise-head-nod. Charlie runs back and drops a really mangled, bloody squirrel at their feet. Alice begins to reach for it before realizing how disgusting it looks. She pulls her hand back and backs into Dave, who puts his hands on her upper arms. She turns around, laughing, and then stops abruptly as they share a moment of chemistry-laced eye contact. She looks down, flushing red, and Dave looks at her, smiling and surprised. Charlie runs around them happily. Alice motions away with her head, looking past the park towards a dusky street and looking at her watch. She gestures away. Dave tentatively reaches for his pocket, looking at her questioningly and ultimately pulling a cell phone from his pocket. She nods emphatically and takes the phone from him, presumably entering her phone number. He smiles and looks down at a tail-wagging Charlie, patting him on the head. Alice looks up, Dave looks up. She hands him his phone and starts to turn away, then turns back. They exchange an awkward almost-hug-but-wait-let’s-shake-hands-instead. Smiling, Alice walks away towards the late-afternoon-lit street, turning once to look over her shoulder and smile. Dave is beaming. He squats down and enthusiastically scratches and pets Charlie. There is one more squirrel lying on the ground. Dave picks it up and tosses it into the air for Charlie, who runs after it. The shot freezes on the image of Charlie leaping into the air, back arched, head turned back over his shoulder with squirrel in mouth.

"My flamenco dress has hung in my closet flaunting the same stains for almost two years, but I refuse to clean it. Each splotch and crease reminds me of a different moment from my brief dancing stint during my semester abroad in Sevilla. I hesitate to say “study abroad” because studying is not the point of going to Spain– not when the sun sets at 10 p.m. and the streets reawaken with sangria and smoke at 2 a.m. As an American living there, I quickly learned that Spain defies all study.  ,I went to Spain because I wanted to become Spanish. The Spanish language, I believed, would guide me into a whole world of tradition and history, of thinking and behaving, of breathing and seeing. To some extent, this was foolish idealism. My plan of making Spanish friends fell through almost immediately when I realized that there was no “campus” at the Universidad de Sevilla, and that Spanish students tend to stick with their established groups of friends outside class. Most of my American classmates preferred speaking English most of the time, and my friends from other countries faded in and out of my life. Even the city itself was in constant flux. I watched wooden seats in the main plaza be constructed and demolished for Semana Santa, during which groups of Nazarenes cloaked in white carry Christian icons around the city. For one week in April, thousands of women in flamenco dresses migrated in bright-colored flocks to the Feria festival in Los Remedios, which returned to its dull 1950s-apartment character as soon as the sun set on the last Sunday festival. As an American, I was an outsider and observer. I wanted to do something to fit in with Spaniards. When my American roommate Sofia suggested dance lessons, I jumped at the chance. ,Sevillanas, the local flamenco-style dance of Sevilla, involves dancing with a partner for four distinct parts of an upbeat guitar-based song. Each part involves delicately rotating your wrists, taking small but precise steps, and twirling and stomping in a proud “¡Olé!” I learned to dance sevillanas from a fiesty blonde Spaniard named Nuria. Her pudgy body took up most of the space in her living room as she impatiently showed Sofia and me the four movements of sevillanas. My lack of coordination did not bring out my teacher’s sunny side. When I couldn’t remember one of the parts of the routine and mistakenly stepped forward with my right foot several times, she slapped my left thigh and ordered “¡la izquierda!” She also accused me of not standing close enough to my partner (her smelly self). Besides sevillanas, Nuria taught us that you could save 40 euros on the high-speed train by buying a ticket to Córdoba and just staying on until Madrid (we never did try it), and that Madrid men are “stiff, cold” dancers (we never did find out). I’d had just about enough of Nuria until she took Sofia and me to a dress shop around the corner from her house. That was when I saw the dress: black with large white polka-dots. I’ll never forget going into the cluttered dressing room and zipping up the long skirt, then slipping on the matching blouse and jacket. I had the spent three months in Spain until that point feeling too white, American, useless. Suddenly, I had a style and a purpose. ,To date, I have spent seven months of my life in Spain, but I have felt the most “Spanish” dancing sevillanas in that dress. For the festival of Feria, my American friends and I proudly walked the San Telmo Bridge in our trajes de flamenco and tap shoes, with flowers in our hair, just like thousands of Spanish women around us. When we got to the festival, we saw hundreds of striped tents with a different party in each. The public tents, sponsored by municipalities and political parties (the socialists seemed to have the best music), offered dancing and drinking for one week straight. When people got tired of dancing, they could play carnival games or ride the Ferris wheel. At Feria, no one sleeps. During the day horses carry men and women with their feet and skirts hanging off the sides. At all hours of the night someone is singing about the dance queen of the Triana or Macarena districts, and someone is dancing the four sevillanas movements. I understood that this dance was my ticket into the Spanish world, as long as I kept my feet going, and as long as I kept returning to Feria in my dress.,For sure, I was one of the clumsiest dancers there. I tripped on my skirt several times, as the dust on the skirt’s bottom ruffles reveal. Nuria had failed to teach me the hand movements for two entire dance segments, so I had no idea what to do after the 360-degree turn on the third movement, or during the entire fourth part. But I had the basic vocabulary in my heels, my mind, and my lips. I could go up to anyone–old or young, male or female– and ask to dance. That way, I met Spaniards from all over Spain, and improved a different step of the dance with each new encounter. I watched them rotate their waists, stomp their feet, and circle their wrists with startling precision all week. Confident and passionate, they had duende, that nearly-indefinable force and spirit that propels much of Spanish art and motion. I was jealous that even a 7-year-old girl out-danced me, and laughed when I got confused on the third movement. Her movements were as spotless as her blue dress. My dress had already collected splotches from the puddles at the foot of the bridge where Sofia and I were carried on the backs of a German and a Cypriote, and near the bar where I first learned how to speak the lyrical Spanish of an Argentine, around the time Sofia and I started having long conversations about injustices and politics. When I look at my dress, I realize that I wouldn’t trade my smattering of international encounters for anything. Insofar as I learned so much about many nations and ways of thinking, I had indeed “studied” in Spain. ,Flamenco dresses have bata de cola skirts– layers of taffeta extending to the floor that puff out at the bottom as the dancer twirls in circles. Twirling faster and faster, just like the cycles of my life in Sevilla. Comings and goings pushed the months forward. I met an American who said he was leaving for good in April because he hated teaching Spanish, and then returned two weeks later to pass a language proficiency test for teaching abroad. I saw my roommate Sofia grow disappointed with her Spanish flings, then decide to spend an additional year in Sevilla. The French girl who lived upstairs and barely spoke in January became my roommate for a week in May. The bar where my flat-mates and I went our first night in the city and ordered scathing plum sherry was also the last place I saw flamenco before I left. ,As I sit here with a dirty flamenco dress I haven’t worn since April 2004, I subscribe to the city’s motto “NoDo.” The acronym stands for “Sevilla no me ha dejado,” meaning “Sevilla has not left me.” I don’t know when I will physically go back to Sevilla, but the splotches on my skirt tell me the memories will never wash away.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/discovering_my_duende/,"

"Come for the shouting and shattered glass, stay for the confessional outbursts, wry dialogue, and fascinating sexual politics. This superb production, directed by Whitney Mosery ’08, presents the tragic aftermath of a man’s inexplicable affair with a goat – the traditional mascot of lechery. In this play, which is something like a tragicomedy of coming-out, quinquagenarian architect Martin (Joshua Williams ’07) attempts to reconcile his wife, son, and best friend to an embarrassing – some would say ‘abominable’ – infatuation. Along the way, we learn a little about love, sex, family, the humanity of tolerance, and nostalgie de la boue.,The set looks exactly like you would expect an architect’s house to look, but with more flowers – presumably chosen to foreground the theme of nature. When the play begins, Martin has just won the Pritzker and is slated to be interviewed by old buddy Ross. It’s probably not beyond reason to see a connection between Martin and Albee himself given the analogy of architect and playwright, Albee’s homosexuality, his advanced age, and his garnering of three Pulitzers. Apparently suffering from a touch of hysterical amnesia, Martin nonetheless plays a few rounds of the witty repartee game with wife Stevie (Ashley Johnson ’08). But why does he seem so nervous and ashamed? And oh what is that rural redolence?,Martin is played by Joshua Williams ’07 with a sculpted coif and customary virtuosity. He puts across an empathetic portrayal of a figure whose pastoral predilection is decidedly alienating. Williams plays his role quietly and well – he seems sensitive, bruised, repressed, and yet on occasion he rises to argue with vigor and passion for the love that dare not bleat its name.,Shawn Fennel ’09 plays boyish homosexual “Billy,” and he has the slinking posture, careful dress, and neat haircut to prove it. Billy – “as gay of the 90’s” according to the delightfully idiotic mot of Martin – was the erstwhile black sheep of the family until he was spectacularly overleapt in that category by Martin. Probably the strongest scenes of the play are the loud, naked, and honest exchanges between Billy and Martin during which they reach rapprochement.,Max Staller ’08 brings confidence and avuncular verisimilitude to the role of Ross, television personage and jolly establishment thug. Ross peppers his speech with mentions of the “good ‘ol’” this and that. Ostensibly the “best friend” of Martin, Ross is in no way sympathetic to what he coaxes Martin into revealing, and soon enough he unleashes his inner Rick Santorum by penning a devastating yet flowery tell-all letter to Stevie.,So often in life, whenever someone has occasion to yell, we have occasion to cringe at whatever ugly squeak or inglorious croak they happen to emit. The rare display of vocal passion typically besmirches the very emotion it announces. The effect is exacerbated onstage: many a production has been sullied by a shout which is either patently insincere or patently histrionic. Thank God nothing like that happens here: the shouting in this play is first-rate – throaty, sharp, uvula-aflutter (ok, maybe not the uvula part) – particularly on the part of Ashley Johnson ’08 who demonstrates that Hell hath indeed no fury like a woman scorned for a barnyard animal. Johnson plays Martin’s wife Stevie, and man is she pissed. Johnson succeeds both in her flashes of anger and in the cool malice she radiates. At one point, she breaks vessel after vessel (conveniently in abundance and within reach) in what quickly becomes meta-theatrical gag.,Albee’s dialogue is as always enriched by his ironic attunement to the foibles, quirks, and curious shortfalls of our language. Frequently, his characters depart from the matter at hand in order to make side-points about language and its occasionally hilarious inadequacy. For instance, when reading Ross’s letter of the oh-so-shocking content, Stevie can’t help but digress every now and then to make fun of his stilted phrasing.,In Greek the word for tragedy derives from the word for goat. Albee subtitled his play, “Notes toward a definition of tragedy,” and it seems that Albee’s idea of tragedy here is not so much the crush of an unbearable crisis or the tug of an irresolvable conflict as the absurd intrusion of something utterly anomalous. The other characters find Martin’s love for a goat inconceivable and so therefore monstrous and so therefore wrong. Stevie describes Martin’s love for the goat as “outside the rules, doesn’t even relate to the rules.” She morbidly recites a list of catastrophes which she would have been better equipped to handle, awful (or funny) as they may be. Albee has a point here. Somehow if John G. Donne – instead of just plain dying – had announced one day to Joan Didion that he was into goats now, I just don’t see her writing a wonderful book about the experience.  That said, The Year of Magical Thinking is a great book, and this is a great play.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/whos_afraid_of_bestiality/,"

"The austere Greco-Roman columns mark the entrance to the 5,000 seat sanctuary. Housewives chatter while their husbands, somber in Sunday best, occasionally nod to each other. Children screech and my soul quavers. I step out of the car, filled with misgivings, my heart beating furiously. The asphalt glares up at me, accusing; the tar’s pitch black a reflection of the filth in my soul. Cornerstone Church, a non-denominational “place of worship,” gazes down at me from its spiritual pedestal. Somewhere inside those pristine white limestone walls, Pastor John Hagee waits – my soul is at stake and he will stop at nothing to save it. The immense glass doors challenge me to step inside, to believe, to be born-again. I stub out my cigarette, wrench open the portal of spiritual salvation and resolutely step into my very first megachurch experience.,Situated at the junction of Loop 1604 and Stone Oak Parkway on San Antonio’s wealthy Northeast side, Cornerstone Church juts out into the pulse of the cityscape, a monolith of pre-packaged, pre-heated Christianity. The flashing marquee, beyond colorfully announcing Pastor Hagee’s latest book, Jerusalem Countdown, also serves as a beacon to all those seeking salvation through the Word. Started in 1975, Cornerstone has grown from 100 to 18,000 members within thirty years – largely through the efforts of its founder and senior pastor, John C. Hagee. The sanctuary can seat over 5,000 people and its stage could accommodate a small circus. Beyond the sanctuary, there is the Vada Hagee Prayer Chapel, the Bythel Hagee Life Center, “A” and “B” Buildings, a bus barn, and the John Hagee Ministries International Media Center (home to 5 large satellite dishes, broadcasting the Truth to the far-corners of the world).,Cornerstone’s name is aptly given – as it is indeed, the cornerstone of what has become Hagee’s multimillion-dollar evangelical empire. Now an author of 11 books (several of which have occupied the #1 spot on the Times’ best-seller list), Pastor Hagee, or simply “Pastor,” is also the president and CEO of Global Evangelism Television as well as the president and centerpiece of the John Hagee Ministries. He entertains foreign dignitaries, speaks at conventions and sits on the board of directors at Oral Roberts University (a Christian university in Tulsa). And, apparently, is very well compensated for his efforts (to the tune of 1.25 million in 2001). His house (also in the Greco-Roman revival-style), is valued at over $650,000 and is in one of San Antonio’s wealthiest gated communities. His compensation package (larger than some Fortune 500 CEO’s) has raised eyebrows and ignited criticisms from other ministries. His detractors claim he is using the money from his donors (more than half of the JHM’s income is from donations) to bolster his net worth, marketing and selling products that return the profit to him – not to spreading the Gospel. But then again, you couldn’t expect the mouthpiece of God to entertain Prime Ministers of Israel in a duplex – or wear rags or turn water into wine, for that matter.,But, enough of the material. Let’s talk about the salvation of my eternal soul. Or, perhaps more precisely, how Cornerstone and Pastor Hagee went about trying to save it. Once inside the sanctuary, I am greeted with a huge display of brochures, announcements, and most importantly, catalogues. After all, how can I be expected to find God without the proper tools? I pick a few up and enter the sanctuary. After receiving the boot from my first three seats (apparently donors get seating preference), I find a spot in the north-northwest corner next to a man with a very large chin and in front of a woman with a very large family. The choir sings while the latecomers continue to trickle in. The words scroll by on the two massive screens: “Jesus sweeps me off my feet/Taking me so I can meet/The Lord, our God, his Word, so sweet” (rhyming is absolutely key to one’s relationship with the Lord). During vamps and key changes, hands shoot into the air. Some twitch, others sway, a few oddly grasp for the ceiling – but all channel God’s glory, their closed-eyed owners rapturously singing along.,About twenty minutes later, Associate Pastor Matthew Hagee (most beloved son of John C.) takes the stage for some announcements. Youthfire, the high-school aged fellowship group will be hosting the Jason Upton Worship Service (a most blessed Christian singer) on April 7th at 7:00 pm. Tickets are thirteen dollars in advance, but fifteen at the door – so “buy ‘em now, ‘cuz this guy saves!” The registration for the Search for Significance classes (finding self-esteem through Christ) will be closing on April 10th. A fee is necessary to cover administrative costs and other “essentials for the course,” so if you have already registered, please pay promptly. And if not, bring the checkbook to registration.,After announcements wrap up with hearty applause, the elder Hagee takes the stage to even heartier applause and shrieks of “Praise Jesus!” and “Bless Him!” The lesson begins simply enough. The theme for the month is “Promise, Problem, and Provision,” complete with a cunning drawing of a mountain and a path around it. I don’t really catch much of what Hagee says as after almost every sentence, the sanctuary drowns in applause, shouts and yells. But I can tell it is important because the man with the very large chin is constantly nodding while the woman with the very large family punctuates the lecture with “Praise Jesus!” and “Bobby, stop playing with that! He’s speaking the Word of the Lord!” Another twenty minutes roll by and I’m beginning to get caught up in it. There is an invigorating and genuine enthusiasm that permeates the gathering. Perhaps this is the way to find salvation, swept up in a sea of praise, surrounded by several thousand of my fellow beings. And then I’m blindsided, and the real sermon begins.,“Brothers and sisters, America is filled with deception,” Hagee begins, during a slight lull in the roar. “Deception in spades,” he repeats, his voice changing timbre. What deception? What is he talking about? The answer follows shortly.,“HARRY POTTER!” he roars, “WITCHCRAFT!  DEVILRY!  SATANISM!” he continues. “You let your child read that trash – you let Satan into your home.” But wait, Harry Potter is fighting Lord Voldemort – the epitome of all that is evil. Satan, if you will, in the form of a wizard. How is Harry Potter evi—,“FEMINISM IS DECEPTION!” he rants, changing tact, leaving my thoughts scrambling for a toehold. “Men and women were NOT created equal – and feminism is the demon that will deceive your household! Do NOT open the door for it!” What!? Where did that come from? What about your wife? Does she know you’re saying this? That’s she’s not your equal? And, just as quickly, the topic changes again.,“ABORTION IS DECEPTION!” he continues, his face taking on a scarlet tinge. “What is more EVIL than taking the life of the most innocent of all?” he says, “That’s right! Nothing! EXCEPT BELIEVING THAT THERE IS ANOTHER GOD BEYOND OUR ONE TRUE GOD IN HEAVEN AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST!!!”,The man with the very large chin had gone beyond mere nodding and now looked as though he was about to go into a seizure. The woman with the very large family was on her feet, shouting; hands wildly pumping the air, desperately seeking the Glory. Her children, all six of them, are also standing, screaming. I am alone in my silence, as shouts of “Speak it!” and “Praise Jesus!” wash over me. The entire congregation, except for those in wheelchairs, is on their feet, yelling, stamping, climbing on the pews. The entire scene is eerily reminiscent of the “Two Minutes Hate” of 1984 fame. And as the mass writhes in its spiritual orgasm, Hagee looks out across the floodwaters of holiness he has just let loose and slowly smiles, his sweating visage aglow. ,According to Wikipedia, my Alpha and Omega for information, a megachurch is simply a “large church, frequently defined as having more than 2,000 worshippers for a typical weekly service.” However, the term “megachurch” encompasses far more than a simple calculation of parishioners. Over the past couple of decades, a megachurch has come to represent exurban Christian America in thought, word, and deed. The megachurch is Christianity’s equivalent to Sam’s Club or Costco: bulk prayer, worship, and salvation for lower than your average retail value. And not only is redemption reasonably priced, it’s ready for consumption as soon as you walk in. Huge television screens beam down at you while the air resonates with the Word – pumped from massive speakers strategically placed around the sanctuary. The message is simple (usually alliterative in presentation). There are no hefty books to thumb through, no stations of the cross to remember, even Communion has become anachronistic. After all, the consummation of Christ’s covenant with humanity is far too personal and time-consuming an operation to conduct with 2,000 people every week. You’re praising Jesus with 1,999 other people and it’s great. Why be selfish? Praise songs with simple melodies and easy-to-learn lyrics have replaced the more complex hymns and spirituals (and who sings in Latin, anyway?).,And John Hagee has perfected this easily accessible, easily consumed version of Christianity at Cornerstone. He has pared down the commitment, time and energy one needs to devote to religion to the barest minimum. You simply show up at 8:30, 11:00 or 6:30 on Sunday and worship. For a little over an hour, you can cleanse your soul, praise the Lord and find peace. And you don’t need to strain yourself, either. The music is simple. The message is alliterative. And the energy of the Lord just floats around the room – all you have to do is lift up a hand and you can catch it. Your spiritual renewal complete, you can go about your business. Of course, donations are accepted. After all, how can John Hagee have the energy to whip your congregation into a jingoistic frenzy three times every week without his steak dinners?,As the congregation begins to settle down, the post-coital bliss in the air is palpable. People pant, their eyes glazed, the orgasmic power of spiritual salvation still suffusing their bodies. The band begins to play as the choir re-enters, singing something slow. The screens begin to scroll the lyrics as the congregation shakes itself from its dopamine high. The bass thumps through the pews. “Our God is a Mighty God/He Reigns on Heaven and Earth” rings through the sanctuary as Hagee takes the microphone.,“And that, brothers and sisters, that,” and he stops, his eyes magnified hundreds of times by the gigantic screens search the audience, “is the power of Christ.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/jesus_christ_supersized/,"

"It’s like one of those Twilight Zone epiphanies that arrives midway through an episode to thwart the lately begotten hopes and dreams of whatever poor fool thought he caught a lucky break or maybe had a good thing going. So get this. You’re living in Utah. You have a nice set-up in the suburbs. In fact, you have three of them, all in a row. You have a beautiful, devoted wife. In fact, you have three of them, all in a row. You’re a suburban polygamist living out the American Dream Supersized in a latter-day Canaan of lush green lawns, cool blue swimming pools, and wide well-paved roads crawling with plentiful herds of sports utility vehicles. You sleep with each of your alluring wives according to a nightly rotation. The best part is that you don’t even go to church: it’s like paradise sans the martyrdom; you get to have your cake and eat it too – all three delicious pieces every Sunday morning. But here comes the horrible catch. One evening, for no particular reason, you just can’t get it up anymore. (Cue gasps, sighs, gnashings of teeth.) ,Such are the domestic headaches which befall Bill Henrickson, the small-business-owner-cum-biblical-patriarch who is at the center of HBO’s new polygamy-themed series Big Love. Henrickson has two home improvement stores, three houses, three cars, three wives, and seven children. Not to mention a troublesome past and a volatile future. Big Love is a show about the day-to-day doings, travails, and laughs of the Henrickson family and the homey ménage a quatre that is their radical experiment in living. I can pay this show no greater compliment that to say that it earns its place on the HBO lineup, the network responsible for The Wire and The Sopranos. In this turbulent world of sexual revolution, gay marriage, ubiquitous pornography, and epidemic divorce, perhaps we can all steady ourselves on the moral certitude that HBO will always make great television no matter what should come charging over the sociological horizon.,Written and created by Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer, Big Love features an all-star cast. Tom Hanks puts in an appearance as executive producer, and Henrickson himself is played by lovable sleaze Bill Paxton. Paxton is flanked by the connubial troika of first-wife Barb, a perfect Jeanne Tripplehorn, petulant second-wife Nikki, played by Chloe Sevigny, and his bubbly naïf of a third wife Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin). Other notable characters include the lecherous and manipulative “prophet” Roman, well-played by Harry Dean Stanton, and the pretty yet chaste teenager Sarah Henrickson, played by Amanda Seyfried.,When most people hear the word polygamy, they probably envision some Ingres-esque retinue of voluptuous women lolling in luxury at the feet of a decadent sheikh. Or maybe they picture inbred hicks eking out their illiterate lives in those curious parts of America which make up for natural godforsakenness in native religiosity. While the former is an Orientalist caricature, the latter actually comes close to approximating life for those unlucky enough to inhabit the FLDS enclaves in Hillsdale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona. Members of the Fundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints (not to be confused with mainstream Mormons, who outlawed polygamy many years ago, something HBO is careful to emphasize) believe that a man must have at least three wives in order to get into heaven; they believe that these wives “complete” him. In these isolated communities, girls as young as 12 are married to men four or five times their age, some of whom already have a whole remuda of women at their disposal. Young men, on the other hand, are frequently run out of town in order to preserve a gender ratio congenial to the lusts of the aged.,In fact, when Bill Henrickson was 14, his father took him out of Juniper Creek, the fictional polygamous community mired in the usual poverty and backwardness associated with fundamentalism, and left him to fend for himself in the middle of Salt Lake City. Put into a plight like that, he could have chosen alcohol and the slough of Despond, but instead went in for self-reliance and Horatio-Alger-style heroic capitalism. When the first show begins, Bill Henrickson has morphed from urchin to entrepreneur and is affluent enough to handle three mortgage payments, though not without strain. However, he must hide the secret of his family from nosy neighbors, ward off the occasional extortion attempt fielded by denizens of Juniper Creek in the know, continue to manage his thriving business, and – most importantly – take on the paramount task of preserving an always fragile intrafamilial peace. Witness the discord which results when he has sex one morning with Margene even though Nikki’s night (and, by extension, sexual ration) technically starts that day at 9 AM. Despite the occasional flare-up of marital tensions, all four clearly love one another and seem committed to this polygamy thing, for better or worse. Jeanne Tripplehorn deserves special plaudits for her pitch-perfect portrayal of Barb, the infinitely conscientious and caring first-wife. She is simply a queen, and I mean that in the non-gay sense.,Unfortunately for the sensationalistic appetite, the Henricksons cleave to neither stereotype of polygamy (hicks or sheiks). Perhaps what is prima facie surprising about this show is its surface boringness – the relentlessly wholesome character of the Henricksons’ daily life. Maybe the show is too wholesome; it’s weirdly, hyperreally wholesome. For instance, if you’ve ever seen any sitcom ever, you’re familiar with the usual breadwinner homecoming sequence – honey-I’m-home kiss-the-wife hug-the-child, and so on – but this only makes seeing it in triplicate all the more farcical when Bill Henrickson greets his long train of family members, giving out a million kisses and hugs and tailored salutations. Bill, Barb, Nikki, and Margene together fill out a pretty typical picture of bourgeois suburbia – albeit one whose spotless stucco exterior belies the explosive secret of polygamy within. In this sense, the show resembles Desperate Housewives or Weeds, two shows which play against the staid propriety of suburban culture while exploiting the tension borne of the necessity for unceasing semblance.,The intro is pretty indicative of the kind of nimble humor underwriting this show. While Henrickson and his wives surreally skate on top of what appears to be a giant globe – a delicate dance of harmonious gliding and the like – our ears are treated to the ethereal sounds of the Beach Boys classic “God Only Knows.” In it, Carl Wilson sings a tender song of gratitude and devotion to his best gal with the sweetness of a heartfelt prayer. The chorus-line repeats, “God only knows what I’d be without you.” The mode of address is conspicuously second-person: Carl Wilson is thanking you and you specifically, especially. But the intro to Big Love, by linking up the chorus with a shot of all three Hendrickson matrons skating by, implies that each round of the chorus is directed to a different you/wife, neatly figuring the complex unity of the Henrickson family-unit.,To claim this show tacitly endorses polygamy – a hysterical accusation which many soi-disant “culture warriors” and Traditional Marriage Templars will no doubt rush to throw at that vast, pervasive, and subtile engine of the Devil, Pop Culture – makes about as much sense as claiming The Wire endorses drugs or The Sopranos endorses organized crime. Yet on the other hand, neither is it the case that Big Love paints a dogmatically negative portrait of polygamy, nor is it the case that The Sopranos somehow constitutes a grand apologia of mafia life. The strength of all three shows lies in the vividness and complexity with which they depict real human beings thrust into strange situations who must still carry the full fardel of being human – that is to say, in the exhilarating words of Stan Brakhage, “love, death, sex, birth, and the search for God.”  All things considered, one could do a lot worse than this show.,After Swede Levov’s first try at homemaking and living the American Pastoral went awry – if you remember, his daughter dabbled in terrorism and his wife in cuckoldry, he remarried and began a whole new family as if to blot away the past through sedulous labor, material accumulation, and heroic procreation. In some ways, I think this conceit of Levov’s gets at the peculiar Americanness of this show and its portrait of polygamy. Bill Henrickson is a polygamist pretending to be a normal suburbanite, but the real joke is that he’s more American than any of us. It’s the Jones who are not keeping up with him.  He’s the Israelite; we’re the Philistines. The fixation on quantity for quantity’s sake and love of the pure scale of things, the idea of the immigrant reinventing himself in the new land, the consumerist logic of acquisition as accomplishment. Henrickson’s possession of three wives is ultimately only the reductio ad absurdum of a certain American ethic, and it’s not even that absurd. His family is just the American family Supersized. At one point in the show, Bill Paxton says something business-related which is truly frightening:,“If I had three wishes, it would be to be Wal-Mart, to be Wal-Mart, to be Wal-Mart.” ,God help us all.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_polygamist_next_door/,"

"When I think of Baltimore I don’t think of hip-hop. Crabs and murder come to mind. If you want to argue with me as a Baltimore native, I can almost guarantee you are not from Baltimore just as much as a Greenwich kid is not from New York. Some of last-years most inspired hip-hop, however, came from a Baltimore-native, or maybe judging by the fact that he studied classical guitar at Berklee and maintains a bourgeoisie fascination with psychedelic rock – Hendrix and the whole Woodstock crowd – it came from a “Baltimore-native.”,Portnoy Edan’s fascination with music began like my own, bored in suburbia, dusting off old records. Unlike myself, he is a one-in-a-million inspired listener: honing his guitar on old Led Zeppelin Riffs, picking up on hip-hop after N.W.A. released Straight Outta Compton in 1988, riding his home-spun skills to the top music program in the country, striking out on his own, months short of a degree, but with a new technical mastery of sampling and producing and finally experimenting with lyrics for the same reason he picked up guitar in the first place – it’s lonely in your parents’ basement. ,Critics tout Edan as a triple-threat, producing, sampling and rapping, but they should add a fourth to the list – his knowledge of and facility for rock music. Despite the AM bombardment of rap-rock dreck by Clear Channel, few rappers have an ear for rock and roll. Rock seeps into Edan’s records as more than just an unconscious influence. Edan explores the boundary between hip-hop and rock, and in many respects his second album, “Beauty and the Beat,” is a rock album.,Rock exists as popular music because it is reproducible. The most cherished rock riffs of Hendrix are exalted because anyone can pick up a record and tirelessly attempt to reproduce his sound. This almost clichéd description of rock in America has launched countless admirers on their own musical explorations. Learning music is one and the same with learning to copy. From the neat, pre-packaged record, CD’s and MP3’s to the sheet music and online databases of chord changes, this popular medium distinguishes itself from ‘serious music’ by its seeming desire to be cited and copied. It’s a perfect musical form for American and British youth who share a propensity for boredom and nostalgia.,	This element of reproducibility is often cited as the weakness of hip-hop. The argument goes: incomprehensible vocalists shout nonsense over mindlessly looped samples. One can almost always detect a hint of jealousy in such rock snobbery, enraged that another music has usurped rock as the most succinct and reproducible music. Let’s face it, twelve-year-olds don’t sing along to the Beatles anymore, they spout Eminem’s vitriol only to have their iPods confiscated. Those same twelve-year-olds make music on Garageband and their Playstations, and the music they make, mashing together looped string and drum samples, is the technologically streamlined bastard child of hip-hop. Computers have replaced unwieldy turntables, and iPods have replaced boomboxes, but the song remains the same.,	More than any other artist today, Edan recognizes that if rock is compressed jazz, then hip-hop is compressed rock, and that he can take advantage of this dialectic bridge. His songs are crisp and self-contained, seldom running over the three-minute mark. The lead single, “I See Colors,” begins with the proclamation, “Prince Paul already used this loop, but I’ma keep it movin’ and put you up on the scoop.” With a nod back to the past, Edan says straight out that no one’s done it like this before. The moog effects swell upwards, and Edan unleashes a lyrical barrage full of absurd wordplay (“I take lettuce, onion, tomato, add a dab o’ mayo, plus the fish filet o’”) and gangsta-worthy mean mugging (“connect the dots with all the pussies making records, who couldn’t suck my dick or put the gloss on their upper lip”), all while admiring and one-upping the LSD-soaked riffs. ,	Between “I see Colours,” and the next track, “Fumbling over Words that Rhyme,” a compressed oral account of rap’s prehistory, Edan proves himself a veritable Funky Voltron, assembling all music rap traditions into a face-melting, 10-cyclinder juggernaut. It’s the wondrous love child of Transformers and the record collection of the brother you always wish you’d had seen through the sepia lens of “Almost Famous.”,“Fumbling over Words that Rhyme,” is the one moment of humility in the album, where the title downplays the power of the music. Even while kneeling at the altar tracing the narrative arc from Mel E Mel to the Five Fantastic to the Cold Crush Four, however, he seems to cheekily swallow that entire prehistory whole. “Torture Chamber” weaves a taught, claustrophobic narrative, making effective use of a guest-spot from Percee-P. Fortunately, Edan avoids the hip-hop faux pas of including too many guest-tracks. ,Those tracks that do feature his old friends from Boston seem crafted around thirty-second spots meant to highlight their best attributes. Percee-P snarls “Infernal heating, spitting like I bust a gun, make you suffer from eternal bleeding,” over bone-rattling snares in one of the best torture moments on a record since the opening to Wu Tang’s “Method Man.” On “Making Planets” it’s Def Jux star Mr. Lif’s turn to impress. Over a meandering bass line and between a psych-rock guitar chorus worthy of the laid-back rhymes and 10-pound dreadlocked coif he’s known for, Lif describes the labor (or lack thereof) of making his own planet: “I frolic in the sand with the colony of ants, my particles expand building oxygen and plants.” Clearly Edan views the creative process as something transcendent, taking a wild joy in playing god, creating musical planets out of his celestial toolbox.,In his Baltimore basement, Edan has carved his name across the forty-year span of rock and hip-hop. “Rock and Roll” melds Velvet Underground and Black Sabbath into feedback-frayed banger that would play comfortably in Queens circa ’88, or the Filmore East circa ’68. This kind of mad-scientist approach embodies the best of rock and roll. ,Until hearing this album I never would have guessed that looking back forty-years would breathe new life into hip-hop, but then again, I never would have guessed the best MC alive grew up in Baltimore.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/straight_outtabaltimore/,"

"Disappointment characterized not the first birth, but the second in the amniotic procession the twins enacted on May 16, 1978. It was the first of many staged productions for the energetic children of withered opera rose Emilia Hemmings. Emilia knew just what she was getting, no surprises for her. Only two months earlier, peering into the murky flourishes of stratus cloud-like ultrasound pixelation prompted the doctor to declare twins, female. Emilia’s Flashbulb-Fuchsia colored nails clutched the paper-covered sides of the examination table in glee, barely able to contain her excitement.,At the time of the second table-clutch, Emilia saw that her twins weren’t as identical as she had expected. Her husband, Ernest, mistook the look of anguish on her face for exhaustion. As she was brought each child, one in a pink blanket, the other in blue, she looked back and forth between them, amazed at one, confused by the other.  ,“I’d rather have pink blankets for them both Ernest” she whispered hoarsely.  Ernest was excellent at taking care of things (It was he who had gotten out of the doctor the real story, that an errant leg had concealed the bit of flesh that might have given Emilia some warning). Not wanting to upset her, he carefully rushed off, to take care of things.  ,“And what will be their names?” the nurse asked, pen poised above the birth certificate. ,“Marcelline, and….and….Ernest…ine” said Emilia.  The nurse eyed her, but Emilia met the gaze and returned it twofold. Ernest reappeared, the blue blanket was exchanged for pink, and Emilia breathed a little more easily. She held the luminous creatures, admiring their rosied patinas.  ,“Ernest darling, I named one of the babies after you.”,***,Emilia walked proudly with her tandem stroller, children in matching ruffled dresses and socks with fold-over embroidered cuffs that fanned out around their plump little legs like gossamer mushroom caps.  She ran into a young blonde woman, who was jogging with a pink sweatband on. ,“Your girls are beautiful” she said in the obligatory tone-of-amazement reserved for bestowing compliments upon another’s offspring.  ,“They are, aren’t they?” Emilia responded, basking in the compliment. Why should she correct her?  Was it her fault that they looked so alike? They were twins.,***,I didn’t learn how to unfasten a woman’s undergarment the usual way. Nor did I learn at the usual age.,“Ernestine!  Come here, I need you!”,“Here I am Mommy.” ,“I can’t fasten this, come here, be my angel and…yes that’s it, just put the hook into the eye, make sure you get all three….”,“One keeps coming out when I try and put the other one—”,“Just try and put them in all at the same time!  Hurry, we have five minutes.”,“It’s not working.”,“Here sweetie, look, I’ll show you.  See how I do it on you?” She slipped the beige loops over my arms, fixed the cups in place on my flat chest, and in a swift movement, demonstrated, while I looked over my shoulder into the mirror how the fastening was to be done, in one confident, synchronized, hooking motion.,“Please honey, now try on me, I just can’t quite reach.” After some fumbling, I did it. Then mother stood up, satisfied, and grasped my shoulders, turning both of us towards the mirror. “Look at us! We’re quite the pair, aren’t we?” Wearing the bra encouraged inside me an indescribable inflorescence. A trill of dangerous excitement, a wave of shame, and an afterglow of arousal. I laughed, feeling uncomfortable and also conspiratorial.,***,“Mommy, are you in there?”,“Who is it?”,“It’s me, Ernest.  Can I come in?”  I heard Marcelline howl in protest.,“Sweetie, I’m dressing, so right now this is a ladies-only place.” That was my cue. I put on the sweeter, higher pitched contra-tenor that she had taught me. I was wearing my best smocked housedress, with geraniums embroidered around the collar. This was a day-time only dress, since Mommy said Daddy didn’t like dresses.,“May I come in?”,“Ah, Ernestine, is that you!” Emilia said excitedly “Come help Mommy get ready.”,And when I entered, I really was Ernestine. As Ernestine, I was equal to her cherished Marcelline.Together we were free to indulge in what we called the ‘marvelous.’ We looked at her collection of buttons and fancied who the original owners had been. I listened to the tickling sounds of perfume bottles clinking together, and she told stories about the men who had purchased them for her. She would braid my hair, smooth creams onto my hands to make them softer, efforts at keeping that naughty Little Ernest at bay. Emilia’s hands were already well initiated into the signs of aging, like a peachy iced-over pond mottled with the cracks and  cuts of skaters long past. She loved having her little ‘Tine smooth them over with lavender cream. Then, she would let Marcelline paint her nails, long and ovaline, a deep blood-ripe aubergine color like the wellings of a small pin prick, transforming them to carefully domesticated talons. ,***,The feeling of my thigh flesh rubbing together, but not quite, was a delightfully foreign one. Each leg touched the other, but was separated by the diaphanous, scratchy-in-the-silkiest-of-ways material.   ,“Stop squirming, they aren’t pulled up all the way yet.” Marcelline yanked the waist band up a little more, forcing the nylon right up into the crest between my legs. I winced and wriggled. It embarrassed me to do this in front of people other than my mother and sister.  ,But it was Emilia’s birthday, and we had created a little drama centered around her favorite painting. Today’s production would be about Degas and his dancers. We had decided to forego choreography in favor of improvisation but had troubled ourselves to write dialogue. Marcelline, true to megalomaniacal form, would play the role of Degas. I would be a ballerina.	,Staging these shows was one of those embarrassing family rituals that exists purely behind closed doors.  Big Ernest’s legs were impatiently crossed. Emilia sat forward on the sofa, just on the edge, with her shoulders back and her eyes wide, her head bobbing in encouragement  Marcelline flicked the light switch on.,There I was, pale torso and sloping shoulders clad in a leotard which made my rib cage bulge like little cnidarian bellows, forcing their wing-like contours over the top of my dancer’s skirt.  A matching ribbon was sweetly cocked above my brow. I attempted futilely to lift a stockinged leg up onto the mantel, a stand-in for the traditional barre, but it was too high and made a comedy of my various warm-up poses. Marcelline came on stage wearing a beret, a monocle, and a marker-scrawled beard. She held in her left hand a malformed wood slab, her thumb poking through to support it, and in her right hand she juggled two paintbrushes and a long thinly tapered cigarette holder.  ,As I traipsed delicately around the living room carpet, Marcelline positioned herself in a corner and began to make exaggerated scrawling marks with the paintbrushes on a hidden canvas. Then her dialogue began. She was the mastermind, the star, of these productions, and she delivered every line as if it were an exclamation, a wise proclamation of grave importance, perhaps uttered by someone like James Earl Jones.,“Little dancer, how pretty you are!” ,I kept on dancing.,“I could paint you for hours and hours!  But what shall we do when it get’s dark outside? I will no longer be able to paint, and you will no longer be able to dance!”  She pulled a sad face and dashed her paintbrushes to the ground, growling in a mock low-pitched voice,“It’s no use! [ hand thrust to forehead in mock-faint pose] How I must suffer!”  She flung the palette sideways, a violent boomerang that threatened to crash into the crystal decanters on the credenza. ,At this point I became afraid, seeing how Big Ernest’s bristling eyebrows had followed the catapulted prop, and cried out, “Be careful!” which prompted Marcelline to shout and shake her arms in admonishing incredulity.,“The fourth wall Ernest!  The fourth wall!”  ,I then sat in the middle of the stage, my blond hair shining despondently in rings around the crown of my head.,“You’ve broken it!” Marcelline wailed, arms falling and slapping her thighs in frustration.  ,“No I haven’t, you were the one who threw it, and it missed anyway.”,“No, Ernest,” she heaved contemptuously, “you’ve broken the fourth wall.”,***,I sat staring straight ahead, chin in hands for thirteen minutes this afternoon, the whole time focusing on the new blue plaid comforter my father had purchased for my bedroom. Over it I had laid out my collection.  Of the numerous confections Emilia had secretly been buying me, I had two different garter belts, one pale yellow, the other a sweet coral; eight brassieres of varying lace intricacy (and one with conical, 1950’s cups!); four pairs of nylons, three differently colored, and one a special fancy pair with fan perforations (which created what I felt was a more elegant take on the fishnet look); and nine different pairs of panties. Soon I would be needing a new bra, to make evenly matched pairs. It all looked vile on this new bedspread.  But the bedspread helped me play my part in a blue plaid life. ,Big Ernest stepped in quietly to see his boy lying prostrate at the curated intimates.  At this point, a decision was made, and things might have gone two different ways, or maybe even five or eight or sixteen different ways. Big Ernest could have looked on in personal dissatisfaction, in quiet grief, perhaps with a tear squeezed down his ridged cheek. Big Ernest could have left, silently closing the door behind him.  But Big Ernest did none of these things.,Big Ernest roared mightily. ,“What in GOD’s name do you THINK you’re doing?!!”,Terrified silence, followed by more terrified silence and stricken eyeballs.,“This has gone on… too long!  No son of mine will be some sissy boy pussy,” he hissed between gritted teeth. My father grabbed me and dragged me over to my desk. “Scissors! Get the scissors!” ,I looked at the pencil cup that held a large pair of shears. ,With a menacing look, Big Ernest roared “NOW.” ,No sooner had I quickly grasped the handles than my father had thrown me violently to the bed. I was shaking so hard that the two scissor blades rattled together, a lilting counterpoint to the symphonic rage.  Big Ernest took slow deliberate steps towards the bed, looked around its surface, and selected the coral garter belt set. He dangled it over me hatefully. With a disdainful drop, the garment fell on my face. I felt asphyxiated. “DESTROY IT.”  ,My face flooded with tears that darkened the coral material, expanding fiercely into red stains. I tentatively sliced into them, as if they were part of me. Soon, I was surrounded in tatters, eviscerated.  He supervised as I ruined my trove, howling for my mother, mucus pouring from my mouth and nose.  In the hallway, with her back against the closed bedroom door, fluids similarly emitted from Emilia, choking her. Black veins materialized on her face as her mascara ran, resembling stuck-on bits of waterlogged, carbon lace. ,I sat in the frothy, multi-colored entrails of shredded fabric. All the while, Big Ernest paced the room, throwing his hands up in the air and doing a frightening jittery dance while slovenly muttering under his breath questions like “Is this what you want! To be a freak?” and “How will you ever become anything like this?” or “What have I done wrong? Why did I let Emilia indulge herself?” and “My boy is going to be a queer isn’t he?” and finally, more audibly, “Why can’t you be more like your sister?”,***,The first of seven visits that abruptly ended when Emilia threatened abandonment and divorce (less easily hidden than a sexually perverse son) was a humiliating one. Big Ernest had discreetly found an agreeable (read: coercable) doctor to handle me and my sickness.,I sat in a mildew green chair, in a paper gown, looking like an uncomfortable paper crane. Beneath the folds, my waxing and waning tumescence was monitored by the penile plethysmograph Dr. Pheonix’s nurse had affixed to me.  In front of me, a small screen projected images that shifted every fifteen seconds. The first session, I had been made to sit there and look for a full half hour. A lollipop, a grassy field, a woman in a swimming pool, a penguin, a man playing tennis, a penis, a puppy, a book, a farm, nylon stockings, a mountain, snow, two large breasts. I sat there, noticing my own swelling and shrinking. I was encouraged to tell stories about how I was feeling during this interactive shame montage.  No matter how hard I tried to control it, I found I couldn’t. Two people sat in an adjoining room, looking at their own smaller screen, interpreting what my responses meant. As I became engorged and displaced air in the glass shaft, the displaced air told my observers just how unacceptable I was and to what degree, up to six significant digits.,***,Marcelline and I lay side by side, ensconced in our twin beds. I couldn’t sleep,“What’s wrong, why are you fidgeting?”,“I don’t know.” And then, “Marce, am I still young enough to play your ingénue?”,“You know how dad gets about the shows. And your shoulders, too broad. What kind of ingénue looks self-sufficient?  You’re on the em-effing football team.” ,“So I’m too old?”,“Just not ingénue-young”,“I’m only fifteen,” I moaned.,“And fifteen is old,” she responded.  “We’ve already missed so many opportunities.  For example, if we wanted to become prodigies at any discipline, any discipline at all, we would have had to choose it and begin way before now. And,” she continued, “We’ve reached that age when we’re no longer attractive to pedophiles. It’s too late,” She said with a great sigh.,“Yes,” I agreed.,***,Our jackets were speckled with streaks of olive, yellow, umber – a collage of faux foliage to confuse both potential targets and predators. We wore stiff leather boots, with laces held up the ankles by steel pegs.  ,After Marcelline had informed me that play was over, I knew it was time to change. Thus, rifle team.,I nestled the butt into my shoulder, cradling softly before pulling the trigger. That moment, when everything is quiet and still, just before the projectile is launched, is full of excruciating tension, a pinched short- breathed feeling of anticipation and fear and wonder. You know what will happen, you can even visualize the feel of the kick back, but every time it happens it is still miraculous.,“Ok, let’s get her,” Jonas whispered.,A slight faun ambled sixty feet off to our left. Everyone froze, and then pivoted slowly. It reminded me of a dance Marcelline and I did once. A slow, dramatic pivot, moving our arms like the Shiva Tandava and humming in loud, nasal whines, attempting to create overtones (that had been for ‘It’s A Beautiful Day in the Bollyhood’).  ,“It’s too small, Jonas,” I protested.,“Its alive, and we have guns,” he replied. “Alright, guy who gets it gets to do my girlfriend tonight.”,Things cocked, things aimed, eyes focused, index fingers stroked, flirting with the sweetest spot until a flurry of cracks scattered into the forest. I hadn’t fired. I’d wanted to. I just hadn’t. The histrionics were there, but without delivery.  ,“I am totally nailing Lisa tonight!” I cheered to disguise my inaction, arms raised skyward. I immediately regretted this, because as my arms raised, I felt underwires tickling my chest, making my body hairs bristle, causing another part of my body to raise. My face fell and the gloating cheer dwindled into a strained remark. I may have convinced Dr. Pheonix over time that I was better, and I became more adept at concealing things from my father, but under no circumstances had I been able or even desired to cease my collecting.  In fact, its forbidden nature had pushed me into wearing my treasures in situations where I could feel the delicious endangerment that accompanied the possibility of being discovered.    ,“You really think I would let any of you do Lisa?  I shot that bitch fair and square, just like I knew I would.  Check the bullet if you don’t believe me,” Jonas retorted.,In the truck back to school, we discussed strategy for the skeet match next week.  Back on campus, we headed for our lockers.  Jonas came up behind me and tripped me.  I went sprawling as he chuckled,,“That’s payback for Lisa”  ,Lying on the floor, I could feel just the slightest sliver of my lower back exposed – the camouflage jacket had ridden up during the fall, just as my pants had ridden down –  and now four guys were staring at my silk covered ass.,“Holy shit,” breathed Jonas.,***,A barbed giggle fanned out from an intimate crew that sat in a way that so fully excluded me. It danced, funneling inside the pink of my ear until it slipped inside, and all I could wonder was ‘was that about me’ ,If I thought I was friendless before, I was flirting with desolation now. The guys constantly reminded me of their disdain with fresh lascerations, bruises, or welts on any or all parts of my body.  ,“Football practice is getting rough now that I made Varsity” was what I told Big Ernest when he asked after my weekly-mauled face.  He wasn’t the only one who had noticed a change.,“Are you okay Ernest?” I heard a small voice ask after last Tuesday, when Jonas had dumped me out of the flatbed of his truck and into a pile of mulch.,After taking me home for band-aids, Lisa, of Jonas’-pimping-out-his-girlfriend fame, revealed a side of her that needed to nurture.  Specifically, a side that needed to nurture whilst sticking it to Jonas.  Who was I to protest?,In just a week, we were in her basement on her plaid sofa after school, 4 pm, constantly vigilant for the sound of a key in the front door. I felt that familiar tingling when I saw her shirt lift, which became an insistent strain once the shirt was flung to the floor.,We clumsily squirmed on her couch for a while in the beautiful, un-choreographed dance of sexual novices, dances that can only be done a certain number of times. Then my fingers felt hook and eye.,Now, doing it on someone who wasn’t Emilia felt exhilarating and like betrayal.,Feeling the flare of hips, being able to trace the inward, magnetic pull of the small of her back that announced the enticing jut beneath, I felt dizzy with my clumsy, clamoring desire. But more interesting than her actual body was this act of undressing, or really not even undressing, but being able to behold her body clad in the trappings of females. I dropped my hands, trying to turn her around, so that I could look more fully upon her, but she kept guiding my hands back to that latched place. A place I didn’t really care to go, unless I could keep the artifact of the trick.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/camouflage-excerpt/,"

"It is Spanish medieval history meets German 20th century history. It is Heart of Darkness meets Mein Kampf. It is glory meets madness. It is conquest meets greed. It is Herzog meets Kinski. It is abjection meets addiction. This is Werner Herzog’s 1972 Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (Aguirre, The Wrath of God) starring Klaus Kinski, German acting idol, which was re-shown this past week in New York. ,The film opens with Don Pizarro’s (Alejandro Repulles) expedition descending the Andes. A small army zig-zags down the side of a mountain in single file while the voice of Brother Carvajal (Del Negro) reads from his diary of the voyage. And then appears Don Lope de Aguirre, played by the enigmatic Klaus Kinski, the Wrath of God himself. He saunters past the soldiers and slaves, whipping them indiscriminately in passing, like it “ain’t no thing.” ,History presages that Pizarro’s expedition takes a turn for a worse. Supplies being short, the Spanish explorer decides to set up camp and send a smaller mission to scout ahead in search of the El Dorado, the fabled Seven Cities of Gold. His speech explaining these decisions is extremely awkward, as it seems to address soldiers and slaves alike. Or could it just be an amateur delivery? Who knows?,“Who cares?” is more accurate. It is Aguirre/Kinski who steals the show. The second in command is assigned to a side mission but strikes fear into the hearts of all – including his superiors – with his crushing stare. “Aguirre” they whisper, “he will ruin us all.” ,And he does. As the small band of men rafts through the jungle they are assailed by natives, starvation, and the sheer power of the jungle. The commander, Don Ursua (Ruy Guerra), decides to turn back once the rafts are swept away in the night (was it really the river?), but Aguirre will have none of it. He was never having any of it. He leads a mutiny against the appointed commander, only to appoint the fat nobleman Guzman (Peter Berling) as the new figurehead commander. ,Finally. Finally Aguirre is in control. And finally Kinski is the absolute center of attraction in this film, so that I can tell the reader all about this fascinating and addictive man. Klaus Kinski was insane. He said so himself. You think I am using the word lightly? During the filming of this movie, some of his colleagues were playing cards in a hut on the set. The noise from the hut irritated Kinski so much that he fired three shots at it and blew the top joint of the finger of one of the extras. Trust me, the man was loco. ,But I can say without a doubt that he was also the greatest German actor that ever lived. His blond hair, grooved face – which seems chiseled from rock – and bulging, steel-blue eyes make him the uncontested poster child of Teutonic ferocity.,The director is almost as iconic and brilliant as the actor. And Herzog was no less insane than his favorite actor (he merely kept it implicit). When Kinski wanted Herzog to fire a sound technician with whom he couldn’t work (how closely do actors and sound technicians have to work together?), Herzog refused. When Kinski decided to leave the set and the jungle, Herzog threatened to kill first the actor and then himself. Some might believe he was bluffing. That this threat had the strength to make Kinski stay and finish the film makes me think the director was for real. ,Maybe the above description of Aguirre/Kinski strikes readers as a little too… uh, Arian for comfort? Well it should. Herzog may be retelling a historical tale about Spanish conquest and greed, but he is intentionally infusing it with deeper Germanic references. The minute Kinski shows himself on screen in all his bottled rage and fury, the German in me was waiting for him to break the lingual mold of translated medieval Spanish and give us a real tour de force of 20th century German swearing. “Scheisse!” he yells when the cannon gets stuck in the mud. “Arschloch!” he insults some poor idiot, in addition to whipping him. It would not be the same in any other language, or spoken by any other character. German curse words uttered by the blond and blue-eyed Wrath of God himself. ,As the mini-expedition travels further down the river, “The horror! The horror!” becomes more and more apparent, and Herzog’s reference to the Third Reich increasingly obvious. When the Spaniards storm an abandoned village, Aguirre decides to drive his black slave naked before him, thinking it will scare the natives. When his men, crazed with hunger, feast themselves on a bunch of bananas he hacks away at them (the men, not the bananas) with his sword. One of them plans to desert the lunatic; Aguirre has his henchman behead the poor SOB. A less diplomatic man could never be found. ,In and of itself, Aguirre’s behavior is not what is horrifying. There are plenty of films that tell stories of ruthless and crazy men. What is truly frightening is that this isn’t Aguirre we are seeing, it’s Kinski and he exists beyond the silver-screen. (Well, actually, Kinski died in 1991 so I guess everyone can rest easy.) A thought made all the more discomforting by the final scene.,After South American natives kill everyone on the raft, including Aguirre’s daughter (equally blond and equally blue-eyed as her father), only the crazed nobleman remains. It all comes together in this last scene. Out of nowhere, hundreds of squirrel monkeys appear on the raft, gathering in various spaces. Kinski ambles after them, catching one, lifting it, dropping it back on the deck. ,All the while he speaks to the monkeys. He tells them of the conquest they will make together as they press on. He explains his companions’ disdainful desire for gold and how he instead wishes for something grander and more majestic. He claims he will marry his daughter, establishing a dynasty pure and eternal, the likes of which the world has never seen.,I’m pretty sure Adolf Hitler had similar ideas and dreams. Despite the fact that Aguirre: The Wrath of God is set in 16th century South America, the story of human greed and megalomania it tells is not universal. The Arian Klaus Kinski brings the message home to the fatherland in the most discomposing way. He stares directly at the camera in the appalling final scene, confronting me with his madness. I can’t wait to get away from his overwhelming gaze. At the same time, I know I am going to go out and buy every single Kinski film the next chance I get.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_wrath_of_the_fatherland/,"

"Denver was becoming acutely aware that at this moment in the road trip, where a second wind might have kicked in, not even the slightest of breezes was blowing.,â€œI know! Lets not go, letâ€™s go somewhere else, we can drive to Tennessee or California, or Texas!â€ ,â€œWe have to go.  Nickâ€™s expecting us, and I just donâ€™t want to let him down,â€ James said. Actually, he was the person most excited for the trip.  He had spent all night procuring an eighth of an ounce of the finest pot east of the Mississippi.,â€œI donâ€™t know if Ill be able to stand drinking tequila and speaking foreign languages all day.  I got so annoyed last time when everyone decided that Turkish was a natural part of every personâ€™s core knowledge.  They all think Iâ€™m an idiot,â€ Denver warned.  Jamesâ€™ friends were all over-educated, upwardly mobile (whatever that meant) American expatriates located in the New York environs, hunkering down and waiting for the Euro to get better before they made it official.  Or, to say it another way, spoiled.  Or, yet another way, pretentious bourgeois cowards.  Thatâ€™s according to Denver, of course. She loathed being patronized.,â€œThen drink wine.â€ James offered, as Tristan und Isolde melted into â€œHey Judeâ€.,Denver killed the next twenty minutes telling James about the terrible dreams sheâ€™d been having in the days leading up to their trip, hoping to garner some more sympathy and perhaps even effect a change in plans.,â€œThey arenâ€™t really sequential narratives, more like cinematic stills in which I can both spectate and participate.  And Iâ€™m not really in a specific setting, but just, like, a genericâ€¦..environment.  My face appears in these three-quarter profile shots, Laocoon-like, with this expression that is just the stillest agony youâ€™ve ever seen or felt, and then, my teeth begin to soften, dissolve, and crumble, coming out in sawed off shards, juicy bloody bits of gum and gristle still clinging.â€  Other variations of this dream included coughing accompanied by a flurry of teeth tumbling into her cupped hand, or lifting a pear to her mouth, and, as she tore into the soft fragrant meat, her teeth would stay there, lodged in the pear skin.  The act of eating, an inherently additive act, became one of subtraction.,â€œSo textbook,â€ observed James. â€œCouldnâ€™t be more predictable if you tried.â€,â€œWell I didnâ€™t try,â€ she said flatly.  â€œItâ€™s a dream.â€,â€œWell.â€ James said.,And, after a few minutes of silence:,â€œItâ€™s not an anxiety dream, if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re thinking,â€ Denver asserted.,â€œOf course it is.  Fear stems from anxiety.  And I mean, you were the one that announced it as a nightmare, which must, you know, imply some aspect of fear.  And, I think we both know you arenâ€™t exactly overjoyed to see these people again.  Maybe a little scared, huh?â€ James argued. Then a quick and sloppy caveat. â€œBut you know there is no reason to be scared, you know I think you are twice as intelligent as any one of them is.â€ She inhaled and sighed. ,â€œMaybe.  Iâ€™m going back to sleep. Iâ€™ll try to dream more originally this time.â€  She turned her shoulders in onto herself, and cradled her body against the door.    James stared straight ahead, and then glanced over at Denver to see if she was looking at him.  She had pulled most of her white cotton shirt up over her face to block out the light.  It threw her profile into a stark snowy relief that resembled the frosty Appalachians that swelled around the empty road. The soft space revealed beneath her rib cage made his eyes momentarily go out of focus.  He reached over and stroked her stomach with a fond finger.  She emitted a murmur that diminuendoed into a soft appoggiatura, announcing her descent into a drowsy, uncomfortable slumber.,An hour fifteen later, Denverâ€™s mouth opened wide to expel raspy, hoarse air frantically on the car window, condensate that exploded like a plump, round firework in a glass sky.  She twitched, sat up, and after re-acclimating herself to the waking world, she turned to him and breathed,,â€œAlligators.â€,â€œWhat?â€,â€œAlligators, in a lake, one swam right up from under me, then past me.  Its knobbed back touched my foot.  I was with my sister.  And I couldnâ€™t scream out to her.â€,â€œSo no more teeth?â€ he said warmly, part hoping to make light of their little squabble earlier, part trying to stick the knife in deeper.,â€œAre you kidding me? Of course there were teeth.  Alligators.â€ she said, more emphatically.,â€œRight, but not your teeth.â€  ,A little while later, while wallowing in passive aggressive silence, Denver decided to take her frustrations public.,â€œWhat will happen to us in ten years, do you think?â€  She wasnâ€™t sure what she was trying to start., â€œWhat is the point of asking that question?â€ James asked.,â€œWell.  What else is there to do now? I just want to know.  In case I should jump ship or something.  Do you even think itâ€™s even possible for people to desire each other after sustained familiarity?â€ ,â€œWell, weâ€™ve been together six years, havenâ€™t we?  I hate it when you talk like this. Donâ€™t worry about stuff like this nowâ€,â€œIâ€™m not worrying, just wondering. I mean, weâ€™ve been in a car for only a few hours, and weâ€™re sort of at each otherâ€™s throats.â€,Part of her was annoyed that he was taking her completely seriously, and kind of scared that he wasnâ€™t immediately denying all possibility of such an eventuality.  She wanted him to say she was crazy, and that no matter what happened, they would always be hot for each other.  Yet another part of her was annoyed that if he was taking this seriously, and thus believed it could and would happen, then why wasnâ€™t he willing to discuss it.  Aging was inevitable.  She had no tricks up her sleeve and she didnâ€™t work out enough.  She knew she took her youth for granted.  But what was her alternative?  Waste all her time preparing for her an unattainable ageless future, whittle the hours away on a treadmill under fluorescent lighting, squander paychecks on hundred dollar ounces of whale fat cream, or best, let someone slice her face up and re-arrange it like one of those moveable picture puzzles?  She remembered from her history class in college a noblewoman, probably a Medici or something, who had killed over six hundred young maidens, stringing them up by the feet, slitting their throats, and draining their blood so that she could bathe in it.  She believed that it would make her young-looking again.  Denver lacked that kind of commitment. It would be wrinkly old age for her, she thought to herself. After a pause, she said, still trying to engage James on the subject, ,â€œWeâ€™re both going to get saggy and fatter.  It happens to everyone.  My skin will get all sponge-like, the little pores on my face will become larger holes, my eyes will recede into flaps of skin.  Itâ€™s going to be gross.  Your ears will probably grow at least three inches, and the hair in them three inches more.â€  What extinguished desire?  She imagined that after ten years they might both look at each other and feel as if their partner had mutated into some beastly, albeit vaguely familiar, creature. And even if warped appearances didnâ€™t snuff out amorous feelings, wouldnâ€™t mere desensitization eventually get the job done?,James didnâ€™t understand inquisitive anxiety as opposed to real, worry-inducing anxiety.  So he wasnâ€™t willing to discuss it, even as an intellectual topic of conversation.  After a bit more driving, he finally spotted something by the side of the road near Wingdale, N.Y. James pointed to Denver.,â€œLook, just like you wanted. Texas!â€ A neon sign read â€œRosemaryâ€™s Texas Taco.â€  They pulled into the driveway of the psychedelically colored house, whose lawn was littered with old urns, carousel creatures, and Playskool playhouses. Wind-mill sculptures and wind-chimes chattered casually. The trees on the property were all hung with strings of beads and cut glass.  ,When they got out of the car, Denverâ€™s spirits lifted.  Up against the slush-stained white fender, Denverâ€™s skirt lavished the side of the car as James sidled his face up to hers.  ,â€œWeâ€™re going to have a wonderful weekendâ€ James whispered conciliatorily.  â€œIâ€™m not going to let an alligator touch you.  Not one nibble.â€",http://www.nassauweekly.com/rosemarys_texas_taco/,"

"“Ten minutes on the egg-timer…and…go!” I barked softly.,The carpeted block staged the model’s gangly flesh, her nakedness roosting on fuzzy gray institutional carpeting. Her back was slightly arched, and her breasts quivered over her ribcage, puddling like melted peach snowcones.  ,Her left leg was bent at the knee, foot resting just below her buttock, forming a steeply sloped isosceles triangle. The other leg splayed, foot listing lazily outward. ,Around the model, hands armed with charcoal, smelling of acrid willow, waited for me to say “Time.” Each girl looked intently from model to easel, eyes batting back and forth like frantically signaling fans. ,My class is reserved for art concentrators in the high school, and only the good ones. I mainly handpick them myself, so applying is pretty useless. We convene on Wednesdays from 4:30-5:30, deliberately simultaneous with sports practices so as to avoid the errant athlete’s ogling drop-bys and awkward giggles.,I never draw with my class. Instead, I circle the room in hawkish observation, a panopticon dance. If I stopped, you knew someone had gone astray. ,“Kelly, are you using your pencil to measure the angles?”,“Trying, Mr. Lehman” she said, squinting and holding the pencil out in front of her like a baton, twirling it this way and that to see the proportional relationships.,“Then why is her head the same size as her hand?” Kelly took a step backwards, and immediately saw that the head on her drawing looked like those miniature heads cannibals keep in jars.,I always have to tell them to step back. You have to step back sometimes to see the whole picture. Everyone tends to get closer, trying to penetrate and capture and achieve mastery. But it’s like Seurat: the closer you get, the more sense deteriorates, the more it devolves into the grain of the undesirable.,“Lisa, just get a general idea of the figure. You can’t start out drawing her profile. Too detailed. You only have three minutes left, and I want the whole figure rendered, on the page.” ,The egg timer ticked on.,It’s important to have a goal, or at least something important to you so that you not only know what you want, but what you don’t want.,Here’s what I want: Celine.,She is my best student. And she knows it. Her name glimmers the way subtle gossamers on tea dresses do. When spoken, it shimmies through my body, effervescing from solar plexus to throbbing extremities. ,As Celine’s hand worked over the creamy page, the hips of her thumb undulated delightfully, a little fleshy half-wine bottle, like the optical illusion which is either a curvy vase or two shapely faces meeting in a lover’s embrace. ,It started when she would creep in during her free periods, munching the voluptuous green of an apple, or toying with a banana, inserting her pointer deep into the tip so that it broke down into three spears of soft fruit.,“Want some?” she would ask.,Earlier this morning, her fingers were wrestling with a stubborn orange peel. I was preparing an etching for the press when she walked in, crawled up to the model platform, and perched next to my hand, which was busy inking the copper plate with a roller, pressing back and forth the ink into the crevices. ,“Let’s switch” Celine suggested. She looked askance at the roller, and the luxuriously oozy, thick paint. I put down the roller, and leaned towards her, removing the orange from her palm. As I leaned in close to her neck, I could feel for a fleeting moment my own breath reflected on to my face as it exhaled from my mouth and bounced back off of her skin. ,She toyed with the viscous black, relishing the smacking, slurping sounds it made against plastic. While I watched her black out the plate, I carefully and slowly delved my fingers into the sweet pulp of the fruit, excavating treasure from rough zest.  ,Now, as she worked, my eyes salivated, not wanting to tear myself away from the carbon cane, but not wanting to miss a glimpse of eyes like broken glacier-bits. The model’s pallid weeping willow epidermis only antagonized, making me imagine what it would be to see instead that cherubic creature ablaze in her bareness.,I didn’t feel completely terrible. She’s an adult. And we all have a right to cultivate obsession. ,“Alright, so same thing, but more time. Really flesh it out, OK?” ,This was the last drawing, a long one, so I went to clean my office, so I could leave when the girls did. Also, it gave them time to work without feeling watched. I say feeling, because one of my office walls is a large window that looks down into the studio from above.,As I look at his picture sitting plaintively on my desk, my son Ryland’s face makes me remember why I was a conscientious objector. I was so protective of that soft spot on his doughy head where the skull still formed. Like reverse continental drift. ,Before, I was conscientious that I was a selfish artist that didn’t care for physical activity or Canada. And, I was an objector because I especially didn’t care for physical activity that involved killing other people or risking my life. But now, I had something besides myself, something so deeply knotted into me, tighter than any umbilical chord Sonja’s uterus could knit. That little boy lived in the hollow space under my guts, gripping my abdomen with two steely hands and making my chest go tight. Sometimes the other boys, arms airplane-high and tongues wagging would shout,“Hey TardFace! This is what you do in Mrs. Wuertz’s class, don’t you!” And they would plow headlong into tree trunks, each other, anything really.,“Ry Ry, what color helmet do you want for Christmas?” another might taunt.,All I do is try to understand him. I watch him play video games for hours. He is very gifted with them. I try to play, but my hands are all wrong for the controllers with their sensuous plastic curves and exotic buttons. ,Sonja cursed her womb, that first bore an Asperger’s baby, and then, last year, after fondling it tenderly for seven months, bore a very still little girl. She did every amniocentesis test she could to troubleshoot another Ryland. She told me she must be barren. I asked her, what about Ryland. Sonja says that sometimes she looks at him, and wonders if we shouldn’t keep him on a leash.,She was so averse to being alone with Ryland in the car. It was something she avoided, a new excuse every day.,“Ned, can’t you take Ry this morning? I have a millions things to do!” No she didn’t. She couldn’t possibly have a million things to do. Not in one day.  She was always exaggerating and inflating things, blowing hot frantic air into the latex carcasses of already popped balloons, only to find that in order to keep them inflated she would have to continue to blow at them. So she did, until she got tired, and then gave up. I hated waiting for this.,“But we have that meeting this morning about the fund allocations for creative faculty. I really can’t miss that babe.”,“Ned. Not all of us can paint all day long. Some of us have to go to jobs behind desks and sit there. All day. Including the ,.” ,“But I just don’t understand why you have to go in early”,“Because a very important client is coming in, and Mr. Stern needs my support. Ned, just take him. It’s on the way. If you leave now, you’ll only be ten minutes late for your coffee talk thing.”,“Alright,” I said, giving Ryland a smile. “Fuck you,” I said swiftly and quietly to Sonja as the screen door swept shut behind me. ,Sonja was looking at the stony granite of the small kitchen counter, losing her eyes in the mineral whorls, when I stormed back in to snatch the cartoon lunchbox off the counter. It was too light. Looking at Sonja, I threw the plastic box down in front of her, and we both watched it sprawl open to reveal a hollow belly.,“Good mother, Sonja. Really good.”,Recently, Sonja conscientiously objected to being married to me. I didn’t completely see it coming, but I hated her anyway. That doesn’t mean I like having no wife though. And it doesn’t mean I like sharing Ryland with her. The bitterness that accompanies endings is always astounding. That’s why maybe endings should be agreed upon at the beginning, so that really, an ending is just another version of the beginning. Beginnings are always wonderful, infused with majesty and expectation, like a seductive blank canvas.,A rattle at the door announced Celine. ,Celine came into my office, sitting her round hips in my chair, one of those chairs equipped with a trio of rolling wheels, and starting fidgeting in it.,“Celine – your drawing” I said, looking at the empty stool in the room below and the emptier easel.  ,She twirled in the chair, a windspout of careless mirth, eyes amethystine and wild. This, the other students in the other room, the window – all of it made me uncomfortable. A picture frame tumbled off my desk.,“Watch It!” I said more gruffly than I had intended, using both hands to catch the arms of the chair, facing my scruffy brows into her blues. My pectoral muscles convulsed, palpitated, as I leaned over the chair, palms gripping the arms. Her knees knocked into my thighs, and she sort of cowered in the chair beneath the cage of my arms and body. ,Inside, Celine felt she was in a cathedral with vaulted ceilings made of man. And she felt a slight shiver play about her wrists and tickle her nose, felt her lips swell around the edge, and her rib cage twitched slightly as she recovered from the sudden stop of her vigorous game. I knew what was to come, and sure we both conscientiously objected, but physically – how could we? ,Looking directly at me, one eyebrow arched, and in a low level voice, she said,“Warm up number one. Five minutes.”,Excitement wriggled through her, a frisson of energy like the trembling of sunlight at the bottom of a fiercely turquoise swimming pool.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/fleshed_out/,"

"Paris: city of romance, city of wine, cheese and…belligerent drunks? Gropers on the subway? Public urination? Though it is called the City of Lights, Paris, as I have come to know it, actually has a dark and seedy underbelly. ,Having decided to study here for the semester, I am starting to wonder what I have gotten myself into. I have been here before—as a tourist with money and a never-ending list of museums to visit—but this time the city is for real. As an inhabitant of Paris, I have discovered that life consists of far more than the Eiffel Tower and public displays of affection. Budgeting in one of the most expensive cities in the world is a harsh reality. I’m even beginning to hate the English-speaking tourists, if only because they make my morning metro ride (already forty minutes) longer by jamming the doors. Yet despite the fact that I am no longer one of the American tourists, I am still the victim of anti-American sentiment. Or perhaps it is more appropriate to say that I am the victim of sentiments in general: Parisians have a lot of them. The question is how to deal? Become baguette-wielding poodle walker in an attempt to fully integrate? Curl up in a ball and hide? Never the passive type, I haven to write and tell the world of my lamentations, misadventures, frightening intrigues, and ire-rendering twists,Despite my initial misgivings, I am starting to enjoy the fact that everyone here has an opinion. Take Claudine, my host mother, for example. A sixty-something chain smoker, she is a former communist-turned-socialist with an anorexic cat. She spent her childhood in Algeria and, like her cat, has lived countless lives since. Above all else she is a practical idealist. If she could, she would spend all day raging about the evils of genetically modified organisms, and she can tell you a hundred things wrong with socialism; however, in the end she will settle for whatever she thinks will help those who most need it. ,Her daughter Nelly, in her late twenties, is still fighting for perfection. A self-described “typical Parisian youth,” she has thrown herself wholeheartedly into the debate surrounding the upcoming election. She has promised me that if Ségolène Royal, the female candidate for the Socialist party, is not elected president, she will move to Berlin. Sound familiar, Bush haters? I wouldn’t put it past Nelly, though. She practices for her future expatriate existence when she comes over for lunch by making me dance to German pop music with her. Needless to say, conversation with these two is always lively, and when you find that a language barrier makes it difficult to express an opinion, it’s nice to have plenty to listen to in the house. ,What is not so pleasant is the daily harassment from complete strangers. It seems that many, especially the mentally unstable, are scared of the so-called “American” tactics of Nicolas Sarkozy, the forerunner for the political right. While they clearly love Ségolène (she is affectionately referred to by her first name), their hatred for Sarkozy, and for me, is becoming a little overwhelming. Speaking English in the street, even if discussing such harmless topics as the newly shaved head of Britney Spears (which I was, I am ashamed to say), has caused comments such as “vive la Gauche, cretin” thrown at me. Granted, this man was unwell—he continued by telling me to insert something somewhere I didn’t catch, and then, I think, said something about my dog—but I am at no loss for examples.,Take for instance the man I encountered while getting off the bus my second week here: he walked out from behind the waiting area and heard me conversing unobtrusively with my friend in English. He proceeded to tell me (and believe me, it sounds even more insulting in French) that I was “going to burn in hell” and that I was a “dirty slut.” He was also crazy. And drunk. But that only made him willing to express what many only think. ,Claudine thinks that these stories are hilarious and harmless, and to a certain extent she is right. None of the politically active name-callers have ever been physically aggressive. Much worse then the anti-American xenophobes are the Parisians with problems devoid of a patriotic hue. These lovely citizens are usually public drunks, such as the one I saw last week while waiting on a corner, a practice which in retrospect is not a good idea. I heard a noise that, if it can be spelled, would look something like “Graaaaphagapha-grahumbabadump” and looked up to see a man stumbling towards the curb on the other side of the road. He was facing me, but didn’t seem to care that I was there—an insight confirmed when he unzipped his pants and peed for a solid ninety seconds onto the street. After a leisurely finish he stumbled a few steps and collapsed face down on the ground. All I could think was “Oh, God. He’s dead. I just saw a man die while peeing.” Luckily, a Good Samaritan called an ambulance for him, and he was conscious and grumbling by the time it arrived. ,That, while unnerving, is still not as bad as the Metro. Paris is a safe city in general, as long as you keep your wallet close, but to be a girl alone on the Metro is a daily exercise in evasion tactics. There is a new breed of “dragueur,” or semi-professional pick-up artist, usually in his late teens to mid twenties. The typical dragueur operates something like this: Step one—pretend to think the girl is French and ask for the time. The less practiced ones will ask for a tissue, until they realize that runny noses are not usually a turn-on. Step two—act delighted when they realize she is foreign! Proceed to speak to the girl in broken English until she can’t help but laugh. Step three—take her laughing as a declaration of interest and ask her out for a drink, for her number, or propose an intimate vacation for the coming weekend. Slick, yes? But this new dragueur sees no need for such formalities. He simply walks through the tunnels with a look on his face that says “Hello. I am a pervert, and I am going to touch you now.” And touch you he will, unless you are nimble and perceptive. ,As I have learned, dear friends, it’s better to be yelled at by a man with an agenda than groped during rush hour. But if nothing else, I am coming to terms with how things work here, and in a city where everyone is an expert, and even the taxi drivers can deliver polished speeches on healthcare fraud and how it is dragging down the entire country, at the very least, it is nice to understand.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/this_just_in_from_paris/,"

"Thomas awoke with aching teeth.  The television was on and muted and flashed through the dark room.  Thomas’ bent knees obstructed his view of the box itself.  He opened his mouth and rotated his lower jaw back and forth, spellbound by the click it made with each oscillation.  He had kicked off the comforter at some point in the night.  “This isn’t fair,” he muttered as he shuffled to the bathroom.  He shut off the television, opened the door to the hall, silent.  He hung his Do Not Disturb sign and went back to sleep.  He awoke again, however, before daybreak, and was unable to go back to sleep.  Thomas was, and is, on a well deserved vacation.,Despite his predilection for room service, Thomas ventured to the breakfast buffet on the one-hundred-forty-second morning of his stay at the Mirage Resort and Spa.  He showered with the curtain drawn.  He dressed with the faithful precision that only a vacationing businessman can observe: facing the mirror, he slid thick fingers through shirtsleeves, buttons through holes, belt through buckle.  The comb ran through his wet hair like floss in the pockets between gums and teeth.  “Ready when you are,” he said.  He packed sandals and suntan lotion for the beach.  At breakfast, Thomas sat alone.  He faced the entrance as if expecting company.  The buffet did him justice and he was pleased. ,Thomas was walking down the wooden steps to the beach when he took a fall.  His arms splayed like the wings of a graceless angel and he belly-flopped into the sand.  He rolled onto his back, squinted into the sun, and gave the sky the finger.  An old couple hurried over to assist him.,“Are you alright?” the woman asked.  ,“I’m fine,” Thomas said.  ,“You took quite the fall,” the man said.  ,“I’m fine.  I just tripped.”,The man helped Thomas to his feet with considerable effort.  Upon impact, Thomas’ sunscreen had burst in his pocket and only now was he aware of the consequences.  His shorts were soaked with lotion and the woman was debating whether to comment.  ,“Thank you for your help.  I need to head back and change,” he preempted.,“We’re headed back that way anyhow,” the man said.,The woman’s head shook with injustice.  ,“Those stairs are a disaster waiting to happen.  Let’s speak with the concierge.”,“Yes,” the man added.,“I appreciate it.  But I don’t think that will be necessary.”,After the old couple latched on, Thomas rightfully feared for his solitude.  The Levits, as they were called, escorted him back to the hotel and through the lobby, conversing the whole way.  Topics included, but were not limited to, Birthplace (the Levits are from Ohio, which is cold this time of year), Marine Life (the jellyfish that riddle the beach are completely harmless, albeit soggy and unpleasant), and Finance (Thomas works in finance).  Needless to say, a dinner invitation seemed imminent.  It was at this point, however, that Thomas’ head pivoted as if of its own accord to regard the beautiful young woman approaching with deliberate steps.,To put it simply, Thomas had a strong reaction to the sight of this woman.  He inhaled her asthmatically, his teeth grinded together and his tongue wicked away the surplus of saliva that was threatening to discharge from his lips.  The curvature of her breasts made his throat constrict and his neck and hands broke out with a rash.  To put it simply, Thomas had a strong reaction to the sight of this woman.,“Hello Mom,” the woman said.,“Oh hi love.  How was the spa?” Mrs. Levit asked.,“It was great,” she said.  And to Thomas— “Are you all right?”,Thomas clenched his fists and gulped determinedly.  ,“Just allergies,” he croaked.  “Flowers.”,“Fiona, this is Thomas,” said Mrs. Levit, “We met on the beach.”,“Nice to meet you,” she said, extending her hand.  “I’m Fiona.” ,“Hello.”  He clasped her hand with his own itchy fingers. ,He saw her survey the curdling flecks of lotion on and in his shorts.,“Fuck,” he muttered.,“I’m sorry?” Fiona’s eyes narrowed.,“Fiona. Your father and I were about to invite Thomas to join us for dinner.”,“He’s a real character,” her father added.  ,“Okay,” she responded. ,“Can you make it, Thomas?”,He hid his itchy hands in his soaked pockets and gave a piecemeal bow., “Yes, Mrs. Levit, definitely.  I thank you for the invitation.”,Despite the modest first impression he had made on Fiona, Thomas had a good feeling about the meal to come.  He was going out to dinner with a beautiful woman, a dangerously beautiful woman, and her parents were already quite fond of him.  ‘A real character,’ her father had said.  A normal, dignified man.  “Just please let me be myself for one night,” he said.,All in all, bearing in mind Thomas’ propensity for mishap, the dinner ran relatively smoothly.  They sat, in clockwise order, with Thomas facing the entrance, Fiona to his left, and her father and her mother rounding out the lineup.  There was a pleasant ocean breeze.  The first blip for Thomas came when the waiter took the party’s orders.  Fiona’s parents ordered fish and she ordered salad.  He ordered a daiquiri, which, in and of itself, was by no means an irremediable error.   His mistake was compounded by his dinner order, however: he assumed Fiona’s salad was an appetizer, so he ordered the Blackened Mahi Mahi skewers that he was so partial to.  His appetizer arrived alone.,“Apologies,” he said. “I mistook your salad for an appetizer.”,“Oh, don’t worry,” she said.  “It’s all I’m having.  I’m just a very picky eater.”,“Me too,” he blurted.  His growling belly contradicted his words.  ,“So you’re just here, alone, on vacation?” Fiona asked.,Thomas chewed and swallowed.  “That’s the idea.”  He grinned toothlessly.,“How long have you been here?”,Thomas retreated into his pink calculating fingers.  ,“A few months,” he said.,“A few months?”,“So Tom, can I call you Tom, I guess finance is treating you well?” Mr. Levit said.,Thomas hastily swallowed more than he could handle and began coughing.,“Easy there, Tom,” he chuckled.,Thomas’ eyes flashed and his tongue heaved concentrically.  ,“I was just teasing,” he said.  ,“He’s choking!” screamed Fiona’s mother.  ,The waiter rushed over and guests began to turn their heads.,With what amounted to a hiccup, Thomas coughed up the ball of food onto his lap.  He trapped the unruly meat in a napkin and caught his breath.,The dinner guests let out a light clap.  ,“It just went down the wrong way,” he said.  “Apologies.”,The waiter kindly returned his empty plate to the kitchen from whence it came.,A brief digression is in order at this juncture.  When Thomas was four years old, he went with his father to work one day.  In the midst of a crowded elevator, he held on to his father’s suit jacket to avoid becoming separated and lost.  When the elevator emptied, he discovered that he was clinging to the jacket of a redheaded man who he had never seen before.  “You’re not my dad!” Thomas shrieked in horror.  The man laughed, and his father laughed, and over the years, as he remembered it, everyone else in the elevator laughed too.,The main course arrived.  The waiter watched Thomas with the knowing eyes of a babysitter who has identified the family miscreant.  Thomas had another drink.  The whole restaurant was watchful, anticipating.  Perhaps it was the alcohol, his nerves, Fiona’s splendor, or something more sinister, but Thomas began to speak with very little reserve.  He spoke intimately about Health (his poor sleeping schedule was really catching up to him), Odyssey (it’s just impossible to find a good shady spot on the beach), and even the Meaning of Life (his masturbatory habits).   Mr. and Mrs. Levit seemed to take the comments in good taste, and Mr. Levit responded quite amicably.  He said:  “There’s a word for people like you. What’s the word for people like you?”  Thomas seemed to be listening to himself speak just as the Levits were.  When Thomas alluded to Mr. and Mrs. Levit’s sex-life (Do you have an adjoining room? You must keep Fiona up all night long) — or something to that effect— he had crossed some line of propriety that was imperceptible to his free-flapping tongue.  “Please don’t talk about my family that way,” Mr. Levit responded.  The prickly moment ,soon passed, however, and conversation turned to Fiona’s professional career.,“…Yes, it’s really taking up all of my time,” she said.,“But you’re enjoying it?” her father asked.  “That’s the important thing…”,“Oh, definitely, it’s just — that—“,“Excuse me, what is it you do for a living?” Thomas asked.,“I’m a painter,” Fiona said.  ,“Oh! Wonderful,” said Thomas.,“I was just talking about the painting I’ve been working on.”,“Tell him what you’re calling it!” said Mrs. Levit.  ,“I was thinking of naming it Pulchritude,” she said.,“Mmm hmm,” Thomas said.,“I just feel like Pulchritude is the ugliest beautiful word,” she said.,“Yes,” Thomas said.,“The ugliest word that means beautiful, I mean.  I think it creates a nice tension.”     ,“So what are you trying to achieve?” Thomas asked.  “Just something beautiful?”,“Well, that’s hard to say,” Fiona said.,“Yes.”,“I guess mostly I just want to create something that will outlive me.”,“Mmm hmm.  But isn’t that what children are for?”  Thomas winked.,Thomas’ witticism, if you could call it that, was not appreciated.,“Your advances make me uncomfortable and you have to stop,” Fiona said. ,After the ill-advised wink, Thomas’ eye was still crammed shut like a rubber-banded lobster claw.  No matter how hard he tried and pried, his eye simply would not open.  “This is going too far,” he said, gritting his teeth.  He considered wedging it open with spoons, but stopped short for propriety’s sake.  “Fuck you,” he said.  As you can imagine, Thomas’ closed eye was impairing his ability to maintain even a semblance of normal human interaction: not only was it more difficult for the Levit family to converse with the winking, muttering man, but Thomas’ depth perception was hazardously forfeited.  It was only a matter of minutes before he sent his fourth daiquiri careening to the floor.  At this point, the waiter was standing at attention at such close proximity that he almost managed to catch the falling glass out of the air.  Or at least it seemed so to Thomas, though his poor eyesight made this an educated guess at best.  ,“Sorry about that,” Thomas said.,“It’s not a problem,” said the waiter.  “Shall I bring you another daiquiri?”,Thomas’ head nodded up and down. ,“Right away, absolutely,” said the waiter.  “Aye aye, captain.” ,“I hate you,” Thomas mumbled.  ,Dessert was most fulfilling in every sense of the word.  Much to Fiona’s dismay— she was eyeing the rash that was venturing up Thomas’ arms— the Levits had opted to share a lemon meringue amongst the table.  ,“Dig in,” Mr. Levit said.  ,Fork in hand, Thomas eyed the meringue with a sideways glance and watched as the Levits began to eat.  Like a sniper, Thomas aligned his squinting eye with his arm with the dessert plate, and prepared to pull the trigger.  Whether it was his lack of depth perception, or the shapely, dome-like structure of the meringue itself, or something more sinister, Thomas missed the plate entirely.  His fork poked Fiona in her right breast with considerable force.  She let out a warbling shriek and kicked over Thomas’ chair.  He fell to the ground for the second time that day, taking his fifth daiquiri down with him.,“What in the name of God!” cried Mr. Levit.,“Ahhhhhhh,” said Mrs. Levit.  ,“You fucking pervert!” screamed Fiona.  “What was that for?”,“Why would you do this to me?” cried Thomas.,“What?”	,“Why do you always do this to me?” cried Thomas.,“He’s out of his mind.”  ,“Chicken breast,” said Thomas.  ,Fiona kicked Thomas in the side of the head and stormed out of the restaurant.,Thomas lay, one-eyed, hangdog, red in the face and arms.  “Why?” he said.,“You should be ashamed of yourself,” Mrs. Levit said.  ,“You’re footing the bill,” said Mr. Levit.  “And foot this too.”,Mr. Levit gave him a kick in the ribs and the couple bounded out of the restaurant, arm in arm.  Mrs. Levit whispered to her husband regarding his bravery.  Thomas was acutely aware that they would have sex, adjoining room or not, later that evening.  Thomas scrambled to his feet and, as if trying to fall off the face of the earth, hurled himself headlong into a table.  ,“Why would you do this to me?” he screamed.  “Let me out of here!”    ,“Let me out of here!”,Hotel guests were circling the cyclopean monstrosity.,“Ahhhhhh!” he said.,The waiter approached and Thomas seized him by the lapels of his jacket.,Thomas fell to his knees and his screams slowly transfigured into words.,“Why would he do this to me?” he demanded.  ,His teeth clapped like hooves. ,“It’s just so… mean.”,He itched his sealed eye with his hive-covered hand.,“You have to help me!”,The waiter calmly uncurled Thomas’ fingers from his jacket.  “Get off me,” the waiter said.  “I’m not your father.”  He let out a low, lurching laugh that rattled his whole body, and one by one, the hotel guests, the staff, an infant, the cook, a golden retriever, began to laugh, applaud, squeal, cheer, drool.  To put it bluntly and save you the trouble, Thomas was crestfallen.  “I,” Thomas said, “have had enough of this.”  He whirled his arm across a nearby table, sweeping plates, cups, bowls, dishes, to the floor, iconoclastic, frenzied.  ,Immaterial.   “I’ve had enough of this!” he said.,Bolting out of the restaurant, Thomas returned to his room howling.,“Fuck you!” he said. ,He punted the television off of its stand.  ,“Fuck you, you don’t control me,” he said.  ,Thomas ripped a leg of the bed from its frame and brandished it.  ,“You don’t control me!”,Thomas removed his shirt, revealing his gelatinous, blubbering bulk.  ,“I hate you,” he said.  “I’m not fat!”  ,There was a knock at the door.,“Ohhhhhh,” he wailed.  “What now!”,It was the concierge, who opened the door with a key.  “You are fat,” he said.,“I’m not fat!”  ,“I will procure the necessary documents.” The concierge pivoted and left. ,Thomas’s grinding teeth crashed together, bits flaking off like pencil shavings, cheese gratings, confetti.  ,Thomas dipped the wooden leg of the bed into a bucket of ink that was sitting on his dresser.  He began to scrawl across the wallpaper, mirrors, doorframes, like a toddler.  ,Michael Sard Was Here, he wrote.  ,He sprinted down the hall of the hotel writing, shirtless and screaming, as he went.,Michael Sard Was Here,Michael Sard Was Here,M S ,M S ,M S,M S,“I hate you,” Thomas said.,“I hate you,” Thomas said.,I Love You, Thomas wrote.,“I love you,” Thomas said.  “You granted me life.”  ,Thomas continued running down the halls toward the lobby.,“Not only have you granted me life,” said Thomas, “but you are an engaging and entertaining writer who has put me in the wittiest of situations that I am truly blessed to have partaken in.  I would apologize for boring you with this explanation, but…”  ,Thomas grinned.,“Who am I even talking to?”,Thomas was standing beside the concierge desk.  He rang the bell for assistance.,“Yes, I have the evidence right here,” the concierge said.  “I quote: ‘The man helped Thomas to his feet with considerable effort.’”,“It’s because he was old!” Thomas said.,“It’s because you are fat!  And besides, here is some irrefutable evidence: ‘He dressed with the faithful precision that only a vacationing businessman can observe: facing the mirror, he slid thick fingers through shirtsleeves, buttons through—“,“He changed it! My fingers weren’t thick this morning! I promise.”,“Can you kindly corroborate my statement?” the concierge asked you.,“Thank you kindly,” he said.  “Now are you satisfied?”,Thomas hunched and guffawed.  “Sard, you rapscallion, you are one shrewd bastard,” Thomas said.  His head ,shook horizontally and his cheeks jiggled.  “Too shrewd.”,“How long am I checked in here for?” Thomas asked.,“We can comfortably accommodate you for as long as you like, sir.”,Rash-faced, toothless, one-eyed, fat and covered in ink, Thomas smiled. ,“I would like to stay forever,” he beamed.,He was quite the character.,And you, Fearless Reader, you original thing, will turn the page.

"The Prince wants to know what happened at pickups. This year set a precedent for all manner of illegal and debauched activities and at the forefront of this tidal wave of sexual assault, underage drinking and bodily fluids, stood the Tiger Inn. Or so says the Prince. Not that this is anything unusual or new, the Prince has consistently singled out the Tiger Inn as an unruly place conducive to such problems.,I ask the Prince: why does it matter that “details remain unclear?” The Prince continues to demand the details of the sexual assault to come out, but why is that important? Why this perverse fascination with how the event unfolded? It does not benefit anyone but further stigmatizes the victim and ostracizes the perpetrator, who has not had charges brought against him.,Earlier in the year a Charter member sexually assaulted a TI member in an upstairs room. This failed to generate any gross generalizations about Charter as a whole, but somehow marked Tiger Inn as a place where this was condoned. Unfortunately an incident occurred on the night of pickups, further fueling this unfair misperception. On that night, Tiger Inn members, sought out by the alleged assailant, helped the victim, bringing her to McCosh, and dealt with Public Safety and the Borough Police instead of ducking the issue, as I’d hope anyone would do. Afterwards the victim chose not to press charges.,The problem with sexual assault at Princeton is not a new one, but recent events have justifiably brought it to the attentions of students and the University. To hold the Tiger Inn as an institution responsible for the entire University-wide problem distracts from the real issue of sexual assault on campus inside and out of all eating clubs. Instead of addressing its own deficiencies in monitoring and controlling the problem, the University has decided to pin the issue on a handful of degenerates at the Tiger Inn. ,Daniel Silverman claimed in an April 5th Prince article: “I’m delighted that more people are being hospitalized with us… because they’re in a safe setting.” Such blithe optimism masks the issue. It’s like the warden of a prison saying “I’m delighted that more people are here with us… because they’re in a safe setting,” without acknowledging the greater problem. Similarly, Dr. Silverman doesn’t seem willing to acknowledge the problems outside of the walls of McCosh. Worse yet, he doesn’t seem willing to accept some measure of personal failure in preventing sexual assault on campus.,Unlike other campus organizations, there has been recourse within the Tiger Inn. Sexual assault has been discussed at club meetings, and the club is implementing new policy to prevent sexual assault in the future (a security council to patrol the club and escort drunken members and guests home and locking all upstairs rooms). Members of the Tiger Inn have addressed their own role in campus sexual assault, come up with solutions in house and done both without pointing a finger elsewhere.,The Tiger Inn has been off-tap for 7 weeks now as we have negotiated a new member constitution, to protect ourselves and hold ourselves accountable. During that time, however, matters seem to have worsened, largely as a result of rumor and hearsay, seemingly perpetuated by the Prince. In an April 6th Prince article, Daniel Silverman described students being hospitalized for gastroenteritis during pickups and initiations drinking their own vomit and students being locked into rooms and force fed alcohol. He did not mention any club by name.,Three days later, I ran into Matt Margolin, class of ’05 and a young alumni trustee. “What’s happening at your club?” he asked. ,Pickups and initiations at Tiger Inn are a lot less interesting than people want to think. People drink beer. No one is forced to. We have respect for our membership, even sophomores. As for the gastroenteritis, the last time I checked, chugging vodka and vomit shooters (thought I’m storing that delectable tidbit away for the next chance I have to haze some poor underclassman) wasn’t the only way to contract it. Maybe cramming 150 people in a room together for 48 hours at the height of flu season or serving one bad batch of hot dogs would do it. What seems more likely Dr. Silverman?,I’m actually shocked that freshman Prince writers would help perpetuate this second-hand journalistic dreck. I thought freshman were supposed to like TI. We like you. Or rather, we liked you. Apparently freshman who write for the Prince don’t hang out at TI enough to care whether it goes off tap indefinitely or if it gets an undeservedly bad reputation. They sure don’t hang out at TI enough to catch gossip first hand. If they had, maybe they’d have heard how half the club got sidelined with the flu the week after pickups.,The solution? Make up your own stories. Instead of the libel suit you would get in the real world, you get the illusion of journalistic integrity and social justice warming your cockles. ,I’m surprised, however, that the Prince couldn’t manage something more compelling. If you’re going to write a story in fantasyland, why stop at making new members chug their own vomit? Why not throw in an Aristocratic flourish or two: midget nazi’s with flamethrowers searing the secret club logo (A tiger’s face formed from the letters “R-A-P-E”) into the nubile bodies of our new membership?,I would love demonstrate that kind of bold-faced, gratuitous fiction, to look at your facebook profiles and shit all over the pathetic semblance of the social lives I imagine you all lead. I would love to take the same liberties that the Prince does and to recklessly perpetuate rumors about you all under the guise of outing the truth. Most of what I espoused probably wouldn’t be far from the truth anyhow. But at the Tiger Inn we treat people respectfully, even if they haven’t done anything to deserve it.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/assault__silverman3/,"

"I. Béla Fleck & the Flecktones: The Hidden Land,	So to start, this is the one album that isn’t much marked by the times. These guys have been doing their thing for so long that it’s almost unnecessary to talk about; either you’ve heard of them and like them, or you haven’t and don’t. So I have no idea what induced them to entitle their album so, although it does a fair job of capturing the ethereal character of much of their music,	The Flecktones are a quartet of phenomenal musicians: banjo virtuoso & band leader Béla Fleck, bassist Victor Wooten, drummer-of-sorts Future-Man, and Jeff Conklin on reeds & flute, whose music is an inimitable melange of bluegrass, jazz, fusion, and classical music. It’s music that’s hard to explain, harder to justify, and either really cool or mindless noodling.,	Béla’s side-project of the past few years – recordings of classical music (the highly recommend Perpetual Motion and his Edgar Meyer duet Music for Two) – is featured on the opener, a rendering of a Bach fugue which is exemplary Flecktones. Opening with Future-Man’s Synth-Axe Drumitar, the recording is a perfectly serious take that’s as germane an album opener as could be imagined for something that spans the gamut from the Middle East-infused “Chennai” to the laid-back honky-tonk “Couch Potato.”,	The album is uniformly well-produced, dynamic, and listenable, which is much more than could be said for much of the Flecktones’ last album.  However, it’s not really until “Weed Whacker,” lying at the very middle of the album, that the band really hits its stride. Moving from extended solos that give each member time to stretch out and explore the song’s chord to intense, densely-layered ensemble playing, driven especially by Béla’s furious finger-picking, the band effectively moves from a blistering up-tempo opening, to a moody interlude with a spectacular soprano sax solo by Conklin, to a funky, phasered recapitulation of the opening half. The Flecktones are at their best in the fluidity of the segues from straight-ahead jazz to bluegrass to Hendrix, but without the blending that can occasionally neuter the excitement.,II. Umphrey’s McGee: Safety in Numbers,	Umphrey’s McGee is the best jam band around. Based out of Chicago for the past few years, they’ve been circulating the festival scene and touring for almost a decade, with their present line-up in place since Kris Myers replaced Mike Mirro on drums in 2003. They’re obsessive over their live shows, studying each one extensively and relying upon a complicated set of hand motions by which to improvise songs on the fly.,	And yet for all that, their third album, Safety in Numbers, is remarkably detached from their exuberant live act. Only one cut breaks the 7-minute mark, and just barely, only one of the songs is an instrumental, and most of the guitar/keyboard pyrotechnics that blow you away live are generally subsumed into the songs. The songs themselves are fantastic – if unlikely to become concert staples – strangely straddling a line between menace, moodiness, and fist-pumping rock.,	They open with “Believe the Lie,” a straight-ahead rocker with some throwaway lyrics that I suppose are about a break-up. Or maybe just a fight. Either way, the propulsive rhythm and percolating guitars give the song an edgy nervousness that would overshadow whatever the point of the lyrics was, anyways.,	The third track, “Liquid,” is a short and wonderfully evocative song which effectively uses echo filters, muddy guitars, and rolling percussion, and a wistful accordion to live up to its name. Equally impressive is the song’s ending, a cacophonous freak-out with foreboding, incoherent rambling – the accordion swirling in and out of tune, until the next song, “Words,” launches out of the mess. The only track on the album that overstays it’s welcome, with a long, meditative interlude starting after five minutes that ends with a recap of the original melody that could have been excised without loss.,	Following the melodic “Nemo,” which is marked by Joel Cummins’ excellent keyboard work, is the standout track of the album “Women Wine and Song.” A bluesy romp with harp and vocals courtesy of Huey Lewis, it’s the only track to escape the general sense of foreboding which colors the rest of the album in favor a great hooray-for-the-good-life sing-a-long chorus that’s ready-made for live performance – although Lewis’ blowing makes the studio track an interesting variation from live versions.,	This segues into the light acoustic number “End of the Road,” which almost feels like it ought to be the end of the album, both for the title and for its light touch. They don’t disappoint with the final three songs. Starting with “Passing,” which reins in the morose and instead, in what my brother calls their 90s alt-metal song – features soaring vocals, screaming guitars, and a feeling that even if, as the band says “there’s safety in numbers/ but I’m not impressed,” it’s hard to be not impressed by the sheer amount of talent they possess.,	The penultimate cut, “Ocean Billy,” in its run-of-the-mill rambling, takes a swipe at their own success, “Would it matter if no one looked/ Half of the time on a stage/ Where most of its not even real,” and slowly builds momentum until the pounding coda, which catches Umphrey’s in a rare moment of harmonic monotony, sticking to one chord for over a minute while the rest of the band cuts loose, crashing into the finale, “The Weight Around,” with pun intended. It’s a nice conclusion to the album, resolving the more neurotic parts with a reserved lament, “I hope you’re worth the wait around/ If I’m not I understand.”,	What makes the album work so well, particularly for fans of the band, is that it consciously plays with the band’s successful live act, using concise songwriting and studio production to give the album an emotional arc which undercuts the tracks on which they stretch out, adding a logic to the growth of the songs that otherwise becomes monotonous on record. It’s not really a good way to be introduced to the band- you have to see them live- but the album works on its own terms brilliantly.,III. The Flaming Lips: At War with the Mystics,	There’s nothing here to live up to the beauty of “Do You Realize??” or the songcraft of The Soft Bulletin, instead, the Flaming Lips are dancing – and the tracks are as compulsively danceable as ever – yet in more openly dark territory. From the provocative opener’s “If you could make everybody poor just so you could be rich/ Would you do it?” to the anger of “Haven’t Got a Clue,” “Every time you state your case/ The more I want to punch your face,” there’s nothing like the optimistic reservation expressed earlier, it’s been supplanted by the gloomy question, “How do we keep going on?”,	But for all that, it’s the Flaming Lips – it’s fun. “The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song” features, of course, background vocals singing “Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,” and if you don’t pay any attention to the verses, sounds like an uplifting bit of power pop, with the driving chorus “With all your power/ What would you do?” And the music video, which is on their website, is either hilarious or totally deranged- I suppose it depends on how offended you are by exploiting obesity or the obvious implications about American society.,	Then there’s “Free Radicals,” or “A Hallucination of the Christmas Skeleton Pleading with a Suicide Bomber.” The subtitles on this album are as sweet as ever. “You think you’re so radical/ But you’re not so radical/ In fact you’re just Fanatical!!” I guess it’s a political statement. I think it’s just a pretty sweet rhyme. And the guitar lick at the end of each verse is a funky, crunchy riff that makes the whole thing impossible to take too seriously. And a damn cool song.,	The next few tracks start to meander more, slowing the tempo down. But the songwriting is quite strong enough to carry it off. There are brilliant moments, when in “My Cosmic Autumn Rebellion” the lines “They see the sun go down but they don’t see it rise,” are followed by a caesura marked by descending guitar chords and strings, only to launch back into the triumphant last verse – “Yes it’s true someday everything dies/ We won’t let that defeat us.”,	The instrumental “The Wizard Turns On…” marks the midpoint of the album, nicely breaking up the languor of the previous tracks with it’s funky, fuzz-boxed guitar, hesitant flute, and screeching keyboards descending into a low drone, which breaks with the infectious romp “It Overtakes Me.” This cut spends too much time moving through a quiet, atmospheric bridge, before breaking into a serene finger-picked guitar finale that would have served well enough on its own to defuse the jumpiness of the first half of the song.,	“Mr. Ambulance Driver,” with it’s eerie usage of a siren, relatively sparse production, and clear lyrics, perfectly augments the doleful lyrics – “Mr. Ambulance Driver I’m not a real survivor/ ‘Cause I’m wishing that I wasn’t the one that/ Wasn’t gonna be here any more.” “Haven’t Got A Clue,” fills up more sonic space with drones and bleeps, building up the sound as the lyrics become more aggressive, from “You used your money and your friends/ To try and trick me… But you won’t trick me,” to “Every time you state your case/ The more I want to punch your face.” The close interplay of lyrics and music, and the fact that the chorus is unbelievably infectious in spite of it’s anger, makes this my favorite track.,	The next track is “Pompeii am Götterdämmerung,” and with it’s Pink Floyd-esque bass-line it is naturally apocalyptic, if happily so – “Now we’ll be forever holding hands/ Lava and tephra will for our bed/ Now the royal flames of Pompeii bless/ All our senses…” But then, the finale, “Goin’ on,” says “We hold our breath ’til the morning comes/ And at last the sun shines through,” so who knows. What’s nice about the best parts of this album is the tight interconnection of lyric and music, and – even when it gets droll – the melodicism of the Flaming Lips. It doesn’t quite do justice to its potential, but it’s got enough to justify itself.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/three_reviews/,"

"Remember the song “Maps” and the video with lead singer Karen O crying with such sincerely that a thousand emo-boys fell in love overnight?  The song was so good that it got the Yeah Yeah Yeahs a national TV gig on the Blockbuster Awards.  And then there was a lot of waiting, for a second album that never came.  Well now, finally, the band is back with a vengeance, sort of, with a follow-up several years in the making.  To say this album is highly anticipated would be channeling 2004.  The band’s extended lay-off has made this release, which by all accounts should have been a pretty big deal considering the hype the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were given just a few years ago, into just another spring indie release, wedged between the new Ghostface Killah and Flaming Lips.,To regenerate some of that buzz, Show Your Bones would have to be a seminal, life-changing insta-classic.  Unfortunately, it’s not.  Much like Interpol, a similarly hyped New York band, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs second album is a dose of reality to those few who still believe that lead singer Karen O can change the world.  There are moments that make you understand why everybody thought they had so much promise, but there are also moments that make you realize that they are not quite the second coming of the Pixies.,The first single, “Gold Lion” is one of the latter moments.  The song marches along with drummer Brian Chase channeling Dave Grohl and Karen O at her shrieking, scatting best, overwhelming the song with the force of her personality.  When she screams “Outside, Inside / This is a moon without a tide” with such purpose, you can’t help but feel inspired.  It’s only after the song has finished that you realize you aren’t really inspired to do anything because the lyrics don’t make sense.  This is one of the most beautiful things about the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.  Karen O’s lyrics rarely, if ever, tell a coherent story.  But like Julian Casablancas of the Strokes, the phrases and one-liners she tosses off haphazardly are oddly captivating, like “My those quiet eyes become you” from “Turn Into” or “Hot cold season gonna sink in my sweat” from “Dudley”.,The following track, “Way Out” is another bright spot.  Karen O repeats “fits around me” over and over again with enough attitude to make Chrissie Hynde jealous.  Karen O has the ability, with her powerful personality, to make her slightly nonsensical lyrics sound so good when spoken.  She makes good use of it here.,But at the same time, songs such as “Fancy” and “Honeybear” plod along and ultimately go nowhere.  “Fancy” has the same military drumming of “Gold Lion” without an interesting melody.  “Honey Bear” starts off promisingly with the cutting line “Turn yourself around, you weren’t invited”, but the brief spark of potential doesn’t last.  It’s half a song and ends with a lot of nothing.  “The Sweets” and “Warrior” and “Turn Into” all begin with a strumming acoustic guitar and slowly build to a wall of sound climax.  It would have been wonderful if they hadn’t repeated the same trick in three consecutive songs.,The album’s centerpieces are the sixth and seventh tracks, “Cheated Heart” and “Dudley.”  It is the highpoint of the Show Your Bones aesthetic of clean, catchy rock tunes that come very close to being over-produced, but don’t quite cross the line.  Stylistically, both resemble “Y Control” from their debut album Fever to Tell.  Karen O’s voice glides along, Chase’s drumming propels the song forward, and Zinner keeps himself low-key to mesh with Karen O’s subdued singing.  They are two of the more entertaining and catchy rock songs of the year.,But Show Your Bones’ main problem lies with what’s not here, instead of what is.  There is no show-stopping, jaw-dropping classic like “Maps,” the song that single-handedly saved their major label career.  There is a distinct lack of the raw energy that highlighted some of their early works such as “Our Time” and much of the sexual energy that populated the first half of Fever to Tell is missing as well.  As much as Karen O’s screaming can get old after a while, it was one of the reasons her band seemed so fresh and dangerous in the first place.  ,There’s a good chance you won’t remember this album 20 years from now.  Show Your Bones proves what we all sort of thought 3 years ago when the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were on the cover of every music magazine and Karen O was the coolest thing since sliced bread:  they are a good, not exceedingly special band that occasionally hints at greatness.  Karen O isn’t John Lennon and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs aren’t the Beatles.  But they are a very good band that makes entertaining, exciting, and every once in a while, transcendent music.  That’s something to be proud about.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/yeah/,"

"On the seventieth anniversary of Ataturk’s death I was in the mountains between Van and Diyarbakir with a baby on my lap and her three year old brother stretched out on the seat behind me while their mother tried to sleep, the silk scarf slipping from her hair. Soldiers stopped our bus in a valley.  Guns slung over their shoulders, they searched our bags and each sack of vegetables. Bombs had been found the night before in Hakkari, set to go off during the ceremonies for Ataturk’s anniversary, so any vehicle bound for towns with ceremonies in the South East was suspect. The mountains rose and fell around us.  Bands of goats and sheep and shepherds, women with bright scarves and baggy shalvars at work in the narrow fields that traced the palms of deep valleys, brought the slopes to life. Iraq lay beyond the rockiest, highest mountains.  Snow was already thick upon the peaks. Driving out of Van, we passed the road to Iran.  The cold bit into me after two months on the Mediterranean.  Even so, I was sorry to travel south west, away from Van and the border lands, on the lake that never freezes over. The boatman laughed when I asked if it ever did. It’s a salt water lake, he told me, as his boat carried us to an island and the gold brown walls of Aktamar, an Armenian church built a thousand years ago, with images of animals carved deep and clear into its sides.  In Van, the new town pushes against the low brown hills. Sheer mountains loom above. Smoky streets were lit up like Christmas, their paving worn and obscured by dust. Stretching across a high rocky outcrop, the thick walls and towers of a castle dominate the horizon and seem to guard the ruins of the early town razed by the fighting with the Russians and Armenians.  A desolate, marshy plain stretches to the lake, undulating with the dim outlines of buildings grown over, covered by reeds and wet, uncertain earth. The buildings that remain are among the oldest, a couple of minarets and the ruins of a church. Men wandered along the firmer paths. Far below, a woman burned something in a pale haze. Through the last gold November leaves I could see the lake, but I’d been told I shouldn’t go there alone, so I did not climb down to watch for the rare birds said to nest by the lakeshore.  Instead I stood, watching the people pick out what they could among the ruins.  ,***,We came to Diyarbakir in darkness. Every day there was less sunlight so I woke early. The guidebook described the walls in one passage and left the slum neighborhoods to another. I followed the walls along the base, focusing on the dark gateways, the rooftops, until the walls had tumbled entirely away.  I had walked into the empty quarter of my map; twisting roads, low houses, hordes of children not in school and women peeling vegetables on doorsteps. Vaguely lost, I took a picture of the pink and blue houses, the rubbish pushing against the thick black basalt ruins of the Seljuk walls that rose from Roman foundations beneath. One civilization scraping out a living in the ruins of another, my mother wrote when she saw my pictures. Children surrounded me and pointed to the Tigris where they swam in summer. I could faintly see the river as it wove through the valley, banked with greenery and melon patches. ,Later, someone commandeered their son to lead me back through winding alleys to the main road and the best surviving section of wall, high and dark.  Green parks lay to one side and on the other the gecekondus dropped steeply away. A Kurdish man in his fifties spoke to me when I reached the top of one tower. Gesturing, he pointed out the women, families with ten children, the immigrants from further south and east, who had fled or were forcibly displaced by clashes between the PKK and the army. They rebuilt village life as best they could, hence the multicolored houses, life spilling up onto the rooftops and out into the muddy streets.  Red peppers drying on strings, bright as necklaces, waved in the wind. When I asked whether the GAP project was bringing money to these people; he laughed bitterly, said something about energy for the west, about Kurdistan being the heart of the Middle East, perhaps the heartbeat, I’m not sure, my Turkish is uncertain. ,***, The next day I crossed paths with the ghost of a certain Englishman for the second time in six weeks, in Harran. The closer I came to Syria, the more familiar the land.  We’d traveled there in October and slept in the faded grandeur of the Baron Hotel in Aleppo, as had Lawrence of Arabia, Ataturk and Agatha Christie. When Lawrence came through Harran, supposedly he mistook the minaret by the ruins of the Arabic university, once the largest in the world, for a cathedral belfry. I rode a minibus from Urfa to Harran. Men leapt off purposely in desolate places.  They wandered off down deserted dirt tracks until I lost sight of them in the smoke of burning fields.  Small girls sitting on the open water pipes waved at the bus. I saw no houses. The water was part of the GAP project.  Some of the fields were thick with cotton; dirty bags of it overflowed into the road.,Harran sat at the edge of the desert but it felt like the end of the world. Having wandered between mud beehive houses with funnel shaped roofs, I came to the ruins of the crusader castle, once a moon temple, once a caravan saray.  Low and distant hills, man-made, rose at intervals from the Syrian plains. In the past they lit fires to guide the camel caravans safely through the desert. This place was mentioned in the Bible.  So was Urfa, where I stayed two nights. There I met M., a student in his thirties.  His room overflowed with books in English, Spanish, German and Russian, wishes, yearnings, each a fragment from a land he could not visit since he had to care for his mother and his schizophrenic sister. From the balcony I saw white tents, glowing in the night, a cluster of moons. ,The next day M. met me by the fish lake, where pilgrims feed the sacred carp. They say you will go blind if you eat one, but that might be a tale to keep the poor from stealing for their tables. Above, somewhere, was the cave where Abraham was born.  M. led me through the ancient streets, into courtyards where families showed us an Armenian church with sheep pushing over each other in the semi darkness, the floor thick with hay, basements with farm machinery, cats, shoes to sell and a vaulted stone ceiling centuries old. Pigeons roosted on the arches as the sun fell behind them. ,An hour before I left for the airport, M. took me to a friend. And there was a moment, sitting on the floor of a tiny room that opened onto a rooftop courtyard, dark already upon us, when I had eaten my fill of dates from Medina and had drunk the glass of water from the spring in Mecca, when M.’s friend had me place a ruby under my tongue for the health of my heart while he chanted prayers over my head. A moment I have felt before, of departure come too soon, a moment of being close to “the wild terror of understanding the other,”* that hit me again with each jerk of the airport bus. Each light from far across dark plains said there are lives here too waiting to be known, there are peppers drying, sheep clustered inside an ancient church, warrens upon warrens of narrow stone streets, mountains and hinterlands; beneath each ruin there is another.,-Sharon Olds, “Bible Study: 71 B.C.E",http://www.nassauweekly.com/eliza-macfarlane/,"

"Is Canada the new Seattle?  Not quite, or maybe just not yet. But with the recent deluge of artsy, eighties-looking, super-hip indie bands from America’s neighbor (The Arcade Fire, The New Pornographers, Broken Social Scene) our definition of cool has shifted just a little bit north.,	The latest of these bands is Metric, from Toronto.  Fronted by Emily Haines – whose claim to fame in American indie circles is one wicked cameo in Broken Social Scene’s “Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl” – Metric is the quintessential indie band, and Haines is the quintessential indie girl, the cooler, more stylish older sister of the hot girl in your local record store.  She’s Karen O without the shrieking insanity, Brody Dalle without the scary.  And she’s undoubtedly the star of the band.  Her voice is magnetic, at times gorgeous. It almost feels like the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s “Maps” all the time.,	Unfortunately, Metric’s lyrics are afflicted with indie-itis: they’re so bored that everything they sing starts to feel really, really deep, or just really, really jaded  This artsy, affected cool often works on the charisma of Emily Haine’s voice alone.  Sometimes, though, it’s too much.  Metric’s image is so cool that they become devoid of genuine emotional life at times.  There are just too many layers of irony.,There are the standard lines about the facelessness of normal life.  A few are pretty good, like the clever chorus of “Handshakes”: “Buy this car to drive to work / drive to work to pay for this car.”  But in “Monster Hospital” there’s also the trite and played out words of “I fought the war and the war won.”  It’s possible to make an album that touches on these topics – the Orwellian world we live in, the facelessness of society,  the fear of modernity – and still show genuine heart.  Radiohead make a living out of it.  But Metric’s words leave you empty.  And they don’t seem to care.,	The French whispers in “Posters Girl” and the cheerleaders at the beginning of “Monster at the Hospital” – done in an all too familiar disaffected tone – pile on the irony.  “Empty” is 6 minutes of nothing.  We get it.  It’s called “Empty” and the song itself is empty.  It’s brilliant, but that doesn’t stop me from pressing the skip button.  Sometimes a lack of substance is beautiful.  But in this case, it’s a whole lot of nothing. ,Sometimes there’s such a thing as too much disaffection, too much cool to handle.  I wonder if Metric ever drops the mask.  The comparisons to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs aren’t all that wrong.  But Karen O often shows real emotion, or at least a facsimile so real that no one can tell.,Metric is best when they work themselves into a nice, New-Wave, keyboard-driven groove and just ride it out.  The bass on “Too Little Too Late,” the pounding rhythms of “Glass Ceiling,” and the brilliant keyboard work of “The Police and the Private,” – this is Metric at their best.  At their finest, Metric sound like the greatest eighties band that never existed, and all you want to do is to dance around feeling the groove.,They come closest in “Ending Start,” where a minimalist background pushes Haine’s voice to the forefront, and she says “nothing nothing nothing” like she feels as lost as she’s trying to convince us she is.  Maybe if we get a sense she meant it more, we’d appreciate Metric on a more visceral, emotional level.  There’s no doubt that Emily Haines can take over the world; rock journalists can’t resist a super hip leading lady.  All we ask is that she drop the mask.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/too_hip_for_their_own_good/,"

"“I can choose a partner, I can replace him, and there’s ample resources out there. I don’t need to feel any responsibility towards them, nor do I need to spend any emotion. They can’t disturb me. Like a CD, if I want to listen to it, then I will. If not, then not a note is played.” – Muzimei,Chinese people have sex; you don’t get the world’s biggest population otherwise. They just don’t like to talk about it. Personally speaking, my parents never spoke on the subject until I left for college, when they imparted on me the all-important life maxim of “don’t get anybody pregnant.” Besides being cultural, the “problem” is also political. The Communist Party, in the past, did not encourage personal pleasures. And sex, being the most personal of pleasures, was at the top of the list. Of course, it’s easy to enforce such an ideal when everybody was starving and America was still the decadent capitalist empire to the West. It’s a whole different matter when the economic development makes the money roll in, American movies are available for 6 cents on the street, and everybody is eating Big Macs and wearing Nike. Not surprisingly, part of all this is the most American of things, self-centered confessional blogging.,It began with a woman named Li Li from Guangzhou. Either a publicity-hound or an aspiring writer, depending on who you ask, she started a blog titled “Love Letters before Dying” under the pen-name Muzimei (Wooden Beauty). Her blog, film-noir dramatic and exceedingly frank, talked about the lurid details of her sex life. For China, a country without Sex and the City to jade them to the idea of women in their 30s disillusioned by love and sex, such a thing was quite novel. Muzimei would often go on Carrie Brashaw-esque musings such as: “Sometimes, I think men are all the same when they are naked.” Mao would be proud.,At the height of her popularity, a third of the total number of Chinese who had Internet access read her blog. Part of her following, it turned out, was the Chinese Government. Li was fired from her magazine-writing job, and under pressure from her superiors, was forced to shut down her blog. She talked about sex, which was bad enough. She became popular, which was worse. And she named names of government officials, which made her dangerous. No one blames her for giving up the fight; it’s not in her job description to be martyr. With the Internet being the Internet, shutting her down was a brief stopgap, and a whole host of copycats came on the scene. They include Liu Mang Yan, the “Lost Sparrow,” among others.,Muzimei’s popularity propelled the blogging craze in China. China has 94 million Internet users, second most in the world. There are anywhere between half a million to 4 million blogs. They range from whiny livejournal blather, proving the universality of emo, to 20 year old yuppies reveling in their excess. If it is left at that, there is no problem. When the blogs become political, when they threaten to upset the apple cart, the government takes an interest. Dissidents have been arrested for posting articles on the Internet. Servers like blogspot.com have been permanently banned, while Chinese blog servers such as blogcn.com are periodically shut down when the government finds inappropriate material.,Thanks to the Evil Empire that we used to know as Google, Chinese censorship is in the forefront of American news again. In China, it is part of life. Newsstands in China are filled with magazines started up by aspiring entrepreneurs riding the wave of economic development. They all have one thing in common, a subject matter about nothing. You’ll find fashion magazines, celebrity gossip tabloids and everything in between. What you won’t find is anything with any political bent. It’s the implicit message in Chinese society. Want to make money? Stay out of politics.,Talking about sex is not politics. But it is openness. And openness can lead to societal instability when cultural ideals begin to drastically change. This is something the Chinese government wants to avoid. Change is unavoidable, but change is made as slow as possible. Homosexuality was only removed from the list of psychological diseases in 2001. In 2003, divorce and marriage laws were loosened slightly. The one-child policy is slowly being revised. But the ugly little truth is that when Shanghai’s bars close, 20 year olds will go home with other 20 year olds, no matter how many blogs are shut down. Young people will have sex with other young people; it is as unavoidable as the sunrise. But even for such citizens of major cities, sex education is woefully inadequate. And the unwillingness to open up is only exacerbating the problem.,The elephant in the room is AIDS. Africa is the hot zone right now, but the Asian AIDS problem is growing. There is a perception in certain communities in China that Asians can’t get AIDS, that AIDS is a “white” disease. The government, to be fair, has recognized the problem and has set up programs to provide free condoms and spread awareness. But there is still great reluctance to face the issue and people with HIV are afraid of the stigma attached to the disease, often refusing help. Intravenous drug users, prostitutes and other high-risk people are apathetic towards the problem. There are 20 year olds in major cities who have no idea what a condom is. The conservative attitude about sex and STDs still pervade. And the Chinese Government has not exactly had a sterling reputation when it comes to facing major epidemics (i.e. SARS). 650, 000 people currently live with the disease in China.  ,Censorship is not helping the problem. When Google launched google.cn, it faced heavy criticism, and justifiably so. Do a search on keywords such as “AIDS” or “gay” and you’ll find a conspicuous lack of the same articles that you would find when doing the same search google.com. The populace lacks the basic knowledge of sex that Westerners intuitively know simply from absorbing popular culture. Blogs, it seems, can have a role in leading the spread of information by pushing the envelope and testing the boundaries of governmental censorship.,Compared to 15 years ago, there has been remarkable progress in terms of the willingness of Chinese society to face issues such as AIDS, homosexuality, and sex education. An army of bloggers can’t fix these problems on their own. But it is the dream of the blogging nation to actually make a tangible difference, instead of being nothing more than idle Internet chatter. In China, where the fight for free expression needs to be fought on all fronts, there might be a chance.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/sexual_blogging/,"

"When Stephen Harper was elected the new Prime Minister of Canada, American liberals freaked out. I have one thing to say in response: chill out, seriously. I grew up in Canada. Two of my best friends were the president and vice president of our high school’s environmental club and volunteered for the Green Party. Most of my friends don’t vote for the Liberal Party because it isn’t liberal enough. You would figure it would be five-alarm freak out time, something close to a democrat’s reaction to finding that Bush won in 2004, or a pro-choicer’s shock at the ease of the Alito confirmation. So of course, when I talked to them, naturally they seemed okay with it. My friend Rahul, the aforementioned green party volunteer, told me: “As much as I disagree with Harper’s views on social policy, the man has a graduate degree in Economics so I can’t accuse him of being a moron. I personally am fine with seeing how a Conservative government will run the country.” My equally Liberal friend Jonathan said hopefully: “we’re going to have another election in 20 months anyway.” My crazy left-wing English teacher who once told us that the Conservatives were “evil” in class, said: “I’m not that mad. The Liberals really shot themselves in the foot and we need a change.”,	Harper didn’t win because, as the Family Research Council of DC said, Canadians suddenly found out they were “values-voters”. He won because the Liberal party lost. And it only took one of the biggest political scandals in our history, corruption on par with Jack Abramoff, to do it. And this is in a country that doesn’t have a history of Watergate, Lewinsky-gate, or any other “gate” to make us jaded. This was actually somewhat of a big deal and the Conservative Party brought it up time and time again.,	Canada does, in fact, have “values,’ though they are different from those of the average American. Canada is anti-American, in the way that a less successful younger brother dislikes the rich older brother, even as he is living in the older brother’s apartment and having his meals paid for. Canadians hate to be called the 51st state, because it simply reinforces our inferiority complex. When the United States is the world’s greatest power, and the sole reason that Canada’s economy and culture continues to thrive, this kind of feeling invariably festers. So in a visceral response, we like to think of the ways that we, as Canadians, are better. This includes a TV show called Talking to Americans, which involves making fun of Americans for knowing nothing about Canada. Of course, few Canadians realize that the thrust of the show is more self-mocking than self-celebrating, and we are like the nerd who make fun of the star quarterback for not knowing his name.,	So if conservatives in America actually think that the new election reflects a changing dynamic in Canadian values to be more similar to so-called “American” values, they are in for a major surprise. Harper took the most criticism for being an American lackey. He’s going to spend the rest of his term trying to not seem like he is blindly kowtowing to American demands, even if he secretly wants to. Remember the ads the Liberal Party ran?  The ones you saw on the Daily Show, the ones that said if Stephen Harper won George W. Bush would have a smile on his face? Those kind of worked, and don’t think it didn’t scare the shit out of Harper. His core base is too small; he’s desperate for the support of moderates. Veer any more right-ward, any more “American,” and he and his party go back to Alberta.,	The Liberal Party has ruled Canada for about 90 percent of its history. Here’s a quick recap of Canadian political history. Step 1: Liberal Party gains major majority. Step 2: Many years later, the Liberal Party, bloated from too much power, messes up extravagantly. This coupled with everybody getting tired of voting for them, causes the Conservative rule for a brief period of time. Step 3: Everybody realizes the Liberal Party is Canada and votes Liberal again. Lather, Rinse, Repeat.,	Harper’s party isn’t even a united party. It is, in fact, a coalition of the two major conservative parties, the very right-wing Alliance and the moderate Progress Conservatives, who upon realizing they would never win anything if they were divided, decided to unite. The Alliance can be described as somewhat left of the Republicans, or something close to Joe Lieberman. The Progress Conservatives’ views are somewhat close to a moderate Democrat. Until recently, they didn’t really like each other that much. This, apparently, is the party that forms the evil Conservative specter that will turn Canada into the freedom-destroying theocracy. At the absolute “worst,” Canada becomes what America would be if the Democrats won.,	And let’s not forget the most important point. This is a MINORITY government, meaning the Conservatives have the most votes, but not a majority. I will not go into how Canadian politics works, but suffice it to say, nothing of note has ever been accomplished with a minority government in power. A government needs more than half the votes in the House of Commons to pass a law. The Conservative Party has about 36%. The rest is made of the Liberal Party, the NDP (even more left than the Liberal Party) and the Bloc Quebecois (who hate everybody, especially the Conservatives since certain members of the Conservative party want to do away with certain laws protecting the French language). Ask anyone in Canada and they will tell you, a new election will come in less than 2 years. That is how long a minority party lasts, before it is forced to call an election. The last Liberal government, before this election, was a minority government. It “collapsed.” Therefore, the Conservative Party has two options while in power. The first is to go for the “values” agenda that the party base wants and try to enact legislation to ban gay marriage, abortion, universal health care, etc. If they choose this tactic, they will lose the next election. Badly. The second is to keep along the center, try not to stir the boat, cater to the moderates (since the right-way base support is locked up anyway). Then they might win again. Of course, nothing will have changed in Canada.,	A vote on gay marriage will come up soon, because Harper’s right-wing base will demand it. Of course, a good third of the Conservative Party are moderates with nothing against gay marriage. At last count, there were only about 130 members of the House of Commons out of 308 who would definitely vote against gay marriage. My gay friend at Trent University is not worried enough even to attend to a rally.,	The Conservatives are kind of like Hamas in this sense. Not in the blowing people up and being evil kind of way. In the sense that everybody got tired of voting for the corrupt ruling party and wanted a change, any change. Canadian values didn’t change, just like how the majority of Palestinians don’t actually support Terrorist tactics, but when a ruling party gets so bloated and old and ineffective, there is only one way to send a message. All hail Stephen Harper! Or at least, all give a somewhat lukewarm and indifferent reaction! May you enjoy your brief stay in office.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/conservative_canucks/,"

"When you were small you were as brown as a leaf in autumn. You were browner than the planks of our first house and browner than the old spool-bed in the room where you were born. You and your downy hair were the color of toast or weathered wood and your milk-white mother and I wondered where you had come from.,When you were bigger—long and lean so that boys watched you from behind uncut hair (how can they even see with all that mess in their eyes, we wondered)—you stretched out for hours under the sun in the backyard. You drenched your skin with tanning oil so that you might grow browner still and your hair more golden and the oil was scented to suggest endless tropical beaches or perhaps warm, sun-baked people but you had nothing to compare it to and every time you wore it I saw the women of the islands who used the same scent in their hair, which they kept coiled and pinned to their heads with wooden combs until the moment they would let the whole shining black curtain down and everything would be full with the scent—plumeria, perhaps, or jasmine. Or some other intoxicating tropical flower, or maybe the scent of the islands themselves and the salty skin of the people and the fruit and fish they ate, the water they bathed in. Even the day the air filled with thick, black, grease-fire smoke, the sweetness was there and seemed to me to weave itself around the scent of charred flesh so that I thought at first someone had set fire only to the flowering trees or to the women’s hair. Even now I think of the islands at work when the oil leaks out of the crippled cars and burns on the garage floor but also in the yard when you sleep under the sun and I cannot single out either a sweet scent or a bitter, burning one. ,***,The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, which fell on the earth; and a third of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven…and many men died of the water, because it was made bitter.,The end total was twenty-one ships out of ninety—less than a third. True, though, that many men died in the water, which was made bitter with burning oil and sinking ships. Mine was one of the first to go all the way under (“The USS West Virginia sank quickly,” says one of your schoolbooks), so what was I to do but dive free of the wreckage and swim for safety through the bitter water, through the sea which became blood and the fire mixed with blood. I wanted to be away from the great mountain, burning with fire, and I swam so fast and strong through the sea in which a third of the living creatures had died, and if I hadn’t—if I had died in the water with the other men—you never would have been more than a thought in the head of your lovely mother (who was I believe at that very instant only fourteen and cleaning the counters of a soda shop in Sherman, Texas).  ,When they found me on the beach they said, “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, son, what’d you go and do a foolish thing like that for? Hard enough to get out of the burning water alive without you like to choking yourself on a goddamned dime-store timepiece!” You see, they had found the golden watch in my mouth, which I had placed there, as a fish carries its eggs, for protection. I only lived, they told me, because the watch was ever so slightly too large to slide down my throat and stick there. ,I was a fool, said my rescuers, and I knew that I could not tell them any different—I could not explain to them why the watch was so important. I wanted to say—I wanted to tell them what it meant and why I’d be buried with it in my mouth to pay my way to heaven if I had to. Would they understand that I’d sooner have choked on it and been buried that way than let it sink to the floor of the sea? But the metal strap had bruised my mouth and cut my tongue and the saltwater had crusted my throat shut it seemed, so instead I stared up at my rescuers and pleaded with my swollen eyes for them to understand. ,Now, for you, I will explain about the watch and what it meant. You see, if the saltwater had worked its way into the cogs and wheels of that watch, and if the time had stopped, even just for a moment, how could the seconds and minutes and hours of my life continue to tick away? The very first thing I remember is that delicate, muffled mechanical heartbeat so close to my own.  My mother, they said, had left me that watch and they laid it beside me in my crib so that the ticking might soothe me—might be a mother’s heartbeat. Did you know that when you were small I used to lie beside you in your bed at night and listen to your heart pulse out a rhythm regular as my watch, and I would be a babe in a basket once again, feeling calm and possibly even safe? ,Things come back to me this way, triggered by your beating heart or the scent of you bathing in the sun. Light glinting off a boy’s car while he waits for you (while he idles a little ways down the block from our house, because the ones you go with don’t want to think of you having a father), the shining metal so like the silvered spoons at the orphanage. That’s all I remember of St. Jerome’s besides the ticking of my watch: spoons, strung up and dangled over the cribs to catch light from the small windows and calm the babies in their beds—the other children without even a watch to soothe them. The nuns had painted upon the wall God’s words to Zechariah: And I will bring the third part through the fire; and I will refine them as silver is refined and will test them as gold is tested. How many days—spent lying still and swaddled in sterile white—passed in glimmers, spoon-shadows on the walls, silver turning to the time kept by my golden watch?,***,Now the days pass in the shining metal parts of cars and the sharp scent of gasoline burning the tender skin of my nostrils at the garage. Each day I work on the local boys’ flashy cars, knowing it might be in this car or that one that you come home late at night, later and later these days and smelling of strange smoke and stale beer. And maybe salty, sweaty skin. Knowing I’ll see these cars linger on our block in the evenings, wondering if it is on these green leather seats or on those brown cloth ones that you are turning slowly into someone else. Someone from whom I can find no comfort: no calm in a heartbeat, no beauty in the scent of a flower.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/excerpts-family-history/,"

"My little sister has this disease that makes all of her limbs fall off. ,Her disease, it isn’t leprosy. One of the first signs of leprosy is that your eyelashes fall out, and hers never did. Also, leprosy does not make all of your limbs fall off. Leprosy is: a chronic disease caused by bacteria, a disease that leads to disfiguring lesions, nerve damage. Sometimes and in some places people suffering from the disease were placed in leper colonies. They don’t really do this anymore, though. Leprosy is not very contagious. We are not sure if this disease my little sister has is contagious, but nobody else has gotten it yet so we’re pretty optimistic. Or pretty dumb, Dad sometimes says. But I mean it’s not like he’d want us to send my little sister away or whatever.  ,When my little sister was seven and I was ten, her small toe fell off in the bath. It was weird, because Mom and my little sister both didn’t notice until they were draining the tub, and there was this little pinkish stub of something floating in the surviving bubbles. Mom fished it out of the water. It was soft, pruned, fleshy, with a tiny toenail. Mom screamed, and looked at my little sister’s feet. My little sister looked at her own feet, and screamed. The little toe had fallen off my little sister’s left foot. ,Mom stopped screaming after a couple minutes, but my little sister screamed all the way to the hospital, the whole time we waited in urgent care, through all of her appointment with the doctor, and the entire ride back to the house. The good thing was the doctors were able to sew my little sister’s little toe back on, but then for the next week my little sister could barely speak she was so hoarse, from screaming for like six hours straight. I guess it was pretty scary, even for me and Mom and Dad, too.  ,Three months later it was the same thing all over again, except this time my little sister was biking home from school with her best friend Claire, and also this time it was her entire right foot that fell off. It broke off right at the ankle, a clean break like I guess some people sometimes say. This time with the foot it was again with the screaming for like six hours straight, all the way to the hospital and then through her appointment with the doctor, but this time they did not immediately sew her foot back on—something about waiting, and seeing—and they also arranged for my little sister to stay in the hospital a couple days. Since it was the middle of the school week, I went and stayed at my godparents’, but Mom and Dad slept in sleeping bags on the hospital floor so it would be easier for them to meet with the doctors and make sure everything was going OK. My sister was in the hospital for like two weeks, so Mom and Dad were there for like two weeks, too. I started off coming every day after school but then didn’t come as much after one time, I heard Dad make some sort of joke about how the medical bills were going to cost an arm and a leg, and then he and Mom got in this huge fight even though Dad said he hadn’t meant anything by it, really, it was just a stupid thing to say, and Mom said yeah, stupid would be how I would describe it, too, and then they didn’t talk to each other for a while and I felt like I just wanted to leave the whole time I was there. ,When my little sister was in the hospital basically what they did was run a lot of tests. The tests didn’t fix anything, and they didn’t solve anything either. We are sorry, the doctors said, but we have no idea what is going on, here. I guess a really weird thing about this whole thing is that when my little sister’s right foot fell off, and when her little toe fell off, too, there was no blood or anything. There were no warning signs, no atrophy, no rotting. Both times it was like the foot or the toe had never been there in the first place or had been separated from the body long ago. And: later, when I asked her about it, my little sister said that both times it didn’t hurt at all, not the moment the foot and the toe each fell or and not after she noticed each was gone, which is weird. I guess I don’t really blame the doctors for not knowing what was going on, because the whole thing was just so weird. Is so weird. ,The doctors still don’t know what is going on. But, the doctors say, at least now you can anticipate things. And isn’t that some small comfort? They don’t sew my little sister back together anymore, after the time her right hand fell off and they reattached it, and then like ten days later the entire arm went. The whole thing just seemed so pointless, the doctors said, and Mom and Dad agreed, and my little sister agreed, I guess. I don’t know if I would’ve agreed. But my little sister has always been much more easygoing than me in this sort of situation. ,After my little sister had lost her right arm, and also (already) her right foot, her (again) left little toe, and her left foot, it seemed like everyone had given up on science. Mom turned to prayer: every morning she would, she said, have a conversation with God, although she never asked God why all this was happening, like I asked her to ask. Dad quit his job to help take care of my little sister full time, and when I would come home from school he would be looking up alternative cures on the computer, although there never seemed to be anything homeopathic for all your limbs falling off. It didn’t make sense, that everyone had written off doctors so fast. One night, while Mom was cooking dinner, I asked her about it: Hey mom, I said, have we ever looked into leg transplants? Or arm transplants?,Because I was kind of curious, and felt sort of strangely guilty like I sometimes do. Because I’ve got all my arms and legs, right down to the fingers and phalanges. Mom was putting broccoli on the stove to boil, and also I think praying because even though the TV was on some news special about child molesters she wasn’t looking at it and was sort of staring warmly into space and moving her lips, a little.  ,What? said Mom.,Well, couldn’t we find someone to give my sister an arm or a leg? ,Mom stared at me, and it felt like I’d said something really idiotic. ,I mean, I said, I’d be willing to give her one of mine?,Which came out as a question, and suddenly Mom was all kindness. ,Jenny, she said, sweetie, she said, I know where you’re coming from but that just wouldn’t work because, you know, if you gave her one of your hands or something, then you wouldn’t have that hand anymore yourself, and we’d be in exactly the same place.,And I thought, isn’t that how gifts and things usually work? Sometimes I have dreams about slicing off my fingers with a hacksaw, or dislocating my legs at the hips. I sleep with my arms above the covers, so that if I ever wake up in the middle of the night I can see right away if they’re still there. Because, see: I don’t want to give these things up, but I think I probably would. ,With the disease my little sister has, most things you’d want to keep fall off, and each time without warning. When she was eight, my little sister’s left foot also fell off, and then her left leg and (then, when she was nine) some of the fingers off her left hand. The pointer finger fell off in the classroom, while she was practicing long division on a January morning. Without her pointer finger, she had to find new ways to hold her pencil. ,The pinky fell off in the summer, at a picnic, in the middle of a game of hide and seek, and my little sister didn’t say anything about it until we discovered her hiding place. We found her last. ,My little sister is eleven now, and I am fourteen. When one of my sister’s extremities or appendages falls off, we wrap it in plastic, and store it in the extra freezer we have in the garage. It seems sort of cruel or something to keep all those necessary parts so near to my little sister’s old bike, soccer ball, skis, but we do. It’s not like we’re saving them for anything, but Mom says it’s nice to know everything is there, which I guess is sort of true. What Mom and Dad and my little sister don’t know is sometimes I make excuses to go out to the garage. I take hands and legs and toes out of the freezer and hold them in my arms. They are gummy and frozen and frightening all at once. At school, I told Spencer Morrison about the freezer and he didn’t believe me, so I invited him over. I took him into the garage and I showed him everything and I think he was pretty freaked out, really. ,Once when we were home alone my little sister asked me if I thought that once she got boobs, whether those would fall off too, and I said I didn’t know because I didn’t.,When my little sister’s last limb falls off, when she is torso and head, I’m going to carry my little sister down to the beach. Mom never lets her go swimming because she says it wouldn’t really be safe to go out into the ocean with anything less than two arms and two legs so as to keep yourself from getting carried away, what with the riptides and all. I don’t know that my sister really cares, because even when she had all her limbs she hated swimming anyway. But when her last limb falls off I’m going to carry my little sister down to the beach. I will carry my little sister across the parking lot, across the sand, and down to the water. I will wade out into the water, holding my little sister, and we will stand up to our necks in ocean for a while, at least until my arms get tired.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/arm-and-leg/,"

"blood of Lady Valentina Kennedy. Forced into marriage with the fearsome warrior of an enemy clan, Tina vowed to use her wild beauty to gain mastery over Lord Ramsay Douglas. Women hungered to be pressed against his steely chest … and men feared the brawn and rage of Black Ram Douglas. Ram swore he would make the defiant Valentina a dutiful wife after he had broken her hellion’s pride. But the girl he set out to tame became the woman who taught him what it meant to be ardently, maddeningly, gloriously tempted.”,I actually kind of liked this book. While milling a wee while at the Charlotte airport during a layover on my way to spring break (spring break oh-nine!) paradise, I had the oh-so-clever idea to write an ironic review of one of the many romance novels available for purchase at airport newsstands. You know the ones — embossed covers bearing titles like Secret Passion, or Dangerous Love, and displaying half-dressed hotties locked in smoldering embraces. I selected , a glossy red book decorated with a sensual close-up of a calla lily, with the full intention of bringing the snark, and hard. But, much as Lord Ramsay “Black Ram” Douglas catches “Flaming” Tina Kennedy unawares and sweeps her off her (dainty, white) feet, Virginia Henley’s period romance took me by surprise. This is not to say that it isn’t a horrible book, because it is. The frequency with which Henley uses the word “manroot” alone would discourage all but the most perseverant (or bored) of discriminating readers. What surprised was that , wasn’t anywhere near as horrible as I expected it to be. ,Based on the back cover, I expected the novel to be entirely devoid of anything resembling a believable plot. First of all, it isn’t really called “temptation” when you’re attracted to your spouse. It’s more like a successful and sexually healthy marriage. Secondly, are “hot tempers” really something to be lusted after? Whenever I display any signs of even a lukewarm temper, people generally try to avoid me. For instance, the other night, I screamed at a friend of mine that he wasn’t allowed to buy Cherry Coke at the Wa because it was “my drink,” and he didn’t seem particularly lustful. He seemed mostly annoyed and slightly embarrassed for me. I sort of imagined that , would consist entirely of descriptions of Flaming Tina’s flaming red locks and Black Ram’s fiery loins, loosely tacked together between brief bouts of incoherent “plot.”,True, such descriptions abounded, but there was actually a solid enough plot that I had to do some serious skimming to get to the steamier scenes. Additionally, my initial doubts were quickly put to rest. Ramsay and Valentina really were tempted, because it is so, so hard to live in the same castle and sleep in the same bed as your sworn enemy when all you really want to do is teach her the ways of love (because if you are Valentina, you are obviously a virgin despite your mysterious sex appeal, and if you are Ramsay, Valentina will teach you the difference between love and lust and somehow she won’t even mind that you’ve been plowing every Gypsy wench to wander through your village). I also became convinced that hot tempers are actually quite seductive in a lady: how else will a highland warrior know when he’s met his match? Guys like it when you do things like pull knives on them and call the cops on them. Needless to say, I learned not to judge a book by its cover. , plot was far more watertight and plausible (or at least intriguing) than the back cover would have you believe. Never mind the fact that Flaming Tina never actually displays much bravery or hellion’s pride, but instead practically passes out when she has to get a tooth pulled. ,Seriously, though, this book was actually startlingly well researched. I feel I can safely say that I have learned a great deal about Scottish culture in the sixteenth century, though I have not actually checked any of Henley’s facts myself. For instance, I learned that contrary to popular belief, the Scots bathed daily and had access to French cuisine as well as magnificent Arabian stallions. The novel covers everything from political intrigue to the common medical practices of the time. I also learned that Scottish “doctors” prescribed cloves for toothache, which, incidentally, my oral surgeon also recommended when I had my wisdom teeth out last summer. Apparently the Scots were far ahead of their time in matters medical, though it is also possible that my oral surgeon is far behind the times. He was a champion unicyclist before he decided to attend medical school. True story.,Ultimately, I would say I discovered what true fans of the genre have known all along (and have, in fact, posted passionately on their Amazon.com reviews): ,…slid in a brief history lesson in the process! It may not ALL be completely accurate, but the reader gets the idea of the behavior and events of that time…this novel has it all…Rebellion, Intrigue, Battles, Warriors, Sexual Pleasures…REAL MEN and REAL WOMEN. A MUST READ!” A romance novel can only be what it is (that is to say, thinly disguised soft-core pornography for sexually-repressed women), and Henley’s is better than most. I know this because I read three more such books when my plane home was delayed due to inclement weather (Seduce Me At Sunrise, which was like a raunchy and incoherent version of Wuthering Heights, and The Prize, which should have been good because it was supposed to be about pirates and passion on the high seas, but ended up being about basically nothing except sort of the War of 1812, which everybody knows did not actually involve any seductive swashbuckling).  ,manages to meet the requirements of the genre while still delivering a quasi-engaging plot and a history lesson (or at least, a lesson in how history could have been more awesome and fun for everyone involved). ,Now, riddle me this: how many “classics” can do all that? How many Pulitzer Prize-winners can be said to have it all? That’s right, you guessed it: none. , Oh, please. The only intrigue there is why nothing even happens until practically the last page. ,? Ha! Sexual pleasures, maybe, if you count one measly kiss and a whole lot of insinuation, but where are the warriors? Where are the battles? And don’t even get me started on The Road. The only sexual pleasure I got from that book was that I finished writing my paper on it before spring break and got to spend the rest of my week reading ",http://www.nassauweekly.com/tempted/,"

And your work in _Wild Wild West_! I mean wow! And he said, Thank you, you’re too kind. And I said, no, really, you’re great, Ken! And then I noticed that Kenneth Branagh looked kind of beat. And I said, Hey, Kenny B, you look kind of beat! And he said, Oh, it’s nothing big, really. It’s just my cat, he said. My cat has feline distemper. Distemper! I said. That’s terrible! But you’re in luck, Kappa Kappa Branagh, I said. My best friend Dan is a vet, and he specializes in feline distemper! And so I gave Kenneth Branagh the number of my best friend Dan, who is a vet who specializes in feline distemper. Anyway, later that night I told my wife the whole story. And she said, Arthur, be serious. And I said, I am a very serious guy! ,Because I am a very serious guy! ,MY REPORT ABOUT _CITIZEN KANE_, BY DANIEL, GRADE 3 ,For my report I am writing about _Citizen Kane_. Mrs. Lambert told us to pick a movie that we liked and say why we liked it but I couldn’t think of anything and Mom said that _Citizen Kane_ is a good movie, and so I watched it. Mom said it is her favorite movie but I am not sure that it is my favorite movie.,Let me tell you what happens. _Citizen Kane_ is about this boy who likes sledding. Then he grows up and starts some newspapers. And he has a wife. And he lives in a castle. My favorite part of the movie is that in the castle he has all these rugs made from bears. ,Probably you want me to tell you how it ends. How it ends is, everyone is wondering what rosebud is but Mom said I shouldn’t say what rosebud is. Rosebud is the last thing that _Citizen Kane_ says before he dies but you find that out right at the beginning, so it is OK that I said that. I hope you enjoyed reading my report. ,REAL LOUD NOISE,On the TV, on the police procedural, two detectives are talking with a little kid. Now, Billy, the tall one says, we just want to ask you a few questions. The short one says, But don’t worry if you don’t know the answer. Just try your hardest. Billy (he is the little kid) nods his head. Did you see anyone you’d never seen before? says the tall one. No, Billy says. Do you remember seeing anything weird, anything at all? the short one says. Billy says, No, I don’t think so. I just heard a real loud noise.,OK, says the tall one.  We are going to try something a little different. The short one says, here are some crayons, and some paper. Why don’t you draw us a picture of that day. OK, Billy says. Billy takes the crayons, and he takes the paper. The two detectives watch. Billy draws a tabby cat standing next to a flower. What is that? says the tall one. The short one says, Can you tell us about your drawing? It’s my cat, says Billy. His name is Max. He is stripey.,There is a break for commercial. I know who did it. It was Billy’s mother.,DO-IT-YOURSELF,I can’t put it together. I’ve tried, but I can’t. The first attempt, it came out a bookshelf—not what I’d intended. The second, one of those towers for cats to play on. I don’t have a cat. So I re-read the instructions—maybe I was doing something wrong. I followed each step to the letter, an a half-hour later found I’d constructed a doll’s house. I paused, thought. Yes! I thought. That’s it! I was one hundred percent sure the instructions were upside-down. I rotated the manual, took apart my tiny mansion room-by-room. Started from scratch: hammered, nailed, sawed, glued, sand-papered. Screwed, wrenched, painted; wrung my hands and ran them through my hair.,I stepped back to see what I had made. It was a tree, a terrible, beautiful tree. With a gold and purple trunk, twisting and knotted up into filligreed branches. The leaves, when they moved, sang like a tower of dishes lifted up into a high cupboard. (I think they (the leaves) were made of some kind of china.)And the roots! They snaked in all directions, to each corner of my living room, under and over tables and chairs and the sofa.,This was yesterday. Today, the tree still stands. I will have to un-assemble it. Like the bookshelf, the tower, the doll’s house, it is not what I’d meant to build. But this is the problem: I threw out the box the parts came in days ago, and I’m so, so tired from all this constructing and de-constructing.

"At that age we took our fascination in the lot of the adult world. Through the peers we put to turmoil – musky boys of brashness or slighted vigor, and the balmy girls, the sweet or mousy, the striving harlequins – we accessed the quiet amblings of their mothers and their fathers. Stoked hotly on the fuel of drink, these men and women let splash those pointed, woeful details of a life and its doings, taking our silence to be sheer incomprehension – done as if to sounding boards or cloud-addled therapists, or to motivate the face in the bedroom mirror. But we listened keenly, and from this bit-by-bit unveiling assembled vast patchwork mythologies, craggy pilings of refuse-bits and off-tone detritus. These occupied our harder thoughts, and gave to our world a lofty, pinchbeck centerpiece. ,But our edifice was achingly crooked, and dealt our view of life a harmful pivot: so that all things had a grayless clarity, with a light too sharp in some places and a deep of blackness in others.  ,Yesterday’s paper read: “Penelope Beatrice (Fare) Holloway died on Tuesday night of ovarian cancer at age 67. She is survived by her husband, Quincy Q. Holloway, and their daughter, Megan Holloway.  A noontime Mass will be celebrated on Friday at St. Benedict’s Church. Internment will follow at the Mt. Zion Cemetery, Portharbor, NY. Family may greet friends at the Blowser Funeral Home…”,Etc., etc., etc.  ,I should say first that our parents had a bleary disinterest in our interior lives, with no appreciable eye for those subtle, injurious events that breach a child’s mind and preside surreptitiously over its development. Instead, they thought of us as mere trajectories, supposing we’d incorporate only what was told to us or given directly: so that they had no knowledge of our moment-to-moment completeness, and did not suspect us prone to the seep of our surroundings – which was a type of osmosis we chased after, in reality, and drummed up actively on our own. ,Of our parents, Finn’s bore the vastest culpability; for they left us in that hulking place of empty rooms and lightless corridors, hosts to our most harmful, sponge-like times. ,Finn, Miles and Wezler were all fourteen, while I myself was only thirteen years of age. ,Typically when we arrived at Finn’s we bivouacked upon the lower floors. We tossed our shoes along the hallway, and cobbled together a small cairn of backpacks and coats to block the basement door. If his parents were home, we merely threw ourselves to arguing, or huddled roughly around Finn as he passed hours playing video games. But on certain nights – nights of harsh, lonesome winds, when the place was empty save for us – we wandered the house itself, scheming banditry to the wine cellar, setting fire to his mother’s throws and silks on the patio in the backyard. ,On these nights, too, we played explorers, and ransacked the house for his mother’s various stashes of pills. These were a queer hodgepodge of capsules and pain-killers, sedatives and herbal remedies, of heady vitamins, anti-histamines and adrenaline needles, prismatic and variegated and all clamoring up a loud salvific chaos that, in retrospect, evoked snake-oil peddlers and the knell of their rickshaw apothecaries. ,And I remember one day we found the river mouth – a deep box of lengthy red plastic – stuffed into the linen closet of a guest bedroom. This room was all trickled lace and doilies, an ailing, needle-thin space of tight damp walls that seemed clasped in some awful bodily fit, as if retching for air or laboring to shed dull spirals of its wallpaper. Its bed was set against the far-back wall, a cumbersome, steel-framed lug that, while finely done up, retained an air of yellow sterility, as if prepared years back for a guest who never arrived. And so it was counterintuitive to think how often the bed was actually lived in, and how often it endured his mother’s raw outpourings of humanity: Lila all sobs and trembles, damp in the face, choking down the sharp gnaw of whatever spat or struggle had, earlier in the night, caused her to take up her pillow and flee from her husband. ,On the night we found the bulk of the pills here, in this bedroom, Finn let out a sad guffaw, and a cloudiness took over his face; and he softly asked, Can you fucking believe it? Without regard to any of us, he strode unspeaking into the adjacent bathroom, halting at the toilet; and with a stare of stern comprehension – accepting and sorrowful, as if beholding the wreckage of an altar – Finn commenced to flush, bottle by bottle, the whole of this woman’s damning, medicinal potpourri. When he finished, he placed the empty bottles on the bed, and left the lights in the room tweaked to a glaring pitch of whiteness. ,He did, however, save six compact, baby-blue pills, little opiate ditties, that we split up between the four of us – one to me, one to Miles, one to Wezler, three to Finn – and chased back with pilfered swigs of wine on the night that Finn, straddling the tub of the selfsame bathroom, conducted our friends in the launching of the bags.  ,That was a night of joys and ruddy lusts, with wobbly bevies of boys roving and ripped on thimblefuls of alcohol, gobbling up liquors, all hankering to grope at that downy, pubescent element among us – the girls with the gumdrop tits, dimple-pinch cute and with faces lathered in rouge, who, in light of the things confided of them (for they had too-known lives, and were the reliable stuff of rumor mongering), became more than the girlish mugs of sloppy cosmetics, and instead assumed a prophetic quality – something like the visage of Moses, which was bronzed in its proximity to God. For these girls were creatures with truly awakened sexualities, provoked by so many tempests to do things and have things done to them that we – with our pimples and scabrous parts and poly-timbre voices – could not even begin to put words to, but merely conceive of incompletely, in half-ideas and dim imaginings, with sweat on the brow and a hand laboring along in the pant pocket. These girls denied all advances, preferring the older boys instead. ,Apart from them were the quainter girls, with ponytails and glittering lips, who were still panicky in matters of sex; Megan Holloway was of this latter group. ,At an unknown point in the night someone took the raw meats from the freezer and dumped them in a bathroom on the main floor, so that there was spoiled beef in the sink and toilet, and red flesh and animal juices all over the floor and staining the walls. When the party was tiring out – and when there was just a small contingent of us left, assembled on the trampoline and talking of pornography – two boys alerted Finn to the state of the bathroom. Furious and drunk, Finn marshaled them up the stairs to his mother’s guest bathroom. He gave them plastic bags, and said to fill the bags with shampoo and water and hair remover. ,At the time, I was among those on the trampoline. Miles was occupied on the aches of Lila’s pill, ordering me with a wide dopey glower to rock myself along with him. ,We’re on the cruise-ship, he declared. We’re on a seesaw. ,Beyond him was Megan, studying the back of his head. ,There was then a loud burst of soppy wetness, which gave off a flowery odor and a sharpness that dealt pain to the eyes. We scattered, craning our necks for a source. And then Finn appeared in the high up window, shirtless and drooling, whipping his body around and signing threats to us with his bare arms. His voice sounded tear-clamped, and he told us: ,Get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house! ,The two boys started throwing more bags; we writhed needlessly under the assault, too far from sober to produce a fit response. ,Why? Finn! I cried out. ,Get the fuck out of my house!  ,Tell us and we’ll go!,Finn then quieted, swaying in his shoulders, and tripped down from the bathtub to lean out the window. ,You fuckers disgraced my house. ,What? ,You see my bathroom? He flung his arms around. There’s animal flesh all over my fucking bathroom! ,What? It wasn’t us!,Yeah?,It wasn’t us!,And they launched more bags at us. I watched them fall through their shoddy arcs, formless, light-scattering things that frothed grandly and blasted upon impact. And then Miles collapsed, taken up with strange motions and sobbing for his addled sight. I’m drowning! he hollered. I’m blind! Megan scampered to comfort him, but in swiping her away, Miles knocked her off the trampoline. She gave an awful squeal, and picked herself up to run inside. The boys nailed her with a bag on the way, and gave forth a horrible cackle. ,Stop it! I shouted again. We didn’t do it! Finn, I swear to God! I stumbled off the trampoline, throwing my arms in the air, and said: ,Finn, I swear it, we were here all night, we didn’t do it!   ,There was an anguished pause. ,Swear? he asked. ,We didn’t do it. ,Finn came grimly to the window, his face stern and tinged with redness about the eyes. He inhaled severely, lingering on the sight of us: I with palms upheld hopefully, my hair damp and matted, the lifted bottom of my shirt disclosing a lip of belly fat; and those few on the trampoline, damp and furious, sprawled prone or crawling along sore hands and knees, cursing him plainly, audibly. ,Fucking dick, moaned one. ,Oh fuck me, said the other. ,With an evident, mangled pain, Finn tried to grin.,I was just kidding, he said brokenly. ,Fuck you, asshole, someone said. Finn fell silent. His face twitched abruptly. He said;,It was a joke.,Fucking douche, another. ,Finn withdrew his head from the window.  He said, It was a joke! A joke! From his abdomen, he rent a loud, hollow laugh. ,Fuck you! said a third. ,Suddenly from within we heard a loud crash, and Finn hopped down from his perch and set off scrambling through the house, and we heard him cawing and yowling, landing with swift loud thuds down the stairs, and the side-door flung open and there was Finn, a roaring sadness in the eyes, careening at me with a bag in one hand and an empty wine bottle in the other. I was fucking around, he stammered, I’m just fucking around. He leapt hapless, nearly tumbling, and with a swift thud felled the two of us. Howling, quaking in the shoulders, he shattered the bag across my back. ,He appealed to the few on the trampoline. Right? he said. Right? ,Collapsed into myself, retching from the sting, I saw that all above beheld him, mutely and with a look of vast revulsion. Finn then tried to laugh, and it was labored, timid. “Right?” he asked again, laughing. I saw the bottle shaking, I heard a tremor in his voice.  ,So I began to laugh, as hard as I could, and I laughed loudly and Finn then laughed along with me, earnestly, desperately, and then on the trampoline the ones soaked to threads with hair remover and shampoo, they began to laugh too, until all were possessed, ensnared in a vast unruly hilarity, and newly innervated Finn took a few steps back, and paused, and grinning hugely he raised the empty wine bottle aloft; and then, with ceremonial zeal, as if priest or functionary to a disappeared faith, he heaved the bottle onto the neighbor’s driveway. ,It struck loudly and burst, shattering into so many shards of glass. Immediately, the lights shot on above the neighbor’s garage. We tensed up, held our breath, stared. Just as swiftly, they went off. For they were motions sensors, soft and light, briefly triggered: as if watchfulness is an act done purely for show, to say that someone’s looking, but no one really ever is. ,I only later found out that Finn’s parents had been home, upstairs, sleeping sweetly the whole time.  ,At a point far later into the evening, with everyone panting, everyone wet, and when the trampoline held, to the best of my memory: myself, Finn, Miles, Thrum, Tom and Amory – ,Now Amory was reclined absently with her two legs tucked underneath her, a girl with soft features and unfurled, bushy tresses. She bounced her fingers, with swing, out along the trampoline in front of her, then smoothly flicked her wrist and indicated Finn. ,Aren’t you cold? ,He had his legs dropped out in front of him, shirtless and heaved over in his back and fingering his up-laid palms.,No. I’m not wet, idiot. ,She squeaked gaily. Tom knocked Finn roughly on the arm, he said: ,Yeah but we all are, dickhead, thanks to this dickhead. He tucked Finn’s head into his arm, glib and tousling ,him up in horseplay. Thank this dickhead right here! ,Amory grimaced loudly. Boys are so violent, she said.  ,Tom released Finn, with swats and guffaws, and glommed onto the topic. 	,Boys are so violent, he mimicked, impishly flicking his wrists and his voice high in his nose – and then hankered down on all fours and said at her: boys are so violent because we’re horny. ,Amory giggled. ,We’re all too young to be horny.  ,Finn turned to Amory. ,You want to pretend you don’t think about sex? ,Tom guffawed. ,No, she’s knows a little, right Amory? You know a little about it, he said, nudging and winking and all. ,How’s your boyfriend, asked Finn. She traced a finger along her thigh. ,We broke up. ,I’m sorry, I said. ,It’s okay. She sighed. My friends are unfair to you guys. It’s hard at your age. They like older boys. You’re just not – there yet, you know? ,We all smiled awkwardly. ,But I mean; it’s no reason to dismiss you guys entirely.,You guys can feel them, if you want to. ,Amory lifted her shirt away from her, so that she bore her nugget of a belly button and made at her bosom ample room for hands and arms. We approached cautiously, all bated breath and aching, and Tom put his hand up there first; and then Finn, briefly, and withdrew it – and Tom approached again, and Miles and Thurm and myself fell upon her, moving like some shambling, multi-limbed, vituperate beast, sloppy and groping, with great dumb smiles and hard-ons. ,All of a sudden she screamed: loudly, once, and then again, continually. We stumbled back, and saw: Amory prone, shirt torn up to her neck, pinned down by furious Miles, groping and pattering and his leg twitching uncontrollably. We were struck, horrified. Finally, Finn hurled himself at Miles and knocked him off the trampoline. Miles fell hard, biting his lip so that it trickled blood. ,Shit, he muttered.  ,We sat breathing heavily, all hidden arousal and terror. Finn gestured to Miles, who denied his hand and stood up to go indoors. ,For a long time we sat unspeaking. To break the silence, Finn lunged at me and we began wrestling. Finally all trailed off home, and Amory fell asleep upon Finn’s chest. ,Fuckin’ bitch, he whispered. How am I going to get up? ,Just move her, I said. He blushed, gave a puttering explanation, all bravado and excuses. I left him there smiling, and went inside. In the basement, tucked into the stairwell wall, I found Miles, sloppily jamming his tongue in Megan’s mouth. Miles and I exchanged glances, and I went home.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/garglepot/,"

"By November you already thought of returning, ,rubbing Vaseline into your palms and the crevices ,of your cracked heels. No napalm rained down in a foreign land,,no birth dates streamed across the screen to push our brothers into war. ,This wasn’t the Seventies, but still all you wanted was a little morphine,when you sliced your thumb, longing for the steam of subways ,seeping like tear gas through the metal vents, the breath ,and dust of a thousand trains, the roar of machines deep,underground, the world preoccupied, unconcerned.  ,Once you decided I would be an angel of reckoning, when we awoke ,surprised to have reached twenty-one unscathed, each limb, each lock ,of hair intact and only scars to mark life’s passage. ,You never promised to grow old, but allowed ,me to carry you to Canada, the car laden with smoke, ,quilts, the fishing rod tapping the window like a child demanding to be let go. ,If only every road could have run so straight, even progress through cornfields, ,over ridges and granite slopes, past pine trees aligned in regiments, blocking ,the night’s sudden descent, the sun’s late awakening. If only I could know,the shape of each love’s progression before the ending. ,Sometimes we must leave a story in the middle. No bridge burnt,between us, no doors leapt from their hinges.

"The Alex Adams award was established in 2007 in memory of its namesake, Jay Alexander Adams.  It provides financial support to undergraduates who elect to spend two months of their summer producing an original work of art.  Halcyon Person ’10 was one of the two recipients chosen last spring.  What follows are excerpts from her project, for which she spent the summer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, conducting interviews with members of her father’s and grandfather’s generation who had worked at the since closed Jones & Laughlin Steel Mill. ,***,1,They had an old joke in By-Products. Well, at least, that’s where Don heard it first. It goes that one day, a security guard at the east entrance sees a new employee walking out of the mill with a wheelbarrow covered in burlap cloth. The guard’s immediately suspicious, he knows that the guy is new, he doesn’t look trustworthy. So the guard checks the cart real careful, looks under the cloth, on the belly of the thing, to make sure the guy’s not hiding any tools, or any cables or metal that he could sell for scrap later. He can’t find a thing, though, and he finally has to let the guy go; there’s no reason to hold him. The next day the same thing happens. The guy comes out with his wheelbarrow and the guard searches him high and low, checks every inch of the cart, but he can’t find a damn thing. It’s just an empty wheelbarrow. So this goes on for weeks and weeks, every day the guard checks the guy, gives him a hard time, holds up the whole security line. He just doesn’t trust him. Until one day, weeks after that first time, the guard finally sighs and says, OK man, you got me. You got me fair and square. I know, I’m positive that you’ve been stealing from the plant, but you’re too good and I can’t find a thing on you. I’ve looked everyday for weeks, and if I can’t get you by now, you deserve to keep whatever it is you’ve been stealing. So I promise I won’t give you a hard time anymore, but I just have to know. What have you been stealing? And the guy, he smiles and pats the guard on the back. He chuckles and then says, wheelbarrows, of course.,Don had heard that one about a million times. He’d even used it a couple of times himself. And when he heard it, like all the other men, he nodded and grinned and pretended to be surprised when the punch line came, laughing and adding his own bit. Now that’s a plan, smart fella, who’d need a hundred wheelbarrows anyhow? It was ritual, and he liked it. Like saying the Lord’s Prayer. And everyone fell in line to hear it spoken. Some jokes were like that. A song that everyone knew by heart.,He was biting into an egg salad sandwich when they told the story. It was July, the hottest days of the year in Pittsburgh, and Martha had made egg salad, of all things. It was slick and warm, and each bite sat like concrete in his stomach. Pete sat down at the lunch table with a grin on his face.,Pete said that some guy in the wire mill walked out at the end of his shift, sweating bullets he said, but Don didn’t know what that could mean. Probably that he looked nervous, suspicious, but everyone was sweating, the newspaper said it was over one hundred degrees and the heat wouldn’t break until the end of the week. The guy walked past two guards before he dropped to his knees, falling like bricks to the pavement. He scratched his forehead on the hot black asphalt. Blood streamed from his cheek onto the ground. He sputtered like an old engine, and then screamed out into the humid air.,When the medics arrived they pulled off his shirt to resuscitate him and found twelve pounds of copper wire wrapped around his chest. He’d almost killed himself. The heat of it all under his bulky coat. Pete said it electrocuted him, but some of the other guys didn’t think that was true. Anyway, it was the heat, it clung to him and he’d almost killed himself for some copper wire.,Don threw his egg salad sandwich in the trash. He had to wonder how bad it was that a guy would think of doing that. How bad it was that they’d all sunk to that. ,2,When the mill closed, Greenhill got a lot of them. Men who couldn’t take it, couldn’t shake the bitterness of it all. One day, you walk into work and there’s a letter with your name typed plainly on the front, and to put it simply, the letter says that you should pack up your locker, head on out at the end of your shift, and talk to your Union Rep about when you can start getting an unemployment check. Ask when the food bank opens every morning, and what’ll happen if your kid gets sick, a weak cough stirring the night and hot pink cheeks pulsing with feverish blood.,Ray McCoy worked in the Blooming Mill, where they rolled ingots into hard gray bars of steel. It was early November, and jack-o-lanterns drooped from front porches—at least the ones that had been spared from the baseball bats of vicious teenagers. Ray took his letter and his last paycheck silently. He spent most of the night sitting on a barstool with half his shift. They bought rounds with their last paychecks, letting the whiskey sit in their mouths and burn their tongues.,Ray spent a few months doing the things the Union told him to do. He stood in lines, he filled out forms. He wrote a letter to Ronald Reagan. He even drove out to Ohio to try and find work making brick, but by then all the jobs were gone. ,He woke early one morning after about three months had gone by. His face was unshaven, listless in the dawn light. He stepped out of his bedroom quietly, in his boxers and a thin tee shirt, trying not to wake the sleeping house. After slipping on his work boots and grabbing his keys from the kitchen table he stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It had just snowed, and he was cold in only his underwear. Goosebumps rushed in waves across his bare skin, and he rubbed his arms and blew hot wet breath into his hands. Finally he opened the door of his car and slipped inside, closing it softly behind him. He sat in his car for a long time, staring at the dashboard and clenching and releasing his hands on the leather steering wheel. He turned his key in the ignition, pulled out of the driveway, and moved slowly, methodically down Seventh Street towards Route 60.,He reached the Fort Pitt Tunnel in just under an hour, driving slowly with the windows open, despite the mid-winter cold. His left arm hung limp out the window. When he got to the tunnel he slowed even more, his big Ford hovering in the middle lane as cars passed him with deliberate speed. He looked at the statuesque mountain, cut to its knees by men who had drilled straight through it, leaving two gaping holes, gashes to the granite that would never heal. He pushed the toe of his boot into the gas pedal and the car careened forwards, towards the wall of concrete that divided the ingoing and outgoing tunnels. ,A woman watching in her blue sedan said his Ford poured into the cement wall like a diver.,When Ray woke up he was at Greenhill Asylum. He was heavily drugged but he could remember the shadows of people moving across his thin line of vision. He heard a doctor’s low voice, explaining in technical terms that he was lucky to be alive. He saw the bright greens and reds of a grocery store poinsettia sitting on a chair near the door.,A few months later he was up and shuffling around the halls, a crushed tin can of the man he once was, hunched over and guarded. He spent most of his time sitting in front of a grainy television set, tuned to daytime soap operas or old black and white movies. He played with the belt of a cotton blue robe, staring past the T.V.’s antenna at the floral wallpaper.,3,Greenhill Manor closed in 1992 after the owner, Dr. Marlon Branch, cited chapter 11 and peeled out of the court parking lot in a light blue Beamer with new license plates. In less than a week they had evacuated, and the long halls of beige tile and floral wallpaper were empty, free from the rambling bodies of the men and women who seemed like they were only half there, anyway. They sold the stretchers and the mattresses, and some of the nurses even unscrewed light bulbs from their sockets and tucked bedding into their coats as they left, getting their last two weeks’ pay however they could. For a while they moved the patients around to different hospitals, trying to find them beds as far away as Somerset County, wherever there was room. The asylum held close to five hundred, and before long there were psych cases sharing sanitized hospital rooms with kidney transplants and cracked skulls. Some of them screamed in their sleep, some were bound to their beds by broad leather straps. But most idled on as they had for an eternity, flipping mindlessly from one channel to the next on televisions that hung above their beds.,It took a long while before realtors could sell off the property of Greenhill. It seemed surprising; the land was prime real estate at the peak of an imposing hill overlooking all of Sewickley. It peered down on Route 60, and it could be seen from every angle as one great summit. But still, nobody showed interest in the land for years, because legends clung to it, reminiscent of B-grade horror films. It seemed like everyone knew a story, a terror of electroshocks, violent rage, secret burials that Dr. Branch had subjected his patients to.  Even when Greenhill Manor had been a legitimate asylum people treated the place like a haunted mansion, and the building seemed to conform to its reputation, looking grayer, darker, more crooked and sinister with each passing day. Cursed, they said, like every soul who walked through its sliding glass doors.,In 1999 they sold it, building and all, to Wal-Mart. The super store put up chain-link fencing and plastered huge colored signs to each pole, advertising the renovations and the new and improved shopping center. They brought in bright yellow bulldozers and cranes. They razed Greenhill Manor to its cement foundation.,The first landslide killed two men. It looked like the entire earth was moving, sliding its way down to safer territory. If it wasn’t for the sound, like everything collapsing into itself all at once, it would have seemed almost graceful, like a well-choreographed dance. A dance where everyone knows their steps, everyone moves at the same precise moment with a ballerina’s grace. ,But Wal-Mart was nothing if not persistent. They shut down construction for a week, and started hanging an American flag at half-mast from the top of an unused crane. There were three more landslides, disasters that covered all four lanes of Route 60, blocking the road for miles, before they finally gave up and called it quits. Three more people died, and about a dozen ended up in crowded rooms, holding a metal fork with crooked tines and dabbing at their soft and pulpy hospital food.,4,Dennis kept a Bible with a worn leather cover in the top shelf of his locker in the men’s room. Inside the front cover was a family tree that he had sketched over the years, marriages and newborns, dates and blessings for new happiness. In it, too, was a thin strip of deep red silk with a tassel on its end, a bookmark he used to keep his place. During his lunch hour he sat on a metal bench outside and thumbed through its pages. Men who watched him said he looked like he was reading Braille. His thumb touched every line of every verse and he mouthed each word, his grizzled chin bobbing up and down to the rhythm of it. Occasionally he needed to push his wire frames back up to the bridge of his bulbous nose.,When he wasn’t reading he was preaching, putting his own spin on the words he read day in and day out, pontificating to anyone who’d give him an ear. Sometimes even when they didn’t. Whenever a new man would join the crew Dennis would pull him aside at the first break. He’d bring you close to him, your chests almost touching, and then earnestly remove his hardhat and goggles. He’d ask, his voice cracking with the weight of it all, whether Jesus was your personal savior. Whether you’d accepted the Lord into your life. Most men shook their heads sheepishly, rubbed the backs of their necks and tried to maneuver themselves out of the conversation. Dennis had a way of cornering people, his old Bible tucked in the crook of his arm.,“This place is a hell on earth, men!” Dennis talked a mile a minute when he saw his chance. He was constantly pushing his glasses to the bridge of his nose and opening his Bible to any old page, holding it before him, treating his hands like a makeshift altar. And the picnic bench was his makeshift soapbox, his boots stomping for emphasis on its slats. “Things haven’t been the same since the war. There’s a lack of morals, a lack of decency, and we’re all getting dragged down into the fiery furnaces of it all.” Men couldn’t help but listen; he had so much passion in his voice. “And who’s to blame? Who’s behind it all? It’s these women. Look around you. Just look. We have women with no husbands and three children. No husband but three children. What can that possibly mean?”,By that, Dennis meant the women’s trailer. When they finally built the women’s bathroom in a double-wide on stilts outside the main offices, it was long overdue. The women had been petitioning for what seemed like years for a place where they could change, shower in peace. But before long it became a place where married men could go during the lunch break. Before long, guards were catching men and women tangled in the stalls. Before long, scenes of men with pants crumpled at the ankles and women straddling toilet seats became common, and before long, people knew not to go in there unless they knew what they were looking for. People knew to ignore it, let it lie as an outland territory, wild and unkempt.,Not long after that things changed again. It wasn’t just couples groping among the faucets and soap dispensers, their pants and sighs embarrassingly loud through the thin walls. Women would up and quit all of a sudden. Women ran from the trailer, the buttons of their blouses ripped off and their hair wild and unkempt. Women screamed, their voices shattering the night. ,“You ask me who we can blame? Who’s behind all this? It’s plain and simple!” Dennis swung his hands in the air, the pages of his Bible flapping in the breeze he made.,5,Dill came in most days for his shift looking like hell, grumbling under his breath and swearing at the whole lot of women, all of them bloodsuckers and whores. It was Bess, everyone assumed, keeping him up at night while they rowed and fought. Sometimes Dill had scratches on his arm, long, deep wounds that ran from his wrists up his forearms and under the sleeves of his shirts.,It wasn’t a secret that Dill slept with a lot of women. He had a gentle smile and natural charm, and what’s worse he knew it, so no girl was safe. Guys joked that new girls were his prey, and all he’d need was a week to whisper a few compliments in their ears and they’d melt into the back seat of his rundown sedan. His best move was putting a paper cup of water on a new secretary’s desk and plopping a cut carnation in it. The girls in the office fawned over the sharp edges of his jaw line and his soft blue eyes. And people said that’s how he got Bess in the first place, slipping his hand under the ruffles of her skirt and tickling the skin under the elastic of her pantyhose. ,Years later Dill was that silver kind of handsome that tempted the young girls who typed pluckily outside the head offices. But Bess had grown round and blotchy in the years since they’d married. At the annual Management Picnic she usually wore big sunglasses and a straw hat that hid her pudgy face from the crowd. One summer they went at it in the line for hot dogs and hamburgers, and she stormed off, leaving him in the middle of Schenley Park without a ride home. He sulked in the parking lot, drinking a beer and tossing pennies at passing cars.,After a while she left him for good, screaming in the road outside their house and then pounding the hood of his sedan with her clenched fists. She took cartons of his cigarettes and crushed them on the lawn, and then hosed them down with ground water, got his clothes and his magazines and drowned them, too. And the next morning Dill was his usual mess, his shirt untucked and a limp, damp cigarette in his mouth. “She wants a divorce.

"This past Tuesday, President Obama delivered an address to cadets at the Starfleet Academy in West Point, NY, at least one of whom was repeatedly Asian and female. The subject of the president’s speech was his planned escalation of the war in Afghanistan, with a deployment of an additional 30,000 troops by the middle of 2010, bringing the total close to 100,000 at least until the middle of 2011, when a withdrawal is promised to begin. (Obama has been escalating the war more quietly throughout his term, having already doubled Bush’s commitment.) The speech was perhaps the first time Obama has had to convince the public of a significant policy on which he did not explicitly campaign—and, more notably, the first time he has faced more resistance from his left than his right. What follows are some annotations, measured and—whereas no mainstream commentators have been able to articulate a strong liberal critique of escalation in the face of an (admittedly) stronger humanitarian, legal and strategic case than that presented by Iraq—unmeasured. ,(Full disclosure: the author’s brother returned from serving a tour of duty in Afghanistan this past Thanksgiving; while it is unclear whether escalation would mean his re-deployment, the assurances of his unit commanders indicates not. In addition—since people tend to think this sort of thing matters—he (the author) believes the case for escalation is, among the narrow range of foreign policies politically possible in a country with a permanent and disproportionate military establishment, solid. Unless the Taliban destabilizes the Pakistani government and triggers a larger regional war or gains control of a nuclear weapon, in which case it wouldn’t have mattered anyway. So it goes with these things. Like a good liberal, his response to the “success” of the surge in Iraq, as well as the apparent permanence of the neo-liberal order (and concomitant patchiness of that order’s orderliness) has been to assert that to admit even the possibility of a coherent epistemological assessment of strategy with regard to “failed states” is to lay the philosophical groundwork for hegemony.),ON ISLAM,“[O]ne of the world’s great religions”—not the world’s greatest (that’s R. Kelly), but not a piddling one, either. According to Mediaite.com, Islam is the #2 religion, but trending upwards. ,ON THE SWIFT FALL OF THE TALIBAN,“Within a matter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels,” which are located in Pakistan: a very comfortable place and roughly equivalent to—if I may—Europe in Risk; no matter how badly the war in Asia is going, you can always retreat there and regroup for another round, knowing that eventually your opponent will get fed up and quit.,ON IRAQ—POLEMICAL INTERLUDE #1,“Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end. [. . .] Thanks to [the American soldier’s] courage, grit and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.” The only possible irresponsible end having been a withdrawal before the 2007 surge—which Obama opposed, and is now aping. “The chance to shape their future,” of course, could only be our gift of democracy to the people of Iraq, give or take 100,000 (take).,ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE KARZAI GOVERNMENT,“In Afghanistan, we and our allies have prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and—although it was marred by fraud—that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan’s laws and Constitution.” That a fraudulent election could produce a constitutionally-legitimate government—although it is illogical—is logical.,ON OBAMA’S DELAY IN MAKING A DECISION,“Let me be clear: there has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war.” This window afforded the President sufficient time to consult extensively with a death panel on how many thousands of troops will be asked to play Russian Roulette, an American game show hosted by Mark Walberg (no relation) that ran for two seasons on the Game Show Network from June, 2002 to June, 2003.,ON OBAMA’S INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAGES OF WAR—POLEMICAL INTERLUDE #2,“As President, I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I have visited our courageous warriors at Walter Reed,” with the exception of Dr. Nidal Malik Hassan, whom Obama has never met and does not resemble in any way, except insofar as they are both well-educated men of Muslim descent who have responded thoughtfully to the deep tragedy of ongoing conflict in Afghanistan by killing more American soldiers than some think necessary.,ON THE GLOBAL THREAT STLL POSED BY AL-QAEDA,“This is not just America’s war. Since 9/11, al-Qaeda’s safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali.” The safe-havens in question being not Afghanistan but—respectively, and to the best and most current available knowledge (“Wikipedia”)—London, Iraq and Bali.

Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency.” Unlike Vietnam, this insurgency is capable of retreating not to the jungles of Cambodia, but the mountains of Pakistan—a significantly colder climate, with terrain physically much closer to our airplanes.,ON OTHER SAFE-HAVENS,“Where al-Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold—whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere—they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships” with actors like the Iran-funded radical Shi’a Zaidiyyah rebels in Yemen and the government of Ethiopia in Somalia (which hasn’t killed protesters on a mass scale since 2005).,ON AMERICAN HEGEMONY—POLEMICAL INTERLUDE #4,“Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, through the service and sacrifice of our grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions—from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank—that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings. We have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. But more than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades—a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, markets open, billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiers of human liberty. For, unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination.” And that’s pretty much where Obama’s speech ended. We hope you’ve liked the last sixty years of American foreign policy; here’s four, eight or—take stock of the current field of politicians—forever more.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/obama-afghanistan/,"

"Morton Feldman was, it could be fairly said, the twentieth century’s most talkative composer. Always willing to speak his mind and rarely opting not to, Feldman told all in countless interviews and lectures about his life, his music, the visual arts, and the problems young artists face today and how to solve them.   He was, like so many avant-garde artists of the mid-twentieth century, almost as much philosopher as creator: he wanted not only to write music but also to change the way listeners heard it. A wisecrack with a towering personality — not to mention a towering six-foot figure — he dazzled and bewildered his peers with his directness and singular insight. When discussing his own work, he left few potential enigmas unaddressed. Yet as his critics love to point out, the music Feldman wrote, in the words of one admirer, “seldom rose above a whisper.” Sonorities change imperceptibly in a meditative stasis that may last for hours. Melodies appear rarely; when they did, Feldman sometimes dismissed the work as “minor,” as in the case of his 1971 choral work, “Rothko Chapel.” Structure, either harmonic or rhythmic, is often hard for the listener to grasp — a deliberate thwarting on Feldman’s part of the audience’s expectation of some kind of “system.” At first glance, Feldman’s music lives in stark contrast to his verbosity, his eagerness to wax poetic about music history or art. Today he seems to be remembered as a serious composer who compensated for his quiet music with loud words. Yet there is a significant congruence between Feldman’s compositional aesthetic and his philosophy. He viewed his own compositions highly — a degree of self-importance can be detected in some interviews — yet also as somehow crucial in the history of American composition. Feldman’s steadfast technique purposely denied listeners that which they had come to expect from modern music. He was acutely aware of formal and technical developments in the composing world, yet rejected most of them as manifestations of artists’ egos. Feldman wished, more than anything, to teach his audience about the beauty of sound.  ,Feldman, a lifelong New Yorker, developed a penchant for writing unusually slow and static music early on. He was born in 1926 to Jewish-Russian parents, Irving and Frances Feldman, who had immigrated to the United States from Kiev as children. Feldman had what he described as a “conventional” childhood in a house with “conventional” furniture. He began piano lessons at a young age with the Russian ex-aristocrat Vera Maurina Press, who had known both Alexander Scriabin and Ferruccio Busoni, and took up composition lessons in high school with Wallingford Riegger, one of the first American twelve-tone composers, and then with Stefan Wolpe. Wolpe seemed to make the biggest impression on the young composer. He instructed Feldman to consider the length of time it takes for a given sound to travel to the back of a music hall, reverse its direction, and return to the performer. Even in Feldman’s early, imitative works, one can detect a certain patience with sounds: chords last longer than one would expect from a Bartók or Stravinsky-style work. Wolpe also introduced the young composer to the noise-based music of Edgard Varèse, whom Feldman would consider to be one of his greatest influences (“What would my life have been without Varèse?” he wrote later). Feldman also recounted a time in high school when he and his friends formed a kind of composers’ club. “This had no supervision from any kind of teachers,” he said in a 1966 interview with Alan Beckett, “it was a marvelous thing, we made our own scene.”  Throughout his life, Feldman often criticized traditional music education (specifically, academia) for imposing “systems” like serialism or twelve-tone onto young composers. He thought artistic style should develop freely in individuals. ,Feldman’s full artistic liberation didn’t arrive until a chance meeting with John Cage at Carnegie Hall in 1950. According to the famous story, both composers attended a concert with a Webern symphony billed first, but left the hall simultaneously just before the start of the following piece, a Rachmaninoff, lest the modernist work be tarnished by Russian romanticism. Feldman walked over to Cage, asked, “Wasn’t that extraordinary?” and the friendship was born. Soon the twenty-four year-old Feldman found himself living in Cage’s building on East River Drive — the famous bohemian artist residence called “Bosa’s Mansion” — where he was surrounded by painters and composers. He arrived during the heyday of the famous “New York School” of artists. Cage, then 40, was a generation older than Feldman, and introduced him to all the important figures; Feldman mingled with Christian Wolff and David Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg and Phillip Guston. He lived at the center of the avant-garde scene in the modern capital of avant-garde art, frequenting artist hot spots like the Cedar Bar and attending club meetings of the New York School painters. He was, to use the modern phrase, a social butterfly. In one of his more nostalgic essays, “Give My Regards to Eighth Street” (1971), Feldman recounts his time at Bosa’s Mansion — of how he acquired his first painting, a Rauschenberg, for $16 and some change (he sold it late in life for $600,000), of the parties he went to attended by Max Ernst and Willem De Kooning and Virgil Thompson (“The faces of these people,” he writes, “Unforgettable faces”), and of a serendipitous encounter that led him to the critic Clement Greenberg’s apartment, where Greenberg and De Kooning argued over approaches to interpreting Cézanne.,In “Give My Regards to Eighth Street” Feldman also displays a clear adoration for the visual arts, which, especially at the beginning of his composing career, strongly influenced his music. (Of course, he loved to deny any direct influence.) In Feldman’s discussion of painting, some common themes from his philosophical rhetoric arise, namely a dislike of “process” in art and a rejection of “ideas” dictating the form of a given work. For example, on the term used by critics to describe the physical process of painters like Jackson Pollock, Feldman writes, “[p]ersonally, I have never understood the term ‘Action Painting’ as a description of the work of the fifties. The closest I can come to its meaning is that the painter tries for a less predeterminate structure.” He continues, “[t]hat does not mean, however, that there was an indeterminate intention,” i.e., that the painters did not put specific thought into organizing their work, even if it did not use past forms. What Feldman is driving at here, and what seems to be key to his time spent at Bosa’s Mansion, is that the New York School allowed him to compose his odd, patient music with a free conscience. “Freedom is best understood by someone like Rothko,” he writes, “who was free to do only one thing — to make a Rothko — and did so over and over again.” If living with Cage taught him anything about music, it was that every artist had the right to develop his own style, independent of historical precedent. In music composition, especially before the ’50s, that precedent — what with twelve-tone, serialism, neo-classicism, and neo-romanticism — was very strong. Feldman may not have abided by Cage’s “any-noise-is-music” philosophy, but he certainly gained confidence from it.,As mentioned, one can draw direct corollaries between some of Feldman’s early compositions and the work of visual artists. In an autobiographical essay, Feldman writes that during his stay at Bosa’s Mansion, “there was very little talk about music with John [Cage]” but that “there was an incredible amount of talk about painting.” The painting inspired him to convey “a sound world more direct, more immediate, more physical than anything that had existed heretofore.” To achieve this “ more direct” sound world, Feldman turned away from traditional music notation (clefs, staffs, note heads) in the early ’50s, and wrote a number of pieces using his own specialized graphic notation system — a series of grids and boxes that denote rhythms and general register but no specific pitches. Feldman was among the first composers to experiment with non-traditional notation, although by the mid-’60s he grew disinterested in it. Works such as his “Projections I-V” (1950-51), “Intersections I-IV” (1951-53), and “The King of Denmark” (1965) implemented the unusual notation system. ,Feldman’s scores from this period have an abstract visual quality, somewhat reminiscent of the brightly colored grid paintings of the Dutch painter Mondrian, for whom Feldman has declared his admiration on many occasions. “Projection II” (1951) for flute, trumpet, violin, cello, and piano in particular is aesthetically appealing, since Feldman left out grid squares for measures in which an instrument does not play. The “grid” of the composition looks asymmetrical, with holes in some places and detailed spots in others. Feldman, always keen on explaining himself, argued that the visual aspect of these scores was necessitated by the musical effect he was aiming for. On “Projection II,” he writes, “[m]y desire here was not to ‘compose’, but to project sounds into time, free from a compositional rhetoric that had no place here… Because the sounds no longer had an inherent symbolic shape, I allowed for indeterminacies in regard to pitch.” In the phrase “inherent symbolic shape,” Feldman likely refers to pitch relationships in traditionally notated compositions. Phrases of certain bar lengths, intervals that resolve in meaningful ways — all these standard practices were dispelled with his graphic notation. Feldman deliberately dispensed of any musical structure or technique that resembled a work of the past. Graphic notation, even if it did not stick for him through the years, certainly made his radical intentions clear in 1951.,And, indeed, the musical result is unprecedented. “Projection II” is a sparse, haphazard-sounding arrangement of pitches between five instruments. The dynamic range is slim, hovering between very quiet and mildly agitated. Feldman achieves color by indicating harmonics, pizzicato, and arco (bowed playing) in the pitch poxes (“A” for arco, “Pz” for pizzicato, and a diamond shape for harmonics). Register seems to motivate the piece — heightened tension occurs in moments when the instruments cluster together briefly in the stratosphere. Rhythm is indicated by the placement of pitch boxes within Feldman’s grid system, and the slow pulse remains constant. Yet for all the complexity and striking pitch indeterminacy that the graphic system brings to “Projection II,” the work’s most conspicuous feature is its orchestration (flute, trumpet, violin, cello, and piano). Feldman believed that the choice of instruments completely determined the sonic world of a given composition, since each instrument produces a unique sound. Even in an early work like the “Projection” series, it is clear that Feldman was preoccupied less with form, pitch relationships, or any formal aspect twentieth-century composers generally considered paramount, than with vertical, static sounds. Feldman articulated this idea in an interview with Paul Griffiths from 1972: “For me, composition is orchestration… Though my music sounds pretty much the same to many people, it’s very different to me with the change in orchestration; because my compositional impetus is in terms of the vertical quality, and not what happens in terms of the horizontal scheme.” Sounds in isolation are the focus of most Feldman compositions, which helps to explain their often glacial pace and hushed dynamics. He wanted his listeners to concentrate.,Feldman’s fascination with sound and his disinterest in the so-called “horizontal scheme” lent him a didactic tone in his interviews, lectures, and essays. He often took a contrary attitude during interviews, answering questions that should have received a positive answer with a negative one (and vice versa) or at least an oblique one, as if he enjoyed thwarting his interviewer’s expectation at every step. Nevertheless, he usually had something substantial to relate, whether it was his negative stance on the idea of compositional “progress” lurking behind most new works, his dislike of standard musical “forms” (like twelve-tone, or even the sonata), or the inability of most listeners to hear true “sounds.” In a telling 1964 interview with Robert Ashley, for example, he articulated his problems with “schools” of composition, as manifested recently by composers like Stockhausen. Most young contemporary composers, he argued, began by discovering a “mystical” aesthetic of their own, which over time was politicized and turned into something rotten. “By the time the young composer gets in touch with a particular work,” said Feldman, “it is already in a power struggle with other works and other ideas. The intention, the aesthetic of the work may be a complete mystery to this young composer. But in the form of politics it is not a mystery. It is very concrete.” In other words, as soon as a young composer discovers some kind of new sound or organizing scheme for his or her music, other composers latch on and quickly politicize it as “progress” or the “next logical step” in the development of the classical tradition. As a result, the imitators become so-called “revisionists.” The revisionist, according to Feldman, “takes things from that mysterious region of originality and gives those things a man-made rationale.”  ,“Revisionist” schools are prevalent in twentieth-century music history: the Second Viennese School fostered the development of Schoenberg’s twelve-tone system in the ’20s and ’30s; Milton Babbitt and other serialists held court at “progressive” music conferences at places like Princeton University, where composers gathered to exchange their latest ideas and bask in the technical complexity of their developments. Feldman particularly detested Stockhausen, finding it “interesting” how he “enjoys having around him a large coterie of young people, and how much he enjoys talking and lecturing — converting people.” Perhaps because of the singularity of his own body of work, Feldman criticized composers who imitated each other’s methods. (He also took great pains to downplay as much as possible any direct musical influence that his own “New York School” might have imposed on him. Those guys were all about individual style.) Later in the same interview, Feldman commented that “the reason music is ailing is that everybody is still following the same historical process… that Art comes from Art.” Process hampers originality.,Bearing these thoughts in mind, Feldman’s music seems less passive and mellow, and more like a radical statement against the norm. Feldman knew well that his sometimes agonizingly slow music was difficult for listeners to digest. He genuinely wanted to probe his audience to explore new possibilities of appreciation of what sounded “abnormal.” He had no qualms about discussing his own composition methods — he loved to talk about sound as if it were a musical deity, and was usually frank about how he achieved a particular acoustical effect for the listener. The following passage, from a long and intriguing interview with Walter Zimmerman from 1975, could be called the “Morton Feldman manifesto on sound”:,Feldman exhibits an almost emotional attitude toward music, as if he genuinely felt the need to “free” sounds from the cruel bonds of serialism and other “revisionist” schools. In a way, he anthropomorphizes the role of sound in music history. Sound “breathes” and can be abused by those with “vested interests.” If a system exists to organize it, you “shouldn’t know” it’s there. More than anything, Feldman avidly downplay the role of “composer-as-egoist” or “composer-as-ingenious-hero.” During a time when serial composers philosophized about the superior intellectual nature of their avant-garde work (Milton Babbitt’s 1958 essay, “Who Cares If You Listen?” comes to mind), Feldman calls for the opposite action: Give sound the room to speak for itself, and it will be meaningful. Do not impose your will or your technique on the music. In the same Zimmerman interview, Feldman professed, “I feel that I listen to my sounds, and I do what they tell me, not what I tell them. Because I owe my life to these sounds.”  ,When you listen for the acute acoustical effect Feldman inked on the page, Felman’s music becomes all the more powerful. Feldman sought beauty in the purest distillation of sounds that could be produced by traditional instruments. He once said that he has “yet to hear” a trombone player produce a pure tone without any attack. He did eventually write more tuneful and accessible works during his middle period, such as “The Viola in My Life” (1970) and “Rothko Chapel” (1971), but he always held that his early, sparse work was equally important. He said that audiences must “earn the right to like [my later works] by getting to know my earlier works first. I want them to forget their background and their education.” The degree to which Feldman rejected historical precedent in classical music can be somewhat surprising. But he was right: trying to understand Feldman in the context of, say, Beethoven or Schoenberg makes little sense.,Feldman’s compositional development culminated during his later years in very long, slow-changing works. “Piano and string quartet” lasts about 80 minutes, “String Quartet (II)” between five and six hours. Where Feldman described some of his earlier compositions as establishing a new harmonic world with each chord change, in these later pieces he often tried to achieve similar effects by inverting the same chord over and over again. Perhaps he was referring to these static inversions when he wrote in his 1973 essay, “The Anxiety of Art,” that he was content “to be continually rearranging the same furniture in the same room.” Feldman’s late-period explorations in sound are almost as difficult for the listener as for the performer, requiring a sort of meditative state. They utterly banish time from his composing scheme. (It should be mentioned that Feldman outright rejected the possibility that his music was related to Buddhism or Eastern philosophy, which heavily influenced the music of Cage.) Again, as in his earlier pieces, the listener is not expected to follow the formal structure, but instead to contemplate each inversion of a given chord in isolation — vertical sound over the horizontal scheme. The scale has just been magnified.,It is hard to say exactly what prompted Feldman to become such a forceful reactionary against the notion of “musical progress.” He disdained academia and the egos it fostered (he worked for his family’s coat business until he was 44). Certainly his time with Cage and the New York School of artists was influential, freeing him from the bonds of music history to do one thing over and over again: make a “Feldman.” Another plausible factor is that he was Jewish. Feldman professed to feel no connection to the tradition of Western tonality — to the idea that any emotional weight was inherent in a diminished chord or, say, the resolution of the dominant to the tonic. Sometimes he seemed not even to believe in music history. In the Griffiths interview, he strangely commented that he didn’t “feel that Beethoven really emerged from Mozart and Haydn.” At the very least, he thought that Beethoven actively experimented with the old musical forms. Feldman defended implacably that each artist should be free to express his or her “mystical aesthetic” apart from outside pressure and musical politics. His own music is a veritable manifestation of this notion. Feldman could have incorporated swooping melodies, eight-bar phrases, or intervallic structure into his music — perhaps, on occasion, he was tempted to — but to do so would have been to break his own model, his philosophy. Morton Feldman was content to invert a set of chords for hours at a time. Unlike most of us, he discovered therein fantastically unique acoustical realities.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/art_comes_from_art/,"

"The Nassau Weekly: Could you tell me about the circumstances of the paper’s founding?,Marc Fisher: Well, it started when I was a junior. A bunch of us from press club started up a paper called Friday, which was intended to do a couple of things. The Prince at the time did not do any features — any sports features, any arts features — they were just strictly news. So we thought there was an enormous gap that could be filled. Friday was also conceived of as a way to — all of us who started it were in the Press Club, and we were frustrated that we didn’t have an outlet on campus  where people could read the stories that we were writing for newspapers in New York and Philadelphia and throughout N.J., so we decided that we would start a weekly paper called Friday that would be very oriented towards the weekend,  things to do on campus, the arts, sports. We started Friday in the spring of my junior year as kind of a trial run to see if we could do it, to see if we could afford it — just to see if we could get it going as a pilot. And it was a lot of fun. We thought it was something we could move forward on, and all of us who were involved in the project were writers, and we didn’t have anyone with a business mind, so we took the summer between my junior and senior year to figure out how to do this in a sustainable way. So we needed to recruit some people with more of a business mind to get it going in the fall, and so by the time my senior year rolled around, we had to change the concept a little bit, change the name to Nassau. We had recruited a couple of business types who were very different personalities. There was a guy named Andrew Carnegie Rose ’82, and another named David Bookbinder ’82. They could work on producing the paper as well as getting advertising, getting the typesetting machinery and all the stuff that we needed.  One I think we recruited from Business Today, which was a sort of business-oriented magazine that was — I don’t know if it still exists…,NW: Yeah, it’s still a big deal on campus. ,MF: Un-huh. Well, I don’t know where we got the other one from, but somehow we figured out that he had sort of a business mind. And that did the trick. We got the production machinery that we needed, and we had a business plan, and we had salesmen going out and selling advertising, and we got office space, and we just started rolling and started bringing in some new writers who we recruited from the creative writing program, more literary publications on campus, the arts groups on campus, from the McPhee class and the other Humanities Council classes where there was a lot of creative writing going on — and basically reached out to those folks and said, you know, here’s a place where you won’t have the restraints that you have at the Prince, and you could write essays and criticism and features and all that. ,NW: Were the other guys that are now associated with the paper’s founding, like David Remnick ’81 and Bob Faggen ’82, in on the ground floor with Friday as well? ,MF: No — well, David was, to some extent, because he was in Press Club. But the main folks who were behind Friday were, aside from me, Steve Reiss ’79 and Alex Wolff ’79. And we sort of recruited other Press Club members to provide content. But the three of us were the main movers behind Friday.,NW: So Faggen and Remnick came in your senior year, once the paper had become Nassau.,MF: Yeah. And Bob was somebody I knew from high school, and I thought of him as someone who could combine a good business mind with a good journalism mind, and thought of him as someone who could keep this going, because most of us who were involved in putting it together were seniors by that point, and so we were looking for some folks from the class below us to be in from the start but who would make this a lasting venture. ,NW: When you say you knew Bob Faggen from high school — did you two go to the same high school?,MF: Yes, we both went to Horace Mann in New York. 	,NW: So where was this first office space they got you guys?,MF: The first office was in a little room up above what was then Commons, in the tower right next to Holder Hall. The University gave us far more space that we needed, but it was great to have a newsroom where we also did production. It was a big sprawling room — we had our own typesetter. This was in the early days of cold type, so there was a separate computer that would then spit out the type, and when we were really in a crunch we would actually write the stories directly onto the typesetter, rather than write and edit them in advance. ,NW: And did Nassau stay at that location for the rest of your time at Princeton?,MF: Yes. I think it was there for several years — I don’t know how long after I left. ,NW: So it sounds like you were looking to found a lasting paper from the get-go.  ,MF: That was the idea, because we wanted a lasting place for Press Club stories to be read and seen on campus, and we also wanted to fill this gap that existed because the Prince was such a dull and narrow newspaper. So there was this panic that set in at the Prince, and they immediately started up a features section once a week on Fridays to compete with us. So they did start writing some features, they did starting covering some arts events, but they were totally unwilling to go the way that we went, which was a much more discursive and irreverent path. In those first years there was not this emphasis on funny stuff that Nassau got into later on — it was probably a more serious, journalistic paper than it became. But by the standards of the times, we were pretty far out there, compared to the Prince. ,NW: I see. So the original intent was almost to beat the Prince at its own game.		,MF: Yes. It was to feature more magazine writing, more non-fiction literature, whereas the Prince was your basic wire service, who, what, and where approach. ,NW: Sure — but you thought of yourselves as “journalists.”	,MF: Oh, absolutely. And a lot of what became the standard features of Nassau were very reporting-based. Like the Verbatim column, where we were very rigorous about checking that everything that ran had really happened. So we were definitely trying to apply real newspaper standards to the paper, even if we were trying to get into the — you know, this was the period of the New Journalism, the ’70s, there was a much more aggressive and irreverent approach from magazines like New Times and New York and the National Lampoon, and so on — so we were very much swayed by those new magazines. ,NW: It’s appropriate that you use the word “irreverent,” because that’s one thing about the Nass that hasn’t changed. Did you all ever have any notable run-ins with the powers that be on campus in that first year?,MF: I don’t think we really did. The run-ins tended to be more with the Prince. The Prince was not happy with our existence. They didn’t want us to be getting the talented writers on campus; they didn’t like the fact the University was giving us rooms to work in. And then we also had some internal squabbles and problems, such as the fact that our business manager managed to wrap his car around a tree, and he was the only guy on the staff that had a car to get the pages to the printer each week. But the University was very pleased to have us there as an alternative to the Prince, and so they started feeding us advertising for campus events, that really kept us going. They were happy to have us there as a prod they could use against the Prince. ,NW: Speaking of advertising, it sounds like you guys had a functional business model — advertising covered your costs. ,MF: Pretty much. We did not get any direct outlay from the University except for the free office. Although I think we may have gotten money to buy the typesetting equipment. But we didn’t get any operating dollars from the University … Looking back on it, it’s kind of miraculous that we were able to just start up and get moving, and the only real challenge we had each week was filling the damn thing. So there were plenty of production nights where we were just writing stories to fill space, right on deadline. But the financial side seemed to be working okay, at least that first year. ,NW: So it sounds like the Nass was very much an extension of your extracurricular life, and did not emerge so much from your studies. ,MF: No, not at all. It was really almost entirely a selfish desire to have all these stories that those of us in Press Club wrote about issues and people on campus appear on campus. It was a way of helping ourselves, because when we were calling up professors or administrators for the stories we were writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer or the New York Times or the New York Daily News, they were always confused, because Press Club has this very strange relationship with the University. The University never knew quite what to make of us because we were not quite professional journalists and we weren’t quite students, but we were writing for these big newspapers. So it was a way for us to get the stories out, have our friends and the adults on campus see what it was that we were writing. ,NW: Would you print articles that you were running in, say, the Inquirer, in the Nass as well?,MF: Yeah — they would have to be changed, as we had written them for an off-campus audience. So to just turn around and reprint those stories wouldn’t quite work — nor would it be terribly ethical. But it was a way to double up on the use of the same reporting. So you could go out and do a bunch of interviews if you were writing about drug busts on campus, and use the same interview to write for the Trenton paper and then write something for Nassau. Obviously you’d write it in a different way — you’d probably go out and do a little more work, talk to students in a way that you wouldn’t need to for the big newspaper. So it was not simply a matter of putting a carbon copy of the Trenton Times story in Nassau.,NW: So it was recycling the journalistic legwork as opposed to the articles themselves.,MF: Exactly. And it very quickly moved beyond that model. Within the first few weeks, we were getting a whole new bunch of writers on Nassau who had nothing to do with Press Club. And it also turned out to be a huge time drain, because folks in Press Club in those days were spending 20 to 40 hours a week just on Press Club, and to throw the conceptualization and production of this newspaper on top of that was just way over the top. So we were quickly looking for people to come in and take over Nassau from us. So we all kept writing for it, but we very quickly found a new cadre of people to do the production work. ,NW: So even though Nassau began as a kind of appendage to the Press Club, it intentionally and very quickly became its own entity.,MF: Exactly. And I don’t know if we had foreseen that, but it became obvious very quickly that that was what had to happen. And that was fine, because it was still a fun place to write stuff that we couldn’t write for the newspapers that we worked for. ,NW: Any notable anecdotes from the first year of the Nass-Prince rivalry?,MF: We had no problem with using writers from the Prince, but the Prince was totally vindictive about this, and banned anyone who wrote for Nassau from writing from the Prince. So we had some writers who were in a really difficult position, where they wanted to write for both and that simply wasn’t allowed. We had some people who started writing for us that got recruited by the Prince — I think Lisa Belkin ’80 was one of those. She wrote her first story for me when I was editing the paper. It was a profile of the conductors of the Dinky. It was just this beautiful, elegiac piece about these sad couple of guys who ran the train back and forth all day. It was one of our first stories — beautifully photographed. The Prince editors noticed it and recruited her, and we had a little back-and-forth about that. It was mostly a friendly rivalry. We felt enormously superior to them because we were totally open to people doing whatever they wanted, and the Prince was much more anal about it, and wanted to only have their exclusive staff.  ,NW: Was there an eating-club angle to the Nass? Did Nassau people tend to be in certain clubs?,MF: The Prince had a very strong relationship with… which club was it…,NW: Tower?,MF: No, it wasn’t Tower. It was the one sort of across from Colonial. ,NW: Quad?,MF: No… also starts with a ‘c,’ right?,NW: Cannon?,MF: Not Cannon, but the next one down… something ‘Inn’?,NW: Cloister?,MF: Yeah, it was Cloister. There was a very strong Cloister connection. We had a story that totally pissed off the Princetonian editors about the incestuous relationship at Cloister between the Student Government students and the Princetonian editors. We portrayed it as this club-within-a-club where the powers that be on campus came together and socialized and plotted what the issues the Prince would cover. And probably our story was too conspiratorial — the Prince editors were deeply upset by this. Nassau people, on the other hand, fancied ourselves more misfits and outsiders, and most of us were not in a club,  independent, or in one of the two residential colleges. ,NW: What departments were you guys in?,MF: I’d say most of us were in History, English, Comp Lit. Politics, some Wilson School. But there was definitely a heavy humanities focus. And there was definitely a McPhee mafia that formed the spine of Nassau. Virtually everyone in Press Club was a John McPhee acolyte, and that was very much true of the Nassau crowd as well. His influence was just pervasive. Which was curious, because he’s not exactly a radical when it comes to writing styles — in fact, he’s fairly conservative. But even in that period of Tom Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin, and this crazy new kind of journalistic writing, we were enraptured with that, but also grounded in this rigorous, reporting-rich journalism that McPhee preached. What’s curious to me is… I’ve never really quite understood what the pivot point was when the paper went from being a very reported, more traditional journalistic paper to the even more irreverent, more comment-focused paper it became over the years. It became much funnier, and that became much more the focus. In its best years, it was really good at that. But that beginning identity as more of a heavily reported, newsy paper vanished. That became less of a focus after just a few years. And that may be because the Prince started to play catch-up. ,NW: Did you ever think this thing would last thirty years?,MF: No — I don’t think I ever thought that far ahead. But we definitely wanted to figure out a structure that would last beyond our senior year — that was our main goal. I don’t think any of us were really thinking much beyond that. But we did think the Prince had left this enormous gap wide open for us, and even as they tried to fill that gap, there were a lot of things we could do a lot better. And so I think we felt that so long as Press Club was around, there ought to be a lasting alternative paper. But I’d be shocked if anyone you talk to says they thought it would last decades.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/marc_fisher_interview/,"

"The thin strap of a duffel bag cut into Milo’s shoulder as he stood on the front step of the old house where he grew up. He studied a painfully new, gold mailbox that dangled a limp newspaper in its protruding tongue. He studied how it contrasted so sharply with the peeling, faded blue paint of the house that he had chipped off with his fingernails as a child. He began counting in his head, promising himself that he would ring the doorbell when he got to ten.,“You’re home!” his mother squealed as she swung open the front door, leaving only a thin metal screen between their faces. “Come in, come in, you’re just in time. Dinner is almost ready.” She was wearing a heavy necklace made of amethyst and jade stones, rounded like fish scales, the kind of necklace Milo remembered holding as a small child in his palms. ,“Mom.” He struggled to squeeze himself and his bag through the narrow doorway, until, with one last pull forwards, he propelled himself back ten years, his feet landing noisily on the hardwood floor of the foyer. His ceramic artwork from elementary school sat on a coffee table close by.,“Give me a hug.” She struggled to fit her arms somewhere comfortably over his bag and bulky suit jacket. She finally rested her forearms on his wide shoulders and looked into his eyes. She paused, taking him in, adjusting her eyes to his five o’clock shadow. To a body she should recognize.,Milo slowly broke away from her grasp and moved to put down his duffel bag in a corner, near the stairs. Those fourteen creaking steps he had climbed and descended, as his legs lengthened and his feet grew out of pairs of sneakers. By twelve he could take the stairs two at a time. ,“How was your flight? Did you get to see a good movie?”,“I caught up on some paperwork. It was some horrible romantic comedy, I think. Who is that guy with the southern accent and the blond hair?”,“I can’t keep them straight anymore. I’m sure they fed you next to nothing, you must be starving. We’re having chicken cordon bleu!”,His favorite. He saw that the bookshelves had been dusted and that fresh flowers sat in every free space around the living room. It stung Milo, a little bit, that she had to force this chitchat with him, treat him like a guest, at a time like this. But he had been gone too long for her to skip this small talk. Six years with barely a phone call. Six years. So now they were in some kind of primer for the real conversations, the necessary stretching before the big game, before she could tell him that as her father died slowly, his body only animated by the pumping, beeping machines that surrounded his hospital bed, a part of her died slowly, too. But, Milo thought, at least they were making the motions; at least, at some point, the two of them would be able to actually speak.,“So how is Sarah? Beautiful as ever?” She smiled in the knowing way a mother smiles when she accepts that her son is in love with a woman, a woman who isn’t her.,She had only seen photographs that Milo sent once a year around Christmastime, photos of the two of them on vacation, kissing at the beach, his palm in the perfect indent between her shoulder blades. There was something in Sarah’s face that let his mother trust her. It may have been her eyes. His mother swore that when Sarah looked at Milo in one picture, the two of them leaning against a metal rail at Yellowstone, her eyes looked like melting ice. ,“She’s fine.” Milo felt his heart tighten and then release with a sharp pain.  He couldn’t tell her. ,. “But how are you, mom? Are you okay?”,“The best that can be expected I guess. I go to the hospital two or three times a day now.”,“Mom.” He followed her noise into the kitchen, and stood in the doorframe. “How are you, though? I know it hasn’t been sudden, we all knew it was coming, but it’s still. It’s still.” He had no word for it. He wiggled his toes in his dress shoes and felt younger than he had in years. ,. “It’s still your father.”,“I have something to show you.” She looked up at him with glassy eyes and marched quickly away from him, out of the kitchen and towards her study. “Remember how I told you I had that collection? A collection of fish jewelry since you got me that pin for Christmas?” He remembered being eight and finding that pin in a bureau drawer full of junk at the thrift store in his hometown. A large, gaudy metal pin of a flat fish, mouth agape and eyes jumbled, green luminescent scales dotting its body. Somehow it was perfect – the first gift he had ever bought anyone. ,“It’s gotten pretty big since I started. Can you believe it’s been ten years?” The year he left for college. The year his parents bought a misbehaved Labrador puppy, the year they took up skiing, and still his mother cried when he would call from school. ,Milo followed his mother’s voice into the study and then into a closet that housed water pipes and the old heater. ,“What do you think?” She faced him, watching for his expression.,Milo stared. Above a hissing radiator were three full walls of jewelry. Jewelry of different sizes, shapes, and colors, hanging from cloth netting that had been nailed to the drywall and draped along the pipes. A collection of time, of distance, of fish with wide eyes and mouths agape, dripping from the ceiling down to the floor.  Glittering, shimmering, catching his eyes with specks of light. ,“It’s beautiful.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/a_study_in_atlantic_salmon/,"

"When I catch sight of my stitches in periphery, I think they are hairs growing out of my wrist, like black wiry hairs growing out of a mole or on the jaw lines of women.  Then I think of Marie, whose name I thought was Murray at first because of the black hairs on her face and her body like a sack of Christmas toys.  She’s practically catatonic and the nurses have given up trying to make her speak.  I do not like to look at her.  Today’s goals: write in my journal, learn new coping skills, do not look at Marie. ,We have to set these goals every morning; it’s more difficult than it sounds.  We’re all of us sitting around in our sock feet looking sad and horse-faced, shuffling in socks because they have taken away our shoelaces, making our shoes useless.  I had to cut the drawstring from my sweatpants, so I’m sitting in our morning meeting, one hand useless because it’s holding up my pants, the other ugly with black hairs blossoming from the base of it, and I am running out of goals.  After three or four days, all of your goals are used up.  Goal: get out of this place where the trashcans are lined with paper bags instead of plastic.  The lucky ones are the people getting ECT.  They aren’t here in the morning. ,ECT is all the rage right now, in the same way that a good pair of boots or thick-framed glasses are.  What ECT signifies is electroconvulsive therapy, or People Getting Shocked in the Brain.  They use if for acute depression, which is being sad all of the time.  They also use it for mania, which is being crazy.  It didn’t work for Sylvia Plath, but people here think it will work for them and the Surgeon General says that it’s effective.  Nothing else has worked for these people, and they think the shocks will work, even though it makes them tired and dry-mouthed and causes memory loss.  One morning, a woman forgot what she was doing in this place after her shock treatment.  She completely forgot that she had chewed and swallowed the contents of a bottle of Prozac.  She is seventy-something, eating full bottles of Prozac.  Jesus. ,So it’s morning and we’ve eaten and we’ve had our break for cigarettes (goal: only smoke four cigarettes today,) which isn’t even fun anymore because my new medicine makes them not taste good, and the van is here to pick up the ones who get ECT, who don’t get to eat breakfast in case they throw up while they’re under, or something.  William who’s brilliant and who gets ECT two or three times a week has been here for almost a month, which is a long time to live without shoelaces, shaving your face in front of a nurse and a ward full of crazy people, drinking decaffeinated coffee.  He’s been here two weeks so today he’s getting shocked bilaterally, which means they put nodes on both sides of your head instead of just one.  This practice is apparently safe, but I am worried.  William is nice and we play Scrabble together and color in pictures like we are in kindergarten again, or maybe daycare.  It is kind of like daycare for adults except that instead of pacifiers, we get sedatives.  When William comes back, he does not know my name.  He remembers eventually, when I tell him.  ,There’s a doctor here too, shoelaceless, who never says much, he’s so tired from his ECT.  He’s handsome and went to a good school and wears round tortoise shell eyeglasses.  I watch him eat fast, like a hungry dog, like the nurses will take it away if he doesn’t hurry.  Maybe he is right. He sits next to me in art therapy when we make boxes to put our worries in.  I think I will fill mine with wishes.  Or sedatives.  Sarah sits in the corner mumbling and folding the corners of her box the wrong way.  When the therapist comes over to help, Sarah shuts up and looks scared.  I do not understand.,Lunch.  The woman to my left can tell me how many calories are in every item on her tray and mine.  I’m not sure I actually want to know.  She only eats the whites of her hardboiled eggs and puts vinegar on her salad instead of real dressing.  We half a dessert and I get all of the whipped cream.  Still, she isn’t as bad as my roommate who doesn’t get to come to the cafeteria with me and this woman and William and the rest of us.  She sits in the unit with the nurses and Sarah and the patients on Q15, which means they have to be checked on every fifteen minutes, which means they cannot leave the unit.  She eats Cheerios and fruit and not really anything else.  Later, I can tell whether or not she has thrown up in our bathroom. She doesn’t really look like someone who’d eat that way, with her buzzed hair and her construction boots, but I guess that doesn’t matter.  She gets to come outside after lunch and smoke cigarettes with us.  Goal: only smoke five cigarettes today.  At bedtime they give us our sedatives.  I put mine in my worry box and cannot fall asleep. ,The morning after sedative number eight goes in to the worry box, Sarah has a fit.  Since I have been here, I’ve played twelve games of scrabble, been to forty-eight groups, including music therapy where we pick a song from a list and get to listen to it (I choose Cat Stevens,) smoked one pack of cigarettes, and had zero cups of real coffee.  The handsome doctor has left.  He did not say goodbye.  We think he went AMA, which is against medical advice.  I miss him.  I would have liked to hug him goodbye.  Goodbye is the only time you get to touch another person here.  I miss touch. ,So Sarah is out in the hall cursing at the nurses and screaming that she is not paranoid.  I think maybe she had a bad meeting with her doctor.  I also think she is definitely paranoid.  She kicks and curses and thrashes around when they take her to her room but they get her quiet and I don’t see her all day.  Later than night, while I’m on the phone, they wheel her out strapped down to a stretcher.  She is smiling broadly with her cane in one hand and a potted plant in the other.  I wonder where she is going. ,The next morning I have a meeting with my doctor.  I’m not responding to treatment.  Why don’t we try something new?  I kick and scream.  I do not want to go.  It’s more of a requirement than a suggestion, though, so I’m skipping breakfast and climbing into the dark green van and bumping up the road to the hospital where they do the ECT.  A nurse in bright red scrubs pulls my hair back and puts gel on one of my temples.  On my right temple.  Lying on the table, shaking and waiting with a node on my temple, I hear the doctor count to three and the last thing I see in the back of my mind is footprints falling into the smoothest sand.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/psych-ward-memoirs/,"

"The unbridled happiness of Vampire Weekend’s self-titled debut album, released January 29, 2008, coincided with and perfectly complemented the second semester of my senior year of high school; I remember capering with my friends in their basements, half-shouting the lyrics in the spirit of frontman Ezra Koenig’s energetic (occasionally barking) voice, sipping from our preciously illicit first beers. The recent college graduates’ fittingly collegiate themes (in the track “Campus,” most obviously: “You’re walking cross the campus / Cruel professor / Studying romances”) reminded us how soon we were leaving home and how awesome it was going to be. The playful fusion of diverse genres—from Afro-pop to low-key indie, New Wave to ska—appealed to our Age-of-Mashups ideals of creativity (the summer of Girl Talk’s epically popular _Feed the Animals_ was obviously on its way). The Columbia University alums composed an album at once wholly, accessibly catchy and intelligently cultured (with references from Cape Cod to Darjeeling); knowing that my near-future University was little more than a 90-minute New Jersey Transit ride away from the Brooklyn-based quartet made my seventeen-year-old heart beat fast.,Roughly two years later—on January 12, 2010—they dropped _Contra_, their second album (although copies were floating around the Internet earlier in the month if you bothered to look), and, well, things have changed. Now that I’m in college, they’re over it; although the two album covers, as Koenig has said, “look like they both inhabit the same world,” the first features a chandelier at Columbia, the latter a 1983 photo of a bewildered blonde girl—clearly not someone from their graduating class. (Koenig has only disclosed that she is “now living in Malibu.”) _Contra_ has more color, more worldbeat, more oscillating synth-pop, and Koenig’s dynamic voice, often intentionally abrasive in _Vampire Weekend_, is now decidedly sweet with winsome falsettos (as in, for example, the catchy post-chorus hums of “White Sky,” or what seems like the entirety of “I Think Ur a Contra”). Taken together, the carefree marimbas of “Horchata,” the dizzying Auto-Tune of “California English,” and the M.I.A. sample in “Diplomat’s Son” attest not only to increased musical versatility but to their heightened adventurousness.  ,Perhaps the band’s side projects aided in this evolution. Koenig made a cameo last summer in “Warm Heart of Africa” by The Very Best, a collaboration between Malawi native Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit, on their album of the same name; his exuberance blended well with the sunny, totally lovable LP. And maybe he saw something he liked in Mwamwaya’s cosmopolitanism (_Warm Heart of Africa_, according to Pitchfork’s review, features “Chichewa, English, and other languages”) or in his unabashed juxtaposition of African melodies with Architecture in Helsinki samples. And Vampire Weekend keyboardist Rostam Batmangli, along with Wes Miles of Ra Ra Riot, released the album LP on July 7, 2009, as the band Discovery; catchier tracks such as “Osaka Loop Line” and “So Insane” show off Batmangli’s increasingly skillful mastery of artificial sounds and genre bending. In retrospect, it’s easy to see what the band was learning.,But in their maturation from smirking college kids asking, “Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?” in the track, uh, “Oxford Comma” to singing about horchata, balaclavas, and Masada (and in the concomitant transition from obscurity to occupying the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart), some things have stayed the same: most notably, the opposition. Haters hated on their cultural missteps and on their not-funny wardrobes of preppy collared shirts and cardigans, sneakers and boat shoes (all the while singing about having “Spilled kefir / On your keffiyah”); the irony is easily missed or dismissed. But, most objectionable, perhaps, is the seeming hypocrisy of one of their favorite themes: denouncing elitism and questioning one’s (upper middle) class. The first album certainly considers the idea in “Oxford Comma,” when Koenig mocks someone insecure about status: “Why would you lie about how much coal you have? / Why would you lie about something dumb like that?” But _Contra_ refers to wealth almost constantly: “California English” says, “Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club;” in “Taxi Cab,” Koenig sings, “I pretended I was horrified / By the uniform clothes outside / Of the courtyard gate;” the track “Diplomat’s Son” is about, well, a diplomat’s son. The bombardment of allusions to wealth suggest a mockery of it; Koenig makes this explicit in “I Think Ur a Contra,” when he bemoans a love who “wanted good schools / And friends with pools” but he “just wanted you.”,But there is something off-putting about a bunch of upper middle class twentysomethings—Ivy League graduates, no less—interrogating social hierarchies. Their songs are so well composed, their synthesizer so well executed that it’s questionable if they could actually handle the disruption to social ordering their lyrics request. Juliane Shepherd, writing for _the Village Voice_, once likened them to the “ridiculous soap opera _Gossip Girl_, a trashy show whose very existence underscores issues of race and class,” claiming that “Vampire Weekend does the same, but sans the performative self-awareness.” And it’s true: Koenig sings about money in his carefree manner to the band’s cheery indietronica instrumentation.,It’s precisely this carefree manner, however, that redeems them. Vampire Weekend asks its listeners to lighten up: to care less about money, for one, but also to blend familiar categories of music, to swallow their obnoxiously ironic preppiness, and to embrace their effervescence. They know what they’re doing; their discussion of wealth uses flags so red (Koenig mentions “docking the yacht in such low waters” in final track “Giant”) that it’s insulting to assume they aren’t making a big joke. The band’s growth from _Vampire Weekend_ to _Contra_, which expands the money theme while tightening their musical technique, builds precisely upon what critics hated; they understand the incongruity of having an upper middle class status and mocking it. Reacting to music rejecting uptightness with more uptightness, then, seems much sillier than mentioning horchata and Masada in the same song or even wearing a keffiyah.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/lighten-contra/,"

"A week and a day after I saw Dan Deacon play his new DVD, ,, at Bard College, I saw him buying a camera at B&H in Manhattan. B&H is probably what the Nazis feared the planet would look like by now: an electronics store run and mostly staffed by Orthodox Jews, every item carried from the shelf to the salesman to the register by conveyor belts, each one tricked out with neon blue trim. (The conveyor belts, besides their general air of Future, would have been necessary to switch your item with a lesser-quality one.) While I waited for my friend, I thought of what my run-in with Deacon would be like after he made his purchase. ,Him: Thanks, I love people who love my show! Want to come make papier-mâché dragon costumes and fight in them to entertain Chinese gamblers? ,Me: Of course! ,Him: Don’t forget to bring your tape recorder and your desperate but embarrassing desire to be this generation’s clear-thinking Hunter S. Thompson. ,Me: Sure thing! ,Him: And some seventeen-year-old girls who’ll still be impressed by an apartment in Williamsburg. ,I waited a while longer, but my friend made his purchase and we left before I got a chance.,It’s unfortunate that Dan Deacon’s moment has likely passed, slipping around the wrong side of the hype cycle into backlash, because the “Ultimate Reality” tour is clearly his consummation. Besides a whole new set of his enthusiastically kitschy electronic music, he has added two live drummers, and, most importantly, video art produced by Jimmy Joe Roche. It’s hard to explain the intensity of the experience he’s put together (though YouTube helps). The music is incredible—easily better than anything else he’s ever done—but if you’ve listened to Dan Deacon for more than two dozen hours in your life, you’ll probably tire of it in isolation. He hasn’t gotten any new synthesizers or even chord changes; it feels mostly like ,would have with more care and without his dorky crystal meth cat singing.,But then there’s the video. Roche’s specialty is drenching everything in neon colors, flipping the images at the middle of the screen, and rendering YouTube commenters speechless beyond “dude I feel like I’m trippin face.” For ,, he’s chosen Arnold Schwarzenegger as his muse. The video opens with Schwarzenegger circa ,, half-naked and wielding a sword, his physique less godly than leathery and squat (one might say choadish) beneath a bright purple sky. It meanders through the rest of Arnold’s catalog from there—Arnold with half a robot face from ,, Arnold getting his head crushed in ,, a pregnant and cross-dressing Arnold prancing around in a circle dance from ,.,Each time Deacon’s music rises to climax, the clips speed and blur until they become an unsettling orgasm of senselessness—nuclear explosions and flaming helicopters and Arnold’s bleeding abs and was that an ejaculating penis? There’s something intimately horrifying about the whole thing—as if we were watching the broke Schwarzenegger of an alternate reality get fucked up on PCP and max out with free weights as he watches one of his late-career porn tapes. The underlying sense of menace, not just from the violent imagery but also from a bizarre, nearly momentum-killing interlude, in which a ,-cum-Powerpoint scroll melds the plots of various movies (with an awkwardly funny/unfunny style; Schwarzenegger’s mission includes saving a boy who has been severely wounded by his abusive father), would have kept me on edge the entire time—except that it didn’t.,And that’s the trick Dan Deacon has discovered, or at least mastered, the reason he seems so entirely of the moment (in that he could not have come at any other time, and in that he is surely going to be surpassed): spectacle is a license to abandon meaning, and in this ahistorical, narrative-free age irony is the easiest game around. This is what made his show more than a show—it seemed a cathedral of sensationalist hedonism, a newly maximalist approach to communal experience. Deacon has observed the creeping growth of other media into the concert experience, and he obviously intends to push it towards its logical conclusion: the stimulation of every sense at once, in as big of a room with as many people as possible.,There’s still Schwarzenegger to account for, however. If Roche and Deacon wanted to put on the greatest light show ever, they could have done that. Why the relentless cultural referencing? There is probably no answer, but if there is, it is that culture has disintegrated so rapidly into its tiny and absurd constituent parts that one can intellectually mimic the physical effect of spectacle by throwing as many bizarre concepts at the viewer as one can. Any order but “in order,” and any reference but one that fits into a narrative we can still grasp: this is the way to displace the viewer from himself long enough that you can get him to dance for his life. What better choice than Schwarzenegger and his jump from pathetic masculine posturing to genuinely good governance, if one’s goal is to demonstrate our faltering demand that anything make sense?,It wouldn’t quite be correct to call ,art, even when that term includes bad art, because art at least ought to have some sort of unified being. Deacon’s extravaganzas have no central goal beyond his vaguely sketched-out attempts to manifest “future shock,” the phenomenon we are all supposedly experiencing as technology accelerates cultural development, leaving us able to feel at home in our own culture only momentarily. But future shock promises the death of art, and threatens to make art that doesn’t engage with or criticize, but rather embodies this temptation to succumb, in this case with a shit-eating grin and some hi-larious monologues about smoking weed. If Deacon represents the recognition of and assent to this kind of spectacular meaninglessness, he certainly doesn’t represent its triumph. That will come with Shia LeBeouf’s $200 million virtual-reality tour (“LaBeouf!”) sponsored by Microsoft-MGM-BMG., In the ,, Guy Debord writes that “the spectacle … presents itself as a means of unification.” This unification is not that of conventional art, however; it bears no meaningful relation to the concepts of our own world that art ought to cohere and enhance for us. “The images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream in which the unity of that life can no longer be recovered.” When the video and music simultaneously climaxed, cramming in as many images as would fit into a frame and as many frames as would fit into a second, it wasn’t hard to feel what Debord meant. As the maturation of media continues and the viewer’s experience of it grows more intense, the notion that there is anything to be taken away beyond the visceral sensationalism of it all vanishes.,I am perhaps too easily drawn into Debordian rapturous horror, taking ,‘s titular claim on its face, credulously willing to agree that this truly is the final reality, Debord’s “pseudoreality”—the last pitch into a relentless churn of decontextualization glossed into something tolerable by spectacle. It’s virtually certain that Debord would have thought so, anyway. But maybe we shouldn’t be listening to an alcoholic that shot himself in the heart more than a decade ago, never even bothered to define his own movement, and held that to understand his message one should navigate through one foreign city with the map of another one. ,The day after the show, rumors began spreading that someone on campus had had sex with Deacon, or one of the drummers, or both at once. Sex with Dan Deacon? I’ll give the man credit, he claims to have lost weight, but he still has the look of grown gym class-cutter wearing shut-in sweatpants. One of his songs is titled “Shit Slowly Applied to Cock Parts.” I know cocaine can work miracles, but I’m skeptical his sex acts are anything but an extension of his performances: a little brief even with the unfunny interludes.,A week after the show, my girlfriend and I bumped into the girl who supposedly had the threesome in the Strand. She was wearing Johnny Depp glasses (or are they American Apparel glasses now, like everything else hipper than an IFC short?), and we asked her what she was up to in the city. “Oh, just partying with Dan Deacon,” she said, by way of confirmation. There really was a papier- mâché dragon costume fight. She’s living the dream, my girlfriend’s smirk remarked, just like the rest of us.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/sittin_pretty_in_wham_city/,"

"I hate vaginas. I always have and always will. They’re dank and cavernous and horrible, and I feel bad for every man or woman who has to venture down there without a bulwark between him and that juicy, pungent vag-spunk. So, maybe it wasn’t the best idea for me to go ,, directed by Sarah Outhwaite. ,Last Friday, having reluctantly promised a friend to attend her performance, I sat down in the back row of the Frist Theatre with Justine Chaney, primed for heckling and power lesbians. As a ,virgin and self-professed vagina-hater, I felt a vaguely dull ache in my abdomen as Francesca Butler and Nienke Boer walked out onto the stage, straight hair, black slacks, and high pumps all in place. Cue gesticulation, melodrama, and the over-enunciation of one repeated word: VUH-JAI-NUH. VUH. JAAAAAAAAAAI. NUH. Justine held my hair back as spicy tuna spewed forth from deep within my churning stomach. I need not elaborate on the appropriateness of the multitude of lines throughout the monologues referencing the fishy smell (and taste) of female genitalia. How novel, guys.,The first piece, Kaitlyn Hamilton’s rendition of “Hair,” was probably not the best way to entice me into staying longer. (That my friend’s monologue was the second to last performance of the night was a fact I lamented loudly when handed the program.) The vagina, I mean woman, began her diatribe, I mean monologue, about her ex-husband, who forces her to shave her vagina, and then at her psychiatrist’s suggestion, shaves her vagina ,her, what then becomes her “naked puffy vagina”. I almost bolted. (Justine seemed vaguely intrigued.) The next piece, “The Flood,” was absolutely no better. A flood coming from Elizabeth Schwall’s vagina? And it smells like sour milk? And there are pigeons, shrimp cocktail, and fish involved? I wretched once more in Justine’s lap.,All right, I hate vaginas. We get it. But heartwarmingly, I was surprised by how the sometimes dubious acting of the vagina-loving ladies still made me laugh. “The Vagina Workshop” features the ensemble being instructed by a woman who “believes in vaginas” on how to examine their lady parts with hand mirrors. Chloe Hall, cast as a woman in the workshop completely mystified by her vagina, searching endlessly for the ever-evasive clitoris, learns to give herself pleasure right before the audience’s very eyes. All ends well, in an earth-shaking, ground-breaking, planet-moving, Pluto-obliterating orgasm, and then Hall accepts herself. I will admit, realizing the gravity of the situation—that I was sitting in a dark room filled with middle-aged gender studies professors and poetry-writing boyfriends learning about my very own genitalia—made me start to laugh. Now if only Hall had used her hand.,The next piece started with, “This is how I came to love my vagina.” I thought to myself, “Okay, Thu. If you’re going to sit through another hour of this, you should put your penis down for a second and try to get in touch with your vagina. Or maybe you can just laugh really hard”. The monologue, performed by Jessica Taylor, is about a woman whose lover Bob refuses to have sex with her unless she allows him to get a really good look at her cootch. This one really hits home. Everyone has been victim to this situation: Meet boring stranger who thinks that the key to great unpredictable sex is frequently changing between missionary and girl-on-top. Decide to engage in sexual intercourse with said boring stranger, because while nothing good can come of it, the worst that can happen is an accidental orgasm. Get down only to realize the stranger has a completely weird-o fetish, i.e., he will not take part in any vanilla boning without first thoroughly examining the object of his bone. Regardless of the fact that the piece turned out to be about Taylor discovering the beauty of her vagina (gee, really?), realizing this situation could easily have been reported to me by a friend on a Sunday morning brought an unexpected chuckle to my bile-filled throat. Good job, ,!,Kate Miller’s rendition of “My Angry Vagina”, though at times overacted, had some entertaining ditties about going to the gyno, but it was Nadia Talel’s “My Vagina Was My Village” that opened me up, so to speak. Talel’s performance depicting a Bosnian woman raped and tortured by a band of soldiers was at its best moments haunting. My penis shriveled just a little bit. This applies equally for Kay Zhang’s “Say It,” about an ambiguously Asian woman demanding an apology from the Japanese government for forcing her into sexual slavery as a young girl. Despite her ambiguous accent, Zhang’s forceful voice, filled with the bitterest betrayal and indignation, resonated in the small theater. Between the two pieces squeezing my very little heart was Andrea Lee’s beautifully acted “The Little Coochi Snorcher That Could”. I was completely convinced I was watching a young girl who gets punched at seven years old, then gets raped by her father’s best friend (who is then shot and killed by her father before her eyes) at age ten, and finally receives her sexual instruction from a twenty-four-year-old lesbian at the age of sixteen. Lee’s smooth transition from humor to tragedy to sexual transformation impressed even my vagina-skeptical soul. Let us digress for a moment to assuage Justine’s ambivalent feelings about this piece: ,And we resume.,And then. It happened. Lea Steinacker. If you are reading this, this is a solicitation. We want you. Not, like, for anything. We just ,you. Steinacker’s performance as a lesbian dominatrix transcended the dubious acting and fishy smells prevalent throughout the rest of ,. Only two words come to mind: Smoking. Hot. Oh, and moaning. There was a whole lot of moaning. (This, if anything, really made my penis not shrink.) Steinacker, portraying a powerful sexual being restrained by her silent heterosexual encounters, turns to the other side when she realizes the beauty of making women moan. The rest of the monologue follows as her demonstration of nearly two-dozen different types of moans, climaxing in a triple orgasm and followed by her exhausted collapse face-forward, onto the floor. Stick a fork in me, I was done. I was a born-again vagina warrior.,Poignant yet slightly squishy “I Was There in the Room” followed, featuring Peale Iglehart and Alanna Gregory, and then the finale by the entire cast. And then some words about actual causes that people actually care about, namely New Orleans and how it is the vagina of America (yes, we tried to Verbatim it), and how we need to be more aware about the plight of the world. Vagina, vagina, vagina. I have to give this year’s cast of ,an A for vagina-effort and its vaginability to make me rethink the world’s vaginosity. And actually nothing empowers me more than learning that, apparently, the clitoris has 8,000 nerve fibers, twice the number found on the penis. AWESOME.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/notorious_eve/,"

"The Writer’s Strike is over! Listen closely and you can hear the clicks of the computers as writers across America happily click away. All is good in the world, except for all of that bad that’s still in there too. Writers for the ,strode into the meeting room with an enthusiastic vigor that has not been seen since 1988, when the Writer’s Guild of America ended its last strike.,After a long battle between production companies and the writers who write for them, the WGA has finally voted to end the strike that lasted for over three months and caused much grief in and outside the WGA itself. Although voting on the new writer’s contract has not yet taken place, this is a huge step. Now, the gates of television can once again pour open like tea being poured into a saucer as shows prepare to air new episodes as quickly as possible in the upcoming weeks. If you are addicted to shows like ,, then congratulations—you can now once again lose a sense of time as you retreat to your sad, sad televisions and become engrossed in other people’s lives instead of your own. Also, on a more serious note, it’s time to celebrate for real! , and , are back! The strike began when the WGA decided that they weren’t getting adequate compensation and rights in the new age of media. The Internet is becoming an increasingly popular way for people to watch TV shows and movies, and production companies were originally unwilling to give writers any residuals from the Internet until they had conducted further studies on the direction that the Internet is going in terms of media viewing.,In a letter to all the WGA writers, the presidents of the WGA said, “An ongoing struggle against seven, multinational media conglomerates, no matter how successful, is exhausting, taking an enormous personal toll on our members and countless others. As such, we believe that continuing to strike now will not bring sufficient gains to outweigh the personal risks and that the time has come to accept this contract and settle the strike.”,The new contract states, among other things, that writers will receive compensation for programs and movies shown on the Internet. The amount of compensation differs depending on different things, such as whether the viewer pays for the show or movie, or not. It also addresses specific kinds of Internet viewing. For example, the contract states that with shows that networks stream online, after the Initial Streaming Window (a period of 17 days after or during the first airing of an episode, or 24 days, if the show is a one-off television show, a Movie of the Week, or in its first season), network prime time writers will now be entitled to residuals of 3% or more. The contract also addresses the question of writers receiving residuals both if people download shows and movies temporarily, or buy them by downloading them permanently.,To get to this point in negotiations did not come with little sacrifice. Some of the losses may seem more tangible than the symbolic gains that writers have now earned. As the Hollywood Reporter says, “While the writers gained much—respect and a stake in the future, for starters—they also collectively lost millions they will never recoup.” Some studios have terminated contracts with writers in response to the strike, and are instead airing more reality shows, which they say they will continue to air in the upcoming season.,However, the writers now have their foot in the door, and it’s a big door—it’s the door to the giant’s giant mansion that is The Future. Although many people are aware that this is only the beginning of a much longer battle between writers (and directors and actors) and studios, it is still an important first step in acknowledging the fact that new times call for new negotiations. In a letter from the writers of ,to its fans, they said that the three month struggle was “worth it, because writers have managed to win a share of the future of the industry.” Many writers, although relieved to be working again, also emphasized how important it was that they had successfully banded together to stand up against the bigger players in Hollywood. This seems to be another positive result of the strike. Some writers acknowledged the increased feelings of unity between writers within the Guild as they worked together by not working at all. The Internet—that wily animal who created all these problems in the first place—has been a useful way for members of the WGA to communicate with each other before and after the strike ended. Following the letter from the presidents of the WGA online is a lengthy debate between writers and onlookers alike about the pros and cons of the new contract. Many asked for clarifications about some of the more obscure points in the contract, others expressed their relief that some agreement had finally been reached, and others still expressed their feelings of dissatisfaction with the new terms. Such passion has not been seen on the Internet since everyday on Juicycampus.com. It is a fact that it is still unclear whether these negotiations will settle any immediate concerns that writers have. In fact, from here it seems to be more of a mutual waiting game than anything else. No one can predict where the Internet is going, and until Hollywood can figure out a way to get viewers to watch their shows under their terms, no one can easily tell the best way to handle it yet.,Streaming with embedded commercials seems to currently be their best bet, but these commercials at this point do not gather incredibly large amounts of money compared to other forms of advertising. And so, we wait.,The Screen Actor’s Guild has a three-year contract due to expire on June 30. Some believe that without any large outside pressures creating deadlines—as the upcoming Oscars undoubtedly did—this expiration could cause a re-struggle. There are no awards shows in the summer.,But for now, do not fear; writers are back and happy to be back. This was instantly clear when members of the , finally rejoined each other with loud shouts of joy and laughter as they chatted about all the places they had been to and seen over the hiatus. Almost immediately writers in the room began to throw together brilliant jokes and ideas for new movies and television shows that had just been waiting to be written over the three-month break. “What about A Beautiful Mind Two: John Nash Tackles Princeton University?” one writer cheerfully pitched to the rest of the writers. “He can handle cryptography, sure, but can he handle The Street on a Saturday night?” One writer replied quickly, “I’m down, but only if we don’t need to renegotiate any Internet compensation…” There was a brief silence in the room as everyone turned to look at him. “Just kidding—we’re back, baby!” he exclaimed, and the rest of the room burst into uproarious laughter.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/igossip_girli_returns/,"

"The emergence of Lady Gaga’s alien-like back-up dancers—bedecked in all-white outfits of synthetic leotard, tall spiked crown, and go-go boots—from their perfect row of white coffins in an entirely white room announces from the outset that “Bad Romance” is going to be a music video of insanity. As the coffins crack open their angular arms extend outward and, more importantly, their twitching fingers—a gesture revisited by a pink-haired, bug-eyed Gaga rapping her own digits twitchingly against the outer rim of her waterless tub. There are sexy scenes, sure: she crawls in rhinestone-studded lingerie to her captor; later, she writhes with her dancers in lacy red lingerie on the ground. But for the most part, the sexiness of the video is assumed, secondary to the singer’s utter weirdness; her clothes are form-fitting and scanty, but more importantly, they’re _different_. Throughout the video her outfit changes from an angular, metallic mini-dress with glasses made of spiraling razor blades to a sheer dress with pasties over her nipples to white undergarments under a sweeping polar bear coat, the train of which culminates in the polar bear’s head. Lady Gaga announces from beneath her futuristic, unconventional garb that she is not another Taylor Swift, not another Miley Cyrus: she’s a pop star all of her own, crazy-clothed or not.,But the Gaga religion (even if not everyone has converted, almost everyone will acknowledge it exists) owes more than a little of its existence to the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen. The metallic mini-dress from the opening scene is McQueen’s; so are her “Dragon Heels”—twisty platform heels with dragon-esque spikes coiling down the stilettos, appearing in several colors throughout the video. And as she fittingly sings, “Walk, walk, fashion baby,” she dons a sparkling greenish-gold dress with an exaggeratedly bulbous skirt complete with matching leggings (all McQueen’s), now infamous foot-tall heels resembling giant lobster claws (McQueen’s—often referred to as “McQueenadillos”), and hair styled in two horizontal slabs, for lack of a better word (McQueen’s—variants of which featured prominently in his 2009 “Plato’s Atlantis” collection). The singer’s aesthetic audacity fit perfectly with the designer’s creative couture; it is unsurprising, then, that “Bad Romance” actually debuted at the “Plato’s Atlantis” runway show.,The fashion legacy of McQueen, who took his own life last Thursday, February 11, is filled with such drama—most evidently, in his catwalk shows. His 1995 show entitled “Highland Rape” featured tattered dresses and tampon strings dangling from skirts; though some called him misogynistic, he claimed to be making a metaphor for Britain’s “rape” of Scotland. In 2000 his models, heads wrapped in hospital bandage, strutted around a cell from a psychiatric hospital wearing such pieces as an enormous headdress composed of a stuffed birds bouquet (complete with a skirt made of cascading gray feathers) and a shift dress with a torso- sized toy castle resting on its shoulder. The show concluded with a tableau of a corpulent woman wearing only a face mask and breathing tube, reclining beneath a sea of moths. And, inspired by Darwinian evolution, his 2009 show featured a video of model Raquel Zimmermann covered in snakes and models dressed in digitally-enhanced reptile prints, their feet lost in aforementioned McQueenadillos. Their hairstyles were usually two large tufts, extending upwards like horns or erect animal ears; their faces were extraordinarily nude. with even eyebrows covered in pale makeup. The theatrics of his shows added another dimension to his fashion: his work extended beyond the individual pieces, bold as they may be, to the larger performance art they represented.,But fundamental to his high-octane shows were the exceptionally well-made clothing pieces they flaunt. He began his fashion career humbly as an apprentice on the famed Savile Row, a London street known for its traditional men’s tailoring; the skills he developed would help him create his signature look of impeccable craftsmanship. Beneath the elaborate feather headdresses of his 2006 collection, for example, which sprouted in outlandish directions from their models’ flyaway hair, were outfits of remarkable structure and detail: as in a tweed skirt suit with enormous pockets and ruffles cascading from the lapels, belted flatteringly at the waist; or a high-waisted tartan pantsuit with a matching cropped jacket dotted with large gold buttons on both sides; or a long-sleeved white dress, fitted throughout the body until, below the hips, it transformed into tiers of soft ruffles. (He paired this final dress with a translucent veil wound around white antlers, reiterating his astounding ability to pair artistic innovation with material quality.) Examining his current “womenswear” collection online reveals the same expertise of technique: the clothes and shoes are geometry-heavy with oblique zippers and patterns of mazes; they’re often garishly colored but, of course, carefully fitted.,His fusion of outrageous theatrics with precise style was symptomatic of his technological savvy. In 2006, he stunned a Paris audience with a holographic image of Kate Moss, his close friend and one of the world’s most famous models, dancing in a glass pyramid, surrounded by a billowing white gown; the beautiful, almost supernatural spectacle—now immortalized on YouTube—involved an optical device called “Pepper’s Ghost.” McQueen created the impressively bright and detailed patterns of the “Plato’s Atlantis” collection’s aforementioned reptile prints with digital enhancement techniques, and he live-streamed the runway show, which featured robotic cameras running back and forth along an iridescent runway, on the Internet. Even before his major contributions to the Haus of Gaga, furthermore, he projected his art through many media—designing, for instance, the album cover of Icelandic singer Björk’s 1997 release _Homogenic_. The musician—face painted geisha white with falsely-pursed lips, hair coiled in two giant, symmetric buns (perhaps a prototype of the slabs Gaga would later sport)—is wrapped in a futuristic kimono-style dress, fingers with menacing silver claws crossed in front of her, neck covered by a stack of gold rings. (McQueen also directed the loopy music video accompanying _Homogenic_’s track “Alarm Call.”),But his influence on the fashion world was even more far-reaching. Models in his early shows sported “bumsters,” pants so hip-slung they revealed the upper curvature of their, uh, bums; the look spread and effectively revived the past decade or two’s trend of (albeit less-daring than McQueen’s) low-rise pants. And his iconic skull-patterned scarf (and corresponding skull clutch bag) is an item often coveted and counterfeited.,His legacy, then, in combining imaginative shows with thoughtfully constructed clothes, flashy technology with smart wearability, is creativity in a world where (almost) everything has already been done. His outrageous tactics—as in the breathing mask tableau from 2000, or his 1999 selection of double amputee Aimee Mullens as a model, sent down the runway in wooden legs—challenged observers and buyers to rethink beauty and beautiful art. At the same time, his adherence to conservative tailoring and his mastery of form—which made (many of) his pieces both wearable and flattering—insisted upon the importance of making clothes well, of understanding the angles of the human body. His unyielding ability to deliver on the unexpected (which, from him, was expected) gave us Lady Gaga, a rising (or risen) star known as much for her avant-garde fashion as for her catchy pop singles; she was his “unofficial muse,” wearing, to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, a terrifying red McQueen dress that tightly covered her entire face, accessorized with a matching red crown. His life ended at the peak of his career, and both the McQueen line and the fashion world as a whole are struggling with the question of who can match and further his remarkable spirit. It’s probably not possible.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/lady-and-mcqueen/,"

"JuicyCampus, an anonymous forum devoted to gossip and rumor, has taken off in recent weeks on college campuses across the nation, and represents what is perhaps the final stage of the digitization of student identity. Where before individuals controlled the level of disclosure contained in and the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of their online façades, now anyone may say anything about anyone. In a sense this was always true on the Internet, but in the same way that Facebook popularized and systematized discourse between known or quasi-known persons, JuicyCampus operates without reference to providers or receivers. There is only information, be it good or bad, true or false.,Structuring identities within broader communities is never a simple task, but with the aid of the Internet this generation has tried to make it so. Facebook developed as a means of boiling down the individual into a system of manageable and malleable parts such as interests, tastes, communications, and visual snapshots. Once enough meta-representations of individuals formed, they began to join together first within campuses, then in groups, and finally in networks sharing at times no greater common denominator than nationality. Within these groups, a discourse of pokes, wall posts, and tags serves as a simulacrum for communication, and “friendships” develop between online identities where none exist in ‘first life.’,Just as Facebook allows the user to paint himself as he likes, JuicyCampus allows users to paint anyone however they like. Perhaps a reaction to the constructive power of Facebook, JuicyCampus users devote their energies to the deconstruction of contrived personalities. Gossip has always worked this way, but in the past the gossiper had to know when and with whom to hold his tongue, lest he be branded a libeler.,Paradoxically, without the elements of risk and selectivity of audience, gossip is at once empowered as information, but robbed of all currency as power. Certainly JuicyCampus is a hot item now, but what are its prospects? When every appetite for random, pointless, and unverifiable licentiousness has been satiated, once we are all incriminated, who will want to read it?,Rob Madole talked to JuicyCampus creator Matt Ivester to try to get to the bottom of this new forum of discourse and to see plausible defenses for what many perceive to be a total waste of time. ,–John Nelson,Nassau Weekly: ,Matt Ivester: (Pause). So how did we think about this?,NW:,MI: I guess…I was trying to think of business ideas, and it occurred to me that some of my best stories, that I love recounting with my friends, and some of my most hilarious stories, came from college. And I was hanging out with my friends and recounting some of the ridiculous things we used to do, and the fun times we had, and I was thinking, everybody has these stories. On every college campus, every group of friends has these hilarious things that are going on every day, and so why not create a place where all that can be shared, because I didn’t see anything like that on the Internet.,NW:,MI: uh…you know, it would be, I think, a really interesting sociological study if some sociology professor…I think they could teach a whole class about JuicyCampus, honestly.  But no, I double-majored in Economics and Computer Science.,NW:,MI: Duke.,NW:,MI: It just went online a few months ago. It actually launched on seven campuses, October 24th, 2007.,NW:,MI: Yeah, so, we tested it out on seven campuses, just to see if this was going to be a thing that people even cared anything about or anybody’s going to be interested in, and what we found, after doing our test on seven campuses, was that there was tremendous demand for this kind of website, and it grew much more quickly than we ever expected. So, kind of knowing that we had this proof-of-concept already done, we decided to invest further and open it up to 50 more campuses, and, that was about a month ago.  That was when Princeton was added.,NW:,MI:  Yeah, it sure is. (Chuckles). Yeah. This is what I do all day, every day.,NW:,MI: L.A. (Pause). L.A.,NW:,MI:  Well, they can’t post anything, I mean, it’s all set to our terms and conditions, which are fairly extensive, but it is an unmoderated site, so we’ll delete spam if it comes to our attention, but it’s very rare that we delete a post.  We don’t want to be in the censorship business, and frankly, with thousands and thousands of posts a day, it’s just not feasible.,NW:,MI: We’ve got a few people working for us, and we’ve got a whole technical team building out the site…yeah, we’ve had to, actually had to expand, get an office, all of that.,NW:,MI:  You know, we get that question a lot, and everybody likes to compare it to Facebook, which, first of all, I take as a huge compliment because they’ve been wildly successful.  But we’re really not trying to be the next Facebook.  Facebook is what it is, and they’ve got a great product.  What we’re trying to do is be different, so, we’re not going to be incorporating a social networking aspect.  We like the anonymous thing, and that kind of differentiates that.,NW:,MI:  Um, well, I mean, obviously, our core product is gossip.  But, in the future, I think we want to kind of expand the content that is on the site and provide more ways for users to interact.  I prefer not to go into the specifics of it, for business reasons.  But we’re definitely looking at expanding it very aggressively over the next six months.,NW:,MI: This is certainly my most successful one, yeah.  This is kind of the first big one.,NW:,MI: Well, now, to get it started, it was just a very small group of investors, and then, we’ve gotten a lot of interest since it’s kind of shown itself to be a really viable, valuable website.  We’ve had a lot of interest from investors and we’re pursuing all of that.  So, you know, it’s totally privately funded by a small group of investors right now.,NW:,MI: You know, I don’t think we’re at that point yet. We launched three, four months ago, I guess, so, we’ve seen tremendous growth, and we haven’t really had a chance to catch our breath and talk with any bigger companies.,NW:,MI: I think our options are open. We are, we’re talking with investors, and there’s certainly people out there who are interested in putting money into the company, um, but certainly, if the right oppurtunity came about to talk to a bigger company about JuicyCampus, we’d consider it.,NW:,MI: I mean, the fact that you bring up the question means there must be some concern out there, but JuicyCampus doesn’t provide legal advice; we’re not in a position to do that—that’s what law firms are for.  We have, um, (pause), we have, basically, immunity as a platform provider under, I believe it’s section 230…of some congressional thing.  I leave that to our lawyers (laughs).  But, basically, as an interactive platform provider, we can’t be held liable as though we were the speaker of the content.  So we haven’t really had very many legal concerns at all, ’cause all of the posts on JuicyCampus are user-generated. (Pause). And the reason Congress has done that is to protect sites, you know, I mean just because someone posts something malicious on Facebook or Myspace or something else doesn’t mean they should be held liable, I mean, so, it’s a law that makes sense.,NW:,MI: Um, well, yeah, I think if you go on and read the post for each different school, there’s a little bit of a different feel and a different taste, which totally makes sense, because every college community has their [sic] own feel.  So, I certainly have noticed that, and I guess I’m not surprised by it though.,NW:,MI:  You know, to be honest, we don’t really read posts.  We’ve been so busy working on new features, and getting users to the site that we haven’t really done a real analysis of small schools versus big schools, or different kinds of content, or anything like that.,NW:,MI: Um, well you know, we leave it to our users to create the content that most interests them, so, um, so, I try to withold judgment.,NW:,MI:  Would we have any response?  I mean, I think we’d certainly be surprised, if a school was [sic] to ban, you know, a free speech website.  You know…I guess we’d be very surprised, would be our response.,NW:,MI: We would consider our legal options, but I’m not sure what those would be, or anything.  It hasn’t happened, so I guess we’ll cross that bridge if we have to.,NW:,MI: Um, I’ll tell you, the thing that we keep working on is the site speed.  I don’t know if you’ve been on it recently, but we’re growing so quickly, our server can’t keep up with the tremendous growth that we’ve seen, so that’s been our number one priority…But aside from that, users can look forward to, and we’re very close to rolling these out actually, things like e-mail alerts, so you can be notified if there’s a new reply to a post that you’re interested in, or, we’d like to add a sort option, so that you can see latest replies instead of just the latest posts.  Other things kind of like that…So I think that’ll be good.,NW:,MI: Yeah, no problem.  And if there’s anything else we can do, just give us a call.,–,[This piece has been edited for content and clarity. --,.]",http://www.nassauweekly.com/is_the_juice_worth_the_squeeze/,"

"On March 25, Jason Bell—Columbia University freshman, gastronome-in-training, and editor of the _Columbia Spectator_’s “Food & Drink” section—published a scathing review of Colicchio & Sons, the newest Tom Colicchio (of Gramercy Tavern and _Top Chef_ judging fame) eatery. Although _The New York Times_ had, a week before, awarded the restaurant an “excellent” three stars, Bell had choice criticisms for both the atmosphere (“Hovering waiters serve…a simultaneously over- and underdressed crowd seemingly confused about whether this is a fi ne dining restaurant gesturing at casualness or a casual bistro playing dress-up”) and for the food (“overpriced, grotesque,” “laughably predictable,” “a textural disaster”)—most notably, the morels (“Colicchio’s morels only got a brief rinse in the kitchen, leaving crunchy particles lurking to surprise unsuspecting diners”) and the dessert (“Colicchio would be better off slapping down an Eggo waffl e and throwing in the towel”). Between then and now, _New York Magazine_’s “Grub Street” picked up on his review, Tom Colicchio responded with an _argumentum ad hominem_ (via Twitter, no less), and the almost-scandal received attention from national media such as IvyGate, _The Huffington Post_, and, most notably, the _Nassau Weekly_.,Below is the interview I scored with Bell (full disclosure: we went to the same high school, and I scored said exclusive interview by sending him an instant message); even though it occurred over the phone, I could almost picture the serious but thoughtful face, freckled and bespectacled, that recently hated (and hated on) Colicchio’s “grotesque” dishes.,_Nassau Weekly_: [In your review,] you mentioned sampling a variety of things— such as chorizo, pork belly, octopus, bacon, gnocchi—how did you manage to try everything? How much of each item could you really eat?,Jason Bell: The time that I went, I didn’t try all of those items. I ordered off of the _prix fixe_ menu. In the article I think that I comment on the conceptual direction of a couple of different dishes—for instance, I didn’t specifically try the dish with the octopus, the chorizo, that stuff…At the time that I went it was a three-course _prix fixe_, and…I know that it’s gone back to _a la carte_ because he switched it back right after Sam Sifton reviewed it [for _The New York Times_].,NW: Speaking of the dish with the chorizo, pork belly, and octopus, what made it, as your review called it, “laughably predictable?”,JB: Well, when you think about the different types of proteins that have become really popular—especially on the New York food scene in the past couple of years—pork belly is defi nitely at the very top of the list. Probably fi ve years ago if you walked into the average restaurant in Brooklyn or, you know, kind of a small farm-to-table restaurant in Manhattan, you would never see pork belly. But it’s really skyrocketed in popularity. And then, similarly, chorizo is part of not only the importation of Spanish food trends and flavors into American cooking, but also a movement of more charcuterie and different types of forcemeat product —that’s also become extraordinarily popular. And in terms of octopus, again—the notion of pairing octopus and potatoes and grilling [the] octopus is just all over the map today in New York. So…if you ask someone if you could combine the three most predictable proteins that would have to be on a restaurant menu in New York, one possible response would be octopus, pork belly, and chorizo.,NW: Coming from St. Louis, as I did, how did you become so familiar with the New York food scene?,JB: My aunt lives in New York, so I had the opportunity over the last couple of years to visit New York a couple of times and eat at a lot of different restaurants. And this year, actually, I’ve been spending a lot of time going to different neighborhoods, eating at a lot of different places. I also read a lot about the New York food scene and the national/international food communities as well. I think it’s really important to stay up on the general direction of blogs regarding New York food and what different magazines like _Bon Appetit_ and _Saveur_ are saying about the New York and the American food scenes. And also forums like eGullet and Chowhound—just the general chatter in the populace about what people are seeing on an individual level in the food world.,NW: What got you interested in food criticism in general?,JB: In high school, I was really involved with food science and Science Olympiad, and I was also really interested in food writing, specifically _Gourmet_ under Ruth Reichl and a lot of Michael Ruhlman’s stuff, The _Food of France_ by Waverly Root, and more of the old school food writing tradition. I was just always really interested in food writing as kind of a literary form as well, so when I got to Columbia, one of my professors was working on kind of a literary food writing project, and I also stumbled into writing for the food section at _Spec_, and it kind of cascaded and snowballed into me becoming the “Food & Drink” editor—in kind of a random/haphazard way, I guess.,NW: Did the _Spectator_ pay for your meal?,JB: It’s subsidized on a low level. The entire meal is not paid for, but part of it is. Generally, the “A&E” [Arts & Entertainment] sections each get a small subsidy; the food section within A&E gets a small amount of money since we never accept free meals. Generally, our viewers have to pay their own way, though we do provide them with a small stipend.,NW: So what are you doing this summer—is it going to have anything to do with food?,JB: Yeah, this summer I’m going to be working at a restaurant in New York for a little while as a _stage_—an unpaid intern. And I believe that when I go back to St. Louis, I’m going to be working in a restaurant as well.,NW: What’s your favorite food?,JB: That’s a tough one. My favorite food—I really like hazelnuts.,NW: Hazelnuts? That’s a raw food!,JB: Oh, you mean, like, dish? I really like pork tenderloin, too. Pork tenderloin stuffed with figs is really good.,NW: What kind of Jew are you?,JB: Not a good Jew, apparently. I don’t keep josher at all.,NW: Are you keeping Passover?,JB: No. I ate some mazo, though.,NW: I’m also wondering how students at Columbia reacted to your review and the subsequent attention you got from national media.,JB: Well, I think just as in the national media, where responses were pretty polarized— either it was “Team Colicchio” or “Team Jason”—I think similarly, at Columbia, there was a group of people who thought that my review was embodying the stereotypical Columbia perspective on New York and this pretentious academic mindset. And then there was a group of people who thought that I was standing up for student journalism and the authenticity and importance of student journalism in the New York food community.,NW: Were they more or less mature than Colicchio, who discounted your opinion simply because you’re in college and who responded via Twitter?,JB: I think that part of the problem is that, on the internet, it’s hard to tell who’s a Columbia student when they’re engaging in…these different types of discourse. So someone can get onto GrubStreet and leave a comment that’s like, “I think that all Columbia students are X,” but there’s no way of knowing if they’re a Columbia student or ever were a Columbia student. So I think it’s hard to make broad generalizations about whether or not the Columbia response was mature or not.,From the people that I talked to it seemed that their responses were more realistic and grounded in fact, maybe, than Colicchio’s response. I think that Colicchio’s response was particularly immature because it almost came across as whining, maybe, or as very dismissive in an arrogant way. And I’m not sure whether Columbia was immature like _that_, per se.,NW: How do you like Columbia, and what are you studying?,JB: I’m studying English and political science. I like it a lot—I really enjoy the core [curriculum]. A lot of Columbia students are divided on “core good” and “core bad,” but I’m probably more on the “core good” side. I think it’s interesting having the entire freshman class take one particular course and then everyone having this shared foundation upon which to base the rest of their academic careers. And it’s also really great being in the city—I feel like I’ve been able to take advantage of the city in a way [that] at a lot of other schools, you wouldn’t be able to do at all.,NW: Do you prefer _Top Chef_ or _Iron Chef_?,JB: I prefer _Iron Chef_, the original Japanese version, to _Top Chef_. A lot. I mean, the original Japanese Iron Chef was amazing, basically—just really campy, but also really infused with this sense of the importance of food knowledge and food criticism. And I think that the American _Iron Chef_ over the past year or two has been doing a much better job of focusing on the information, the food information that underscores the chefs’ cooking styles. They’ve tried to move away, I think, from imitating the camp in an American way to more making it kind of an educational sporting an event.,NW: _Top Model_ or _Iron Chef_?,JB: I don’t think I’ve ever seen _Top Model_, so I couldn’t really make this judgment.,NW: [_Laughs_.] Thanks so much, Jason.,JB: Thanks, Thúy [Lan].",http://www.nassauweekly.com/after-grub-street-fiasco/,"

On a global scale, the Western powers welcomed and formally acknowledged Kosovo as an independent republic, further widening the already fractured gap between Russia and the West.  The presidential primaries continued with John McCain solidifying his hold over Mike Huckabee on the Republican side, while Hillary and Obama continue to trade blows and victories in the countdown to the Democratic convention.  Things remain much the same in our lovely orange bubble.  The drama and angst of the semester’s beginning smolder on—as seen on JuicyCampus. But don’t you worry.  You’ll be out of here in a few years anyway and by the time you have that diploma, you’ll realize what a huge farce it all is.,But that’s not the issue at stake in today’s letter.  Last week, we ran an anonymous story (“A Latte Runs Through It”) that detailed one member of the Princeton Triangle Club’s experience on the Triangle Intersession Tour.  We received quite a few (not unexpected) reactions to it—ranging from anger to disbelief to disappointment.  We wanted to take this opportunity to clarify what the , is.  Simply put, we are a newspaper.  We may be snarky, we may be self-involved, we may even be a bit verbose—but first and foremost, we are a newspaper.

"Regardless of what Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama tell you, it looks like the race for the White House is turning out to be quite the familiar affair. Of course, the fact that the Democratic nominee will either be a woman or an African American is ‘history-making,’ as is the possibility of a seventy-one year old Arizonan becoming President of the United States. While the demographic make-up of the candidate field is certainly a welcome change, I can’t help but notice that the political rules and tactics of the campaign are, to borrow a phrase from the political lexicon, ‘more of the same.’ ,In a campaign dominated by the politics of change and hope, it is almost tragically sobering to see that what is being promised by the Democratic candidates is less than visionary. To their credit, both Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton have begun to talk about the notion of economic justice–that the incoming President must not only address an economy in recession but also growing inequality between sectors of American society. With the absence of former Sen. John Edwards from the race, however, there seems to be little more than lip service going on. Say what you will about the four hundred dollar haircuts, but Mr. Edwards’ consistent appeal to a new American populism ensured that issues of social justice and economic equality took center stage on the campaign trail. With him gone, the remaining candidates find themselves in a mad dash to gather up Edwards’ delegates, promising middle-class tax cuts as a way of addressing Mr. Edwards’ concern over what he called the ‘two Americas’—that of the haves, and the other of the have-nots. ,I imagine that there is an economic explanation for why middle-class tax cuts could lead to a decrease in inequality, and it is probably a pretty good one. What bothers me, however, is that, while they may in actuality be a good policy option, they can’t possibly be the only one out there. In an election year in which at least one candidate is promising revolutionary change in the political tone of Washington, shouldn’t one expect a similar call for revolutionary change in policy? It’s of little wonder, then, why some political observers are beginning to question the logic of a political strategy that emphasizes , while failing to engage in a serious debate about the ways in which such change will be made politically manifest.,Over the past few weeks, the now-fledgling campaign of Ms. Clinton has made this the cornerstone of its offensive strategy. Over the weekend, the former First Lady worked on turning Mr. Obama’s strengths against him, arguing that being able to speak well about change in America does not necessarily mean that you are the best agent of change. Luckily for Mr. Obama, though, Ms. Clinton’s strategy seems to be gaining little traction among the electorate. The greatest challenge for Mr. Obama at this point is developing a persuasive argument to secure the nearly eighty hundred and fifty uncommitted ‘superdelegates’—Democratic Party insiders and elected officials who may end up playing the role of king-maker. ,With a state of delegate-detente setting over the Democratic race, one has to look no further than the Republican side of the aisle for a something a bit more interesting. Following his poor performance on Super Tuesday, former Governor Mitt Romney decided to withdraw from the race.  From a strategic perspective, this is perhaps the best move available to Romney. As a generally likeable and relatively young man, he certainly has the option of returning to the national political scene in the near future. And a long, drawn-out battle for the nomination would have done little to position Romney in the good graces of Republican Party insiders who are anxious to settle upon a nominee. ,With Romney’s withdrawal, John McCain has become the presumptive nominee. All that stands in the way of McCain and the nomination at this point is the continuing specter of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. ,Who is Mike Huckabee? Well, , has resorted to expletives in describing this former minister, and even the ,(a usually even-headed publication) could only come up with, ‘Mike Huckabee: Really?’ Needless to say, Huckabee’s own personality is difficult for me to relate to. He is largely anti-gay, anti-poor and well, anti-Jacob Candelaria. I’ve even heard rumor that he is pro-,and anti-,. What interests me more about Mr. Huckabee (and believe me, it is a perverse interest at best) is the fact that he has chosen to remain in this race. ,Best estimates by leading news organizations and the McCain campaign indicate that it is a virtually mathematic impossibility. Even if Mr. Huckabee were to win the Texas and Ohio primaries, he would be capable of doing little more than forcing a delegate fight at the Republican convention for McCain. For McCain, Mr. Huchabee’s continued candidacy can be little more than an annoyance. While Mr. Huckabee no longer poses a threat to McCain’s eventual nomination, he is nevertheless preventing McCain from acting like the presumptive nominee. What this means is that every dollar the McCain campaign has to spend in running a competitive campaign in Republican primaries is one less dollar the campaign can use against the Democratic nominee. This problem is made all the more relevant for McCain given that his campaign is strapped for cash, while the Democrats are experiencing a record year in terms of campaign donations. Huckabee’s continued presence in this race is also preventing McCain from moving into the role of peacemaker among social conservatives who continue to prefer Huckabee over McCain. ,So why is Huckabee still in the race? Well, it could be a matter of pride. Or rather that he feels he is representing the beliefs of social conservatives who have yet to find a place in the McCain camp. While these normative considerations certainly hold weight with any politician, they perhaps provide insufficient explanation given the grueling nature of continuing a Presidential campaign. What seems more likely is that Huckabee is staying in this race to ensure his spot on the ticket as a Vice Presidential candidate.  With a strong showing in Texas and Ohio, Huckabee will be better able to exert pressure on McCain to give him the VP nod. Securing Huckabee delegates will allow McCain to come out of the convention with what he needs most: the semblance of a Republican party that is united behind its nominee.,With the prospect of a McCain-Huckabee ticket, I am increasingly certain of two things: 1) that a coalition of defense-minded voters and social conservatives may provide the Republicans with a viable ticket in November and 2) that I will most certainly be voting Democratic.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_fifth_column3/,"

"You might have heard that a half-black man named Barack Obama is running for President. This sounds ridiculous, but the last few weeks have revealed that some have not.,There is DMX, for instance. In an interview with XXL magazine last week, DMX not only revealed that he had never heard of Barack Obama, he was incredulous that such a person even existed: “What the fuck is a Barack?! … That ain’t no fuckin’ name, yo.” If they ever met, he promised he would tell him to “’Stop that bullshit’” and admit his real name (adopting ‘Barack Hussein Obama’ being, one supposes, the most subtle ruse in political history).,While the rest of America is pretty well-aware of Obama’s existence, a controversy over his preacher, Reverend Wright, that finally boiled over in the last two weeks revealed that a large portion of the country wasn’t quite aware he is half-black, and therefore fraternizes with other black people. Or at least they demonstrated a stunning ignorance of what some black people actually think and say. White folks around the country reacted with shock and horror at clips of Obama’s preacher saying such outrageous things as “America is a country controlled by rich white people,” and that America’s foreign policy might have played a hand in inspiring the September 11th attacks. But the real issue was less the things Rev. Wright said than the manner in which he said them—loudly and angrily, with occasionally excessive rhetoric (“Not God bless America, God damn America”).,Just as it began to appear that his image was irreparably tarnished and that his apparently inevitable path to the Democratic nomination might no longer be assured, Obama went on television to address the controversy. In a thirty-eight minute speech that has already been viewed three million times on YouTube, he did something both pathetically (in that it had to be done) and inspiringly (in that it finally was) historic: he aired the grievances of black Americans, and he asked white Americans to understand.,“We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country,” he said—but he did need to, and he proceeded to. Further, in an incredibly savvy but also compassionate move, Obama aired the resentment of the very same white Americans who were turning against him because of his association with Rev. Wright: that many of them are hardly doing well themselves, despite being the heirs and beneficiaries of white oppression. Not only did he tell them he knew why they distrusted him—he told them, straight-up, that they were being duped. “Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.” If Sean Hannity were capable of parsing that sentence, he’d be ashamed of himself.,Obama’s speech—which will, as everyone is already saying, be studied in history classes—effectively addressed every aspect of racism in America except the one truly at issue in the Wright controversy.  By high-mindedly refusing to play into the standard distance/reject/denounce game—a fundamentally racist trap, in which white opinionators and power-brokers demonstrate their ability to control access to public discourse—Obama is now inextricably linked to Wright. That wouldn’t be such a bad thing, were what Wright said the problem. Obama is a persuasive candidate; if anyone can get the media to contextualize for once, it’s him. ,What’s at issue in the Wright scandal, though, is the way he spoke—angrily, passionately, without the reservations African-Americans usually have when moving in the restricted world of white-controlled discourse, in a uniquely black style of speech that a large segment of white America still and may never be comfortable with. Obama has made his career outside this rhetoric, transforming himself into an innocuous figure to white America without abandoning the causes of African-Americans. ,There is every reason to believe he will continue to succeed in this way; though the networks can run the Wright clips endlessly, Obama has a voice, too. Nonetheless, it’s going to be ugly. The internal contradictions in America and Obama himself are now manifest in his candidacy. Obama’s campaign is going to place African-American needs and issues in the prominent place in the public sphere they deserve, but even he cannot avoid the fundamental discomfort many whites have with the Other. For those who don’t share it, it’s going to be a long and painful campaign.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/race-in-america/,"

"Dear Readers,,Hello! We’re so happy to see you all. It’s been a whole week but you still smell exactly the same and you look only marginally worse. We open our pages to you—you lovely readers who support the little guys so we can support the big guys. (We’re owned by GM.),We have tried to make this issue as magnificent as possible; not just because that’s the kind of standard we aim for each week, but because we’re pretty sure the world’s ending any day now. We know that’s not a very professional prediction to make, but we’re speaking not from the head, but from the “head” here. That a volcano exploding in Iceland is a serious concern is a serious concern. We’ve had upwards of 240,000 deaths in 2010 from earthquakes. That’s really a lot of deaths. It’s hard to use science to find any real causes of anything, because for every person crying “global warming,” there’s another person crying “not global warming,” so all the facts sort of balance out that way. But all we know is that it’s probably a good idea to live it up soon, because Mama Nature’s kicking us all out any day now.,We know that it’s sometimes a bit hard to live it up here. It’s really not easy on Princeton campus to find new and exciting things to do each night when the eating clubs dominate the social world with their brutal monotony. So we’ve got some ideas for you. In order to shake things up a bit, we encourage you to get out there and give yourself back to nature a bit. Hug a tree. In fact, save a tree by donating all of your most fabulous clothes to our needy and attractive paper. We will either write on them instead of paper, or we will wear them ourselves, which means we won’t have to drive to Paris to get our new wardrobe—less gas! If you don’t have super fabulous clothes, please don’t bother donating, and also feel free to stop reading this paper whenever you feel like it; the jokes are mostly upper-class nose-job inside jokes, so we wouldn’t want you,to feel like, awkward if you don’t understand them or something.,No but lighten up, guys! Come one, come all—we really love all of you the same, and none of this is your fault, we’ve just grown apart—and join us on this thrilling endeavor as we dive into the world of magnificence in order to make our mark on this sweet earth that has treated us so well, even when we pee on her. Read us! Even better, write for us! (Meetings: Thursdays at 5:30pm in the Terrace Library.) Because all we know is that if we’re going down soon, we’d like to go down with pride. No room for mediocrity. No room for gray areas. The only panties we’d like on our heads during those final moments are Cheryl Crawford’s circa 1965, or Brooke Shields circa 2040. Nothing less than that. We’d like people to remember, years later, when everyone’s long dead, that the Nassau Weekly published some real good articles, and they published,them ’til the very end. ,Love,,The Eds.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/letter-editors-422/,"

"During the monorail ride at the Newark Airport, most of the talk was about how “crazy” the weekend would be at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The lineup was particularly strong this year, boasting Thom Yorke, The xx, Phoenix, Tiesto, and Spoon, to name a few. I was traveling with a group of post-thesis seniors ready to get our Bacchus on in a strange trip through the desert. I didn’t know a lot of the people on the trip all that well, but I’ve found that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Experi- ences like these are good ways to make friends.,The amount of substances people put in their bodies when they go on vacation is amazing. We ordered beers at the hotel bar. Xanax was popped out of pre-flight anxiety. The pregame in the airport bar can be justified the same way. We boarded a party bus the following morning and immediately proceeded to blast The Lonely Island’s “I’m on a Boat.” We drank champagne and imported beer. We sang CCR’s “Fortunate One” at the top of our lungs, refusing to let the irony of the situation ruin our good time.,If you want to get an idea of what the apocalypse might be like, the Coachella Festival would be an interesting experiment. The desert locale gives a good approximation of what affect a nuclear apocalypse might have on the landscape. While the lineup for the festival was spectacular, the volunteer staff was anything but. Few of the people I encountered were very knowledgeable about what was going on. I heard various stories of people asking where things were only to receive bemused looks. They weren’t even scanning people’s tickets at the entrance; more than a few people sneaking in.,Once we got to the hotel, we went to the pool. We ordered piña coladas. We traded copies of _Vanity Fair_ and _GQ_. We ate continental breakfasts: stacks of French toast with syrup layered on top, eggs Benedict, and pep- pered bacon. We drank mimosas, screwdrivers, and coffees. At the festival we ate falafels, corn dogs, and garlic fries. We drank Heinekens, Margaritas, and root beer floats. We met friends from other schools. We made friends with people we didn’t know. There was legally prescribed marijuana. There was cocaine. There were pills. Suffice it to say, there was a lot of chain-smoking going on.,Most of the people there were young and attractive, which is consistent with apocalyptic trends, given that once the apocalypse comes, the old will be killed, and their flesh eaten. Come to think of it, there was a lot of flesh at the festival. Lots of tattoos. Girls were dressed for comfort, but a little hipper than those at your average music festival. I saw more than a few of them strutting around in fur boots that reached to their knees.,When you go to music festivals with large groups of people, it becomes less about the music, more about going with the flow. Ultimately, festivals are about enjoyment, but often the trials of getting to a crowded place to see famous people can be very tedious, sometimes torturous. The weather was cool on Friday, hot as hell on Saturday and Sunday.,Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros gave what was probably the best performance of the festival. Looking like a dread-locked Iggy Pop, singer Alex Ebert owned the crowd from the stage. Singing coolly, Jade Castrinos provided the perfect complement to Ebert’s antics.,I only saw one celebrity while I was there: Aaron Paul, the guy who plays Jesse Pinkman on AMC’s _Breaking Bad_. He was much shorter than I expected. The cast of _It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ was also spotted. I only caught a little bit of Thom Yorke’s performance. Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers played bass behind Yorke’s banshee whispers. Both Camera Obscura and the xx gave great-sounding, medium energy performances, which is what you would expect from hipster make-up music.,Die Antwood, an Afrikaaner hip hop group, gave the greatest twenty-minute performance I’ve ever seen. The two MCs looked like extras from a Vanilla Ice video. My musical highlight was leaving Tiesto early to catch Sia (also of Zero 7) perform in an intimate setting. Her rendition of “Breathe Me” was particularly sweet. By far the most impressive feat of the festival was the guitarist of Old Crow Medicine Show restringing and tuning his guitar during the verse of a song, just in time to make the chorus.,It gives me joy to report that Julian Casablancas moved around the stage a little bit during his performance, as opposed to remaining in his trademark angsting-into-the-microphone/too-drunk-to-move stance. I also caught the end of Them Crooked Vultures: Dave Grohl laying down the beat in a sleeveless tee, dad-arms bared; Josh Homme, looking not unlike an Irish linebacker, playing a guitar that’s too small for his body; and the legendarily legendary legend that is John Paul Jones. Legend.,If you want to get an idea of what the apocalypse might be like, the Coachella Festival would be an interesting experiment.

Part of this experience may have had something to do with being sober while watching DJ David Guetta perform.,“Are you ready to party?” he called out in his funny accent. Communicating with young people all over the world, many of them on drugs, has affected the way David Guetta addresses his audience. He speaks in short, declarative sentences, reaching his arms out when he says something particularly emotionally-involving, which is pretty much everything once the Molly sets in. “I love you guys!” “I want everyone to put up their cell phone right now.” “I will see the lights and remember this forever!”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/desert-apocalypse/,"

"If you are reading this article, you are surely already aware that April 20 marks the annual celebration of cannabis. In the spirit of the holiday, I would like to offer a little tribute to this strange plant that has enhanced our lives in such wonderful ways.,Marijuana became illegal in America in 1937. The reasons, according to popular wisdom, were to aid the nylon industry by cutting out competition from hemp and to give police another excuse to arrest black people. This legislation, needless to say, has done nothing to decrease its popular- ity, and has led only to untold amounts of wasted government spending and millions of unnecessary arrests and imprisonments for victimless crimes. The arguments for legalization are overwhelming. Those arguing for it may hold up numerous scientific studies demonstrating its medicinal value and many more showing that it is less harmful, and enormously less addictive, than alcohol or tobacco, as well as figures showing how much money the government would make if marijuana, which is one of America’s largest cash crops, became a taxable commodity. Those arguing against it have nothing more than a handful of platitudes about how it would “send the wrong message” to teens, along with the increasingly untenable “gateway drug” argument. The only reason it is not legal is that too many politicians are afraid of losing their constituents. If it has been clear for a long while now that cannabis should be legalized, at this point it seems not even in dispute. It is almost like an inside joke that everyone is in on.,Cannabis is already all but legal in several states and, as time goes on, more and more will see the writing on the wall. I wouldn’t be surprised if a few decades from now cannabis prohibition seems just as nonsensical as segregation does now. A time will soon come when the ongoing public debate about cannabis will begin to have a different tone: instead of merely citing scientific studies about its medicinal usefulness, cannabis advocates may also begin to argue for the value of its psychoactive effects. Rather than merely a natural analgesic, it may begin to be praised as an enhancer of the imagination, a drug that stimulates creative and unconventional thinking. It is usually referred to as a “recreational drug,” but its effects are valuable for more than mere recreation. Indeed, they cast doubt on the validity of the ironclad antithesis of work against play that rips through almost every institution in capitalist society: the overflowing productivity of the imagination, which is revealed in cannabis intoxication, should perhaps not be restricted to the sphere of recreation. A look at the state of our culture suggests that the sphere of work could benefit mightily from a dose of imagination and creativity—two words that, in our society, are associated almost exclusively with children, as though we were expected to become unimaginative and uncreative as soon as we enter adulthood.,The cultural reference points associated with marijuana, like Cheech and Chong and Bob Marley and rasta-colored hackysacks, do not do it justice. They have little to do with the drug experience itself, and are therefore misleading. It is, on the contrary, the things that seem the farthest removed from cannabis, and the culture surrounding it, that inspire the most revelatory experiences. Its value lies in its power to divert thought out of its usual paths and into the realm of free-associative play. Unnoticed connections between vastly different phenomena suddenly become startlingly obvious, their obviousness flashing before one’s eyes like a grotesquely masked face. If thinking is normally analogous to talking, under the influence of cannabis it becomes more like seeing or hearing. Thoughts impose themselves on the thinker with the force of sense impressions, and the flux of their ceaseless self-transformation wriggles out of his conscious control and takes on a life of its own. If one then spends the slowly passing hours consuming ephemera that were designed to be viewed while stoned, that defeats the purpose: the emancipated imagination is locked once more into formulaic, predetermined pathways. Getting stoned and then watching a movie about people who get stoned is actually not very interesting—watching CNN is infinitely more enjoyable.,According to Rastafarian legend, the ganja flower first blossomed on the grave of King Solomon. Solomon’s reign was an age of boundless abundance and prosperity for the Kingdom of Israel, which had been united by King David, his father; it was Solomon who built the first Temple. But just a generation later, the kingdom split into two factions, the tribe of Israel and the tribe of Judah, and with this schism began the slow decline of the Jewish people into decadence and idolatry, leading eventually to the destruction of the Temple by the Babylonians. Even though it was an era of utopian fulfillment, Solomon’s reign marks the true beginning of the decadence that precipitated the downfall of the Kingdom of Israel. God, you may recall, punished David for committing adultery with Bathsheba; Solomon, who was their son, had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. David strayed from the Law, but Solomon threw it away entirely, and the golden age that he oversaw arrived only because he had done so.,Utopia is only possible once one has forgotten the law, in that brief moment before the ugly consequences begin appearing. The law constrains us, reminding us of our finitude, and by so doing it ensures our survival. It makes sure we always use less than we have, so we do not become accustomed to using more than we have. The ecstatic leap over the threshold becomes, all too soon, a headlong plunge into the abyss. But at the same time, the promise of utopia is what sustains us in the face of despair. It was their dream of the Promised Land, according to their Law, that sustained the Israelites as they wandered through the desert. But the material fulfillment of that promise, the promise of infinite abundance and eternal renewal, only came with Solo- mon’s abandonment of the law, and could only last a generation before falling into decline. We imagine that redemption will be for all time, but when it comes it is the briefest thing in the world.,It did not vanish without a trace, though. The soil, nourished by King Solomon’s body, generated a fragment of the utopia that he had incarnated. If Solomon had precipitated the downfall of the Kingdom of Israel by daring to make the utopian dream into a material reality, the plant that sprung from his grave serves as a reminder of that wisdom, which no one, least of all the Jews, should ever forget: that true utopia can exist only as a dream. April 20 is also Hitler’s birthday, and the anniversary of the Columbine shooting—both of these serve as examples of the sort of nightmares that occur when people try to realize their fantasies. By prohibiting the creation of graven images and requiring all adult males in their society to become literate, the Jews ensured the survival of the imagination, which, unlike anything else under the sun, is truly infinite. Just so, cannabis reminds us of the power of imagination that lies within each of us, by unlocking that power and displaying it before us with a vividness that rivals the most opulent of Hollywood blockbusters. If more people smoked weed, perhaps we would not need to spend so much money on movies.,It is no surprise that widespread interest in cannabis among artists and writers in the West began in the mid-nineteenth century. Industrialization and mechanization were accelerating, and the disenchanted worldview of the Enlightenment had mostly taken hold. The generation reaching adulthood at that time was the first for whom industrialization, mechanization and disenchantment were facts of life rather than revolutions. The adults of this generation had no memory of the order their parents had overthrown—for them, scientific rationalism was the order from which they longed to break free. They yearned for the sort of metaphysical experience, the sense of the universe as inherently charged with meaning, which modernity had made impossible. Modernists and their intellectual forbearers were interested in cannabis and other drugs because they hinted at the possibility of overcoming the lifelessness of modern existence without lapsing into prehistoric delusion. They wanted to experience the modern world as prehistoric man had experienced his: to see the holy light emanating from sacred objects; to make out the signs of demons and spirits in the configuration of tea leaves or the motion of wind on grass; to feel the world as a cavernous enclosure, and the night sky a sheltering canopy, instead of merely as the sign of the infinite emptiness of space.,No one embodied this yearning more powerfully, or explained it more incisively, than Walter Benjamin, that crownless king of interwar Europe, whose early grave, like Solomon’s, has spawned much interesting vegetation. Benjamin stands at the intersection between philosophy and art. He sought not to deduce the truth but rather to express, using philosophical concepts, the wordless knowledge that sometimes flashed before his eyes in moments of prophetic illumination. Throughout his life Benjamin often experimented with hashish, as well as opium and mescaline; some of the notes from these experiments were published a few years ago in a volume entitled _On Hashish_, which also includes Benjamin’s famous essay, “Hashish in Marseilles.” He is one of the only major philosophical thinkers to have written about drug experiences. And, unlike the few others who have, such as Huxley, he did not attribute his trance to primal deities or the great mystery of Being, but to modernity itself. It is an irony of history that, the more the Enlightenment dismissed all metaphysics and all spirituality as superstition, the more mechanization made them true. It was Benjamin’s intention not to tear away the curtain of modernity and plunge into a timeless cosmos, but rather to discover how modernity had in fact never left the prehistoric timelessness toward which his more reactionary contemporaries longed to return.,As great as the pleasures of cannabis intoxication may be, its greatest value lies in its ability to reveal the ways in which our world falls short of a utopian dream, much in the way it helped demonstrate to Benjamin the prehistoric traces that remain in modernity. The antidote to the disenchantment of modernity is not a recovery of premodern naïveté, but rather the realization, which cannabis can help provide, that the world is really enchanted, and that it is the disenchanted worldview that is naive. Even today, we are still living in prehistory. We are still intimidated by displays of power and captivated by brightly colored stones. The arms of the State hang over our heads like gods and constellations. Millions of voices flit inaudibly through the oversaturated spirit world that stands between heaven and earth. Our lives are filled with things that move but are not alive, things whose operation is incomprehensible to us, things that in any other time would have been called black magic. We peel and eat Snickers bars like bananas, as though they grew on trees. And disenchantment, which once liberated humanity from superstition, now serves only to keep us from perceiving the anonymous enchantment of capitalist society that still holds us in its spell. It is only by becoming aware of that spell that we can hope to escape its power.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/marijuana-maybe-wanna/,"

"What realizations, I wondered, were the museum’s visitors making as they wove through the halls of the MOMA. Like myself, they had come to see _The Modern Century_, a collection of 300 works by famed photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. While I went the first day, April 11th, his work will continue to show until June 28th. Perhaps to commemorate the opening of a new show at one of the city’s most esteemed museums, a horde of Manhattan intelligencia stuffed the narrow corridors. Despite the implicit vow of silence, the space hummed with their quiet muttering, pointing and scrutiny. Indeed, I could not hear their thoughts, but I could hear them thinking. As I slowly paced from picture to picture, I sought to extrapolate both meaning and inspiration from the marvelous exhibit; neither venture was entirely successful. But for me, photography is a difficult and dear art. ,That Cartier-Bresson’s photographs were fantastic hardly needs stating. Aesthetically, each photograph was compelling. Part of the allure is his medium—black and white film photography has a remarkable, meditative ambiance, which I can almost taste in the rich, dark dyes. Despite their crispness, such photos sometimes resemble paintings. And yet, not every photographer who uses this medium has an exhibit in the MOMA; no, these photographs have a distinct flavor. Cartier-Bresson helped mold photojournalism, and his uncanny affinity with candid shots, his ability to freeze spontaneity, has earned him a hallowed seat within the history of photography. His photography not only relates facts as they happen, but also facts as they are felt. His long career produced numerous collections of street photography, documents of time, which endure as history, and yet resound with the present.,In one such photo-essay, Cartier captures the business atmosphere at a bankers trust in New York in 1960. Through this series, in which every picture shares the name _Bankers Trust, New York_, we are witnesses, almost accomplices, to a historical transformation. The frames are mere slivers of the cultural and technological shift of the 1960’s, and logically cannot serve are representations for the entire country. And yet, they do. The photographs relate the reinvention of efficiency: workers drowning in papers, women poised within a male-dominated workspace, and the burden of mechanized bustle. The background, too, has character. The drab walls, and the clean, crisp desks, the monotonous tiled floors, the file cabinets which stand like bulwarks, underscore the order of the office, and create the perfect environment for the suited professionals. With impressive success, the series both records and narrates the changes within the workplace; he succeeds using more obvious clues (the outdated machinery, and the antiquated clothing) and silent clues (folded legs, evocative eyes and busied hands), which together connote rigidity, efficiency and historical transformation. It is Cartier-Bresson’s talent, which converts spontaneity into organization, and imposes balance and composition upon unpredictability. ,But almost as dated as the photographs themselves is the medium. Once, these images filled magazines and newspapers. Now, they are alluring antiques strung upon the walls of museums. Photography has changed; it no longer possesses visual limitations. Take a moment flipping through a magazine, or watching lush television advertisements—quite a few of them are riveting. Indeed, I would wager that decadent blockbusters such as _Terminator Salvation_ or _Transformers_ offer more visual bounty than any of Cartier-Bresson’s images, though they are admittedly of a different nature. And I won’t deny that models, particularly those enhanced by software, which monopolize numerous magazine covers, provide a pleasant visual respite. Moreover, such visual splendor is unequivocally more democratic than it was even 10 years ago. With a normal digital camera, only a dash of luck and a sprinkle of ingenuity are required to take the occasional, evocative picture. A more expensive camera, which may run into the hundreds or the lower thousands, can capture images with such crispness that they seem instantly professional. With the same luck and ingenuity, an amateur might produce work reminiscent of work in _National Geographic_ or the _New York Times._ ,And yet, my alarmist concern betrays my disquieting assumptions. I tend to operate, as others do, under the belief that art necessitates exclusion. If everyone can do it, is it still art? And I don’t trust my eyes—intuitively attractive photographs must be validated by the authorship of a respected photographer before I can declare my support. I can’t tell what’s good, truly good, without some direction, and I am quick to extol inscrutable work with acclaim because others deem it worthy. With the explosion of digital photography, and new venues for such expression (notably Flickr and Facebook), culling through the droves of new photographs for reputable art seems devastatingly more challenging. But as this technological direction is not changing, my criteria for powerful photography must, either to incorporate the flood of new artists or to protect photography from the dilution of mass production.,Cartier-Bresson is on the end of a changing tradition. Perhaps at one point, his photography was the only gateway to the world at large. And his snapshots of life were, for that generation and that period, novel. No longer. His ability to access the primordial appeal of the human eye remains, for most people, arcane knowledge. But media companies have written a recipe for eye candy, and they produce it in large amounts. Technology, meanwhile, expands beyond oceanic boundaries. With hardly a modicum of effort, I can peruse the world’s most abject slums, or extravagant oases, both of which I may never visit in person and both of which simply slide over my passive eyes. As a source of information, Cartier-Bresson is unimpressive. And as a source of visual decadence, his work is only marginally successful. ,Yes, his medium is antiquated, largely outdated, but his masterpieces endure. His appeal is the impressive composition of his work, its agile organization and, frankly, its age. I can recall what was, for me, the most poignant image in the exhibit. Entitled _Seeing Television for the First Time, Industrial Progress Exhibition, Beijing_, this shot depicts a large group of engrossed spectators fixated together on one tube. Their expressions vary; some exhibit surprise, others burst with excitement and a few are utterly uninterested (one woman is looking away, something elsewhere draws her attention). But their responses are sincere, and the frame is skillfully composed. The heads converge into a dazzled mob; the impression of the moment on these viewers leaks through the image. The irony of using technology to observe the expansion of technology compounds the nostalgic humor of the scene. But what sustains the life, the power of this image is its temporal statement. While innumerable images on the Internet serve as doors to distant lands, this image is a pathway to the past, for that moment can never happen again, not just because the people themselves have moved on, but also because that historical moment is over. That specific spark of discovery has been forever extinguished by the technological saturation of the 21st century. And behold his skill, Cartier-Bresson is not just a photojournalist, but a photolyricist—written in their faces is an intuitive glow that, it’s fair to say, most everyone can detect. When I see this image, I don’t just know, I feel that these people have discovered something new. This decisive moment (a phrase which Cartier-Bresson himself coined) contains an element of magic, historical fiction written with facts, which hearkens to a shared human code. ,Coco Chanel lazily embraces her thin cigarette, leans upon her plush couch and stares with empty, rigid eyes. Her epicurean tastes reveal themselves in her extravagant surroundings. One might say this image is all about the individual. During his esteemed career, Cartier-Bresson took many such portraits of famous socialites, usually members of the intellectual or artistic community; for the viewer, who almost certainly recognizes the name and face, context and fame make this voyeuristic invasion of Chanel’s privacy meaningful. But like many of his photographs, which depict people unknown, unnamed, forgotten, the individual is utterly meaningless. It is the expression, the poise, the sentiment, and the intuitive empathy, which resonate with viewers across the social spectrum. What such images mean, I cannot say. But that they have meaning within and outside of their historical context speaks to the artistry of Cartier-Bresson and the beauty of his work. His subjects are quintessentially human but practically immortal. As Cartier-Bresson himself said: “Photography implies the recognition of a rhythm in the world of real things.” Cartier-Bresson reproduces this rhythm with his work, that all of us might hear it. Technology has forever changed photography, but it cannot threaten the preeminence of his genius. The intuitive human spark, frustratingly difficult to define and articulate, no camera can implant. Moreover, his work possesses a richness of time and a fascination with truth, which these technologies do no share. Unlike the visually monopolistic work of the present, these images tell their stories gently and patiently. Their messages slowly seep through the viewer’s eyes, graze his mind and embrace his very being.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/decisive-moment/,"

" (Link),At first we think it’s a requiem; the minors chords on a solo guitar, “ROOSEVELT DIES SUDDENLY” as the featured headline. The women weep as Truman kisses the Bible, then as shadows descend over the mountains the soldiers don their goggles with resolve. Grief is somehow implied in their faces as they set out on their mission. As the first bubble pops, the guitar descends into distortion; the beautiful multi-colored atomic mushrooms implode and explode. The requiem seems to begin again with a solo guitar, and a voice comes in: “I wanna be in- novative.” Images of scientists appear followed by soldiers, further establishing the World War II context. The return of the distortion is accompanied by fire and kamikazes, followed by a solo plane. The message is rather explicit: “The war is already won. You’re flying high with the savior.” As the pounding 4/4 rhythm of the theme returns once more, the images of destruction are breathtakingly beautiful: purple-tinted pines sway with the beat of the bass, haze envelopes the screen, and a magnificently textured mushroom of gray ascends slowly. As a sort of bridge, the music quiets, and the viewer is confronted with destruction; the faces looking out over the barren landscape. They are not grieving, and on some level the music conveys a glimmer of hope in their neutral, pensive expressions. The swaying trees come back into view, now with an orange-reddish hue that gradually morphs into fire, and we are again reminded of the beauty. A treaty is signed and the Japanese surrender. As the music fades purplish swirling debris appears and finally the barren landscape once again. Yes, it is provocative; “innovation” led to the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians. But as the mesmerizing mushrooms of smoke bellow slowly into the air, the beauty begins to justify: a sort of guilty pleasure. Can we enjoy beauty that is rooted in utter destruction?,Plains vaguely reflects the recent trend towards surfer rock revival; this Miami-based band seems to have some connection with Surfer Blood, the Florida surfer rock group, who also played Terrace last week.

,Silence. An empty, dark Chicago alley. The shot is blurry and the dim light in the alley is dispersed in various directions. A sedan slowly approaches, Illinois plate in front, its headlights un- dergoing a similar dispersive effect. The video continually goes in and out of focus; as the car pulls into the garage, the camera is shaky, giving an almost Blair Witch aspect to this admittedly dark video. At one minute and three seconds, the camera focuses on the license plate (633 6967) and there is finally sound: a syncopated bass drum beat, then after three drum machine snare eighth-hits, multiple eerie synth sounds round out the song’s ambience. The garage door closes, the car is still on, and smoke fills the space. The driver is seen: a middle-aged white woman with shoulder-length hair sobbing against her steering wheel. Her blatantly generic features lend themselves to a sort of emotional rawness, which in turn is a sharp contrast to the song’s synthesized and processed electro-goth. While she wails in despair, she is illuminated by an inexplicable source of light. Her lipstick is bold and some mascara appears to be smearing. The lyrics belong to an electronically manipulated male voice, singing about “lost in / lots of time” and “mesmerized.” The bridge sets in to reveal a higher-pitched major melody that is played over the milieu of dark electronica and, simultaneously, a dark figure begins to take shape among the pixilated haze. As this melodic phrase repeats itself, the song takes on a less somber mood, and in the video the gravity of the potential suicide is mitigated by the gyrating naked woman who emerges from the ephemeral dark pixels amidst the smoke. The fantastical nature of her presence meshes perfectly with the otherworldly nature of the unintelligible, mumbling voice.	The dancing woman places her hands on the windshield, and the driver looks out terrified, like a child going through the car wash for the first time. The eyes of the dancing woman peer into the car, as if meeting the eyes of the driver, and she darts away, as the driver rests her head against her hand placidly.,The mystery of SALEM exceeds the mystery of the music video. They are split across Chicago, Traverse City, and New York, having only released two LPs and various tracks intermittently through online blogs. For this video, both women were hired from Craiglist; the driver was an aspiring actress and the gyrating woman was a prostitute. The surrealism of the video reveals a beautiful aspect of the music, its unique ability to make sense of the impossibly bizarre juxtaposition of a generic suicidal middle-aged woman and a gyrating hooker in a Chicago garage while maintaining its fantastic, emotional, and intimate nature.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/bombs-and-hookers/,"

"In an interview with Pitchfork in August 2008—shortly before they were to play at Terrace Club for Lawnparties—bassist Ira Wolf Tuton said that his band, Yeasayer, “always wanted to be the biggest band in the world.” This remark is a testament to just how far indie music has come in the past decade. There was a time when no indie band would ever express this sort of ambition, when to be indie was to aspire to a career in semi-popularity—in short, when “indie cred” meant something. That time has passed, though, and quite some time ago. Some especially grouchy fans objected when Modest Mouse went mainstream with _Good News for People Who Love Bad News_, which perhaps represents the first major indie crossover album, but since then such complaints have almost disappeared. No one raised an eyebrow when, for instance, Of Montreal licensed one of their songs for an Outback Steakhouse commercial, and people were actually quite charmed when Animal Collective and Dan Deacon made similar deals with Crayola. “Selling out,” once considered the death knell of an indie band, is now almost a right of passage.,This sort of climate is perfect for Yeasayer, who added, in the same interview, that they would sign with a major label in a heartbeat. They are not interested in being semi-popular, in playing small shows for their small fanbase and generally having a small career. They want the world. And, as the recent success of Vampire Weekend’s _Contra_ proves, the time is ripe for indie bands to break into the mainstream. The only thing more remarkable than Contra reaching “No. 1” was the fact that it did not seem all that remarkable—it actually seemed somehow inevitable. And although Vampire Weekend’s stay on Billboard’s Top Ten list was brief, they still managed to give the world some evidence to suggest that the rift between indie and mainstream may be about to cave in on itself, and that indie music, which has been crashing the party for a while now, will overrun the mainstream once and for all. That Yeasayer wants to be the band to do this is clear enough—and that already counts for something. Whether or not they are is not yet clear, but Odd Blood, their new album, suggests that they might have it in them.,_Odd Blood_ is tremendously different from Yeasayer’s 2007 debut, _All Hour Cymbals_, which in itself is a good sign: it speaks to their ambition that they are not satisfied doing the same thing twice. And they easily could have, because their sound on _All Hour Cymbals_ was so original and so cohesive. But that wouldn’t have been enough for them—they abandoned the earthy, organic feel of their first album for virtually the polar opposite. The album’s cover art is a decent visual approximation of its sound: it is a photograph of a human face, covered over with a metallic, rainbow-colored CGI surface. The computer-generated embellishments, which also include vein-like tendrils, extend upward and downward to cover the figure’s face and chest. The growths covering the figure are unmistakably digital, but in places they still look somehow quite physical, if completely unnatural—like polyurethane foam. Just so, the album’s sound is a brilliant fusion of digital and physical. This marriage is nothing new—it has been around for decades, although it may not have entered the rock idiom until Radiohead’s _Kid A_. Yeasayer, however, do it in a way that may be largely unprecedented—that is, in the style of a band that wants to be the biggest band in the world. In terms of song quality the album is a bit uneven and, as some reviews have already noted, rather front-loaded. But even the weaker songs have the sort of exuberantly goofy energy that only an unabashed pop group could muster. _Odd Blood_ does not sound like Animal Collective or Dan Deacon, for whom exuberance is an artistic statement often tempered with a lining of melancholy. Yeasayer have no artistic statement other than to make really catchy pop music, and their exuberance sounds more like the excitement of three kids with a houseful of new toys.,This excitement, however, did not keep them from writing some killer songs in which the dense production and the music work synergistically, often to admirable effect. The first track, “The Children,” finds singer Chris Keating’s voice as thoroughly encased in digital effects as is the poor fellow on the cover. The space-alien effect might have sounded corny, or just bad, on another song, but here it works. “The Children” is a slow ballad with a halting, syncopated rhythm, and the buzzing vocals contribute to the song’s oozy feeling. It leads into the lead single, “Ambling Alp,” an inspirational sing-along anthem that demonstrates beyond any doubt just how poppy Yeasayer are trying to be. Then there is “Madder Red,” whose falsetto intro is the album’s catchiest hook. Other standouts include “O.N.E.,” the second single, and the trance-rip “Love Me Girl.” There is a sort of magical moment about two-thirds of the way through “Madder Red.” As much as they strive for mainstream recognition, Yeasayer are still firmly rooted to the Brooklyn indie scene that produced them, and for the most part their album is as well. For a brief moment in “Madder Red,” though, you can almost believe that you are, in fact, listening to a mainstream guitar band, maybe Oasis. This is a good thing. It doesn’t sound like Yeasayer have crossed over; it sounds like the line between indie and mainstream has vanished.,_Odd Blood_ is not as good an album as it could have been, but it is a step in the right direction for Yeasayer in terms of both music and recognition. The album’s reception, interestingly enough, seems to reflect Yeasayer’s ambitions quite well: it has received most of its highest praise from the mainstream press. _Rolling Stone_ gave it a very positive review, as did _The Guardian_ and _Spin_ (which is, by now, a mainstream magazine). MTV even went so far as to suggest that they might be “this year’s Animal Collective.” Pitchfork, in contrast, praised them much more sparingly. This all shows that Yeasayer are well on the way to becoming the next great indie cross- overs—after all, they have already made two killer singles. What they need now is to pare down the sonic excess that _Odd Blood_’s cover art expressed so perfectly, and find once again the sort of integrated sound that made _All Hour Cymbals_ such an auspicious debut. _All Hour Cymbals_ and _Odd Blood_ are both very good albums, but Yeasayer will not be great until they bring the two together. Let’s hope they pull that off next time around.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/there-will-be-_odd-blood_/,"

"Dear The Housing Department,,Thank you for your recent email—the radio silence regarding the rampant lawlessness on campus during last week’s snow day was, in a word, chilling. I need not tell you that the illegal snow enclosures were of far greater concern to me than the historically massive blizzard raging, as the Italians say, alfresco.,I believe it would be a gross dereliction of my duty as a member of this community to remain passive in the face of tomfoolery. Implicit in the Honor Code is the concept that good citizenry requires not only one’s own fidelity to the rules and regulations but also a constant vigilance against subversive elements. Some may call this “tattling” or “snitching”; I call it a patriot’s truest duty.,To that end I took the initiative to catalogue, and begin the destruction of, snow enclosures in and around campus dormitories. Sadly, I fear the snow enclosures I found within the dorms themselves will not endure long enough for a complete investigation. With regard to the snow enclosures outside the dormitories, I presented the offending students with the appropriate literature and attempted to restore the snow to its original horizontal formation with my shovel. Unfortunately I was rebuffed and met with a barrage of snowballs; one of the offenders even implanted my head in one of the larger snowmen on Alexander Beach.,I am confident that your department will be requesting a complete enumeration of the rule-breaking activities I observed during the snow day. As such, I have taken liberty of reproducing my day in its entirety. I have tried to be as thorough as possible.,6:13 a.m. – The night before the “snow day” I ask all the students on my hall if they think we’ll have the day off. I plan on waking up all the students who answer “yes” to make sure they get to class on time. Am deeply disappointed when the email comes in saying classes are cancelled, but I feel a little better after I wake them all up anyways.,6:45 a.m. – Unable to go back to sleep, I busy myself taking stock of my emergency provisions. I have plenty of iodine for water, a pound of the homemade raccoon jerky my mother sent me, two pairs of wool socks, and a copy of ,. By my own estimation I can survive in my room alone for thirteen days. My previous “high score” had only been ten days, but I feel confident in my ability to go the distance if necessary. It might get dangerous out there.,8:23 a.m. – Scale one of the large trees in the Joline courtyard so as to monitor illicit snow activities.,8:31 a.m. – Fall out of large tree in the Joline courtyard after a combination of snow, my own girth, and my backpack full of rocks proves to be too heavy for the branch. For the first time all day, I wish there was more snow on the ground.,11:43 a.m. – Released from McCosh. After explaining to Doctor why I must be released, he says it’s impossible to tell whether I suffered massive head trauma in the fall or if I am “like this all the time.” I tell him it’s probably the latter and he lets me go.,12:32 p.m. – Lunch of grilled cheese and tomato soup. snow enclosure. I squirt pepper spray into the igloo to evacuate any would-be offenders; unfortunately the enclosure is vacant. Upon looking into the igloo to ensure no one is inside, I accidently inhale a large quantity of the pepper spray and collapse.,1:02 p.m. – Come across first illegal snow enclosure. I squirt pepper spray into the igloo to evacuate any would-be offenders; unfortunately the enclosure is vacant. Upon looking into the igloo to ensure no one is inside, I accidently inhale a large quantity of the pepper spray and collapse.,2:34 p.m. – Begin to regain sight.,3:04 p.m. – Come across functioning hot tub outside of Little. Can’t find any violations of housing policy but am deeply suspicious of its permissibility. Recommend a thorough investigation to three passing Public Safety officers. They inform me they have to find “some moron who’s spraying pepper spray in igloos” first. I salute and wish them luck.,3:32 – I come across another snow enclosure. Owner can produce a letter from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students but not a letter from your housing department. I then attempt to repurpose the offender’s hot chocolate as a snow-melting agent. (This is how I end up with hot chocolate burns on my upper thigh.),4:45 p.m. – Cold, dejected, and still seared, I return to my room. Consider watching ,, since it would be appropriate both for its snow-bound setting on the planet Hoth and for the positive portrayal of a totalitarian regime triumphing against an illegal rebel uprising. Fall asleep instead.,11:43 p.m. – Still groggy, I pull on my boots and snow pants and wade out into the unknown. Rumor has it that classes will resume tomorrow; there’s a lot of cleaning up to be done and I want to play my part. In my drowsy state, however, I run over one of these blasted snow enclosures, inad- vertently burying the two students inside.,11:57 p.m. – After spending eleven minutes searching unsuccessfully for the Jaws of Life, I finally dig the students out of the snow. Due either to the cold or the empty bottles littering the igloo, one student shows his gratitude by regurgitating the day’s intake on me and stumbling off, saying something about a WaWa hoagie.,The one thing that continually shocked me in my interactions with the rule-breakers was their inability to accept the idea that the rule against snow enclosures exists, and I quote from your email directly, for safety reasons. In response to their skepticism I provided them with several hypothetical situations in which a snow enclosure could pose a serious hazard to small children, the elderly, visiting professors, Provost Christopher Eisgruber, divinity students, members of the 1981 Ivy League champion Princeton men’s basketball team, and the greater Princeton/Plainsboro community. (Chief among them was the probability that such structures could provide refuge for all sorts of nature’s most vicious creatures, such as squirrels, black bears and international students.),It is easy to dismiss the offending students as harmless; my experience shows precisely the opposite. Even though the mainstream media may portray their snow dalliances as whimsical and naïve, the threat is real. They are often vicious and always dangerous; swift, decisive action must be taken. And I think we both know the only appropriate remedy.,Public safety must be armed!,I want the world to remember that snowy Wednesday in February and say, “never again.” Never again will we allow the illegal erection of igloos. Never again will we accept the derision of the housing code. Never again will we stand idly by.,These are times of danger and uncertainty, but I’d like to leave you with an inspirational quotation from one of my favorite historical figures, Joseph Stalin. Remember, comrades of the Housing Department, “Ours is a just cause; victory will be ours!”,Yours most sincerely,,

"Yes, men were in _The Vagina Monologues_. And yes, Eve Ensler, playwright, strictly forbids this. But honestly, you probably wouldn’t notice them anyway. When they leave the stage after the introduction, they don’t really come back. Despite some intermittent appearances, the play remains affirmatively feminine in scope and execution – and it is no less audacious, fascinating, perturbing and brilliant with men involved. ,All the declarations about angry vaginas, frightened vaginas, shy, hairy vaginas are delivered by women. The play’s three male actors, Gabe Greenwood ’12, Ryan Irwin ’10, and Sam Taxy ’11, do not have distinctively feminine lines. They don’t talk about experiences with their own female parts, nor do they speak provocatively about the pain of being female – all those lines are reserved for women. And the women seize these roles well. They perform these roles with exuberance and mirth, which perfectly ease the audience’s tensions concerning this most sensitive subject. ,Instantly, the play delves into the anatomical ins-and-outs of vaginas. The first skit, “Hair,” begins with a lively, anecdotal account by Elizabeth Cooper ’12 concerning her husband’s fervid desire to shave her pubic hair. This opening skit serves as the perfect conduit for the larger issue, because it immediately inures the audience to the fact that this play does not relent on details or imagery. Most everyone laughed as she explained her meeting with the marriage counselor, and as she explained her own fascination with her pubic hair. But we soon discover that there is much more to vaginas than their physical condition; as Elizabeth describes her strong aversion to shaving, and the vulnerability she suffers, she also reveals the momentous weight with which this play engages. After we’ve explored the corporeal intricacies of the vagina in the first act, we discover there are numerous layers to be exposed. ,It is the constant combination of humor and poignancy, which is this play’s greatest achievement. Eve Ensler’s comedy stays the discomfort of the audience, which, she suspects, does not contend with this subject often. By wrapping her numerous messages in jokes, she makes them more digestible. In the second skit, Arielle Sandor ’12 plays an elderly woman as she describes her vaginal misadventures in her youth. Reluctantly, she offers the story of her troubled sexual encounters, and her embarrassment concerning female ejaculation. As she slowly reveals details about a traumatic episode surrounding her first sexual encounter, she reproaches her interviewer with an exaggerated Brooklyn-Bostonian accent. Each reference to her vagina, which she calls her “down there,” elicited laughter from the crowd; but I doubt that the importance of this euphemism, and of her reluctance in describing it, was lost on the audience. Of course, not all of the skits were humorous; some dealt with sober issues in an appropriate fashion. “A Teenage Girl’s Guide to Sexual Slavery” told the harrowing story of sexual slaves, how quickly they lose their freedom and how difficult escape can be. Issues such as these are not comedic, nor should they be treated as such. And, indeed, every subject raised in this play has a somber undercurrent. But humor creates a safe space, where such issues can percolate more freely. The play works passionately to foster intimacy between the actors and the audience; this comfort and trust prove invaluable during the performance. ,_The Vagina Monologues_ was a play of few props and few costumes. This was not a play of visual splendor, this was not a spectacle, this was a conversation. And the stage itself helped to sustain this dialogue. This year, the play was staged in Whitman theatre, a small, thespian capsule in the basement of Whitman. Unfortunately, the location could not accommodate the high demand from the student body, and the play was oversold. But perhaps this sacrifice was necessary, as the intimate setting enhanced the story. As Maura Kelly, Grad student, raved passionately about her angry vagina, and pointed vigorously at members of the audience, her story truly encompassed that space. This was a bubble flooded with synergy, felt by both the actors and the audience. And the stage served as a shrine to the characters, their stories and their vocalized power.,Forget the vagina, these are Monologues; they are confessions, speeches and stories. These monologues are about the transformation of inner angst and bubbling anxiety into words; it’s about the oration of experience defined by concrete, anatomical differences. And, ultimately, that’s why men can never truly penetrate this play, and attempts to incorporate them, while dignified, miss the point. The point of the play is that women can speak, at last, about their bodies, and their minds. They can speak about their experiences and themselves. Skits like “Say It,” which concerns the Comfort Women and the Japanese government’s refusal to acknowledge their existence, and “Cunt,” concerning the reclamation of the term, work to destroy the repressive silence of sexism. These shorts promote the strength linked to enunciation, and the power of words. ,Why should we try to make something that is, by definition, feminine, into something universal? Indeed, the play betrays its attempt at blind inclusion with two skits, “My Vagina Was My Village” and “Comfort Women” – the former concerns Bosnian women in rape camps. The two actors chosen for these roles fit the phenotypic expectations; Katie Cristol, Grad student, might easily have Balkan ancestry, and Becky Bae ’11 is clearly of Asian descent. It would seem unnecessary, perhaps disconcerting to ignore ethnicity in finding actors. We understand that these issues affect different regions of the world, and while the empathy should be universal, pain may not be. ,Of course, men made no reference to their vaginas, nor did they dilute the power of the message. Their participation was peripheral, but appropriately so. What remains dubious is the motive for including them. The program states that “for the play to be truly inclusive, it needed to include male allies, and show that men are implicated in-and care deeply about-violence against women as well as women’s ability to love their bodies and embrace their sexuality.” But these men’s roles are neutral, and the play was never designed to accommodate male actors inclusively. _The Vagina Monologues_ are about women coming to terms with their bodies; the audience listens to how women feel about themselves, not how men feel about women. Despite the commendable nature of this decision to erode barriers, the men barely penetrate the core the play, the vaginal soliloquies. ,Let me be clear; I am not reproaching the well-intended choices of the directors; men did not harm this play at all, and the performance of the three male actors was impeccable. But the mere inclusion of men did not improve it either. Because they occupied non-descript roles, they did little to change the course of the play one way or another. But how could they? Men don’t have vaginas, and there are some experiences that they cannot share with women; if they did, they wouldn’t be men anymore. Yes, Eve Ensler’s prohibition on the participation of males is problematic, but mostly because it is unnecessarily draconian; men can’t give vagina monologues because they can’t give vagina monologues. Certainly the directors of the play understood this notion, and their production does justice to the spirit of Ensler’s work. But if _The Vagina Monologues_ are, indeed, too exclusive, the participation of men can’t change that. Perhaps we need a new play, not a vaginal monologue, but a sexual dialogue, centered on the experiences that men and women share. But let us not desert this play so quickly. These stories must be told, and, for better or worse, only women can tell them. But we can circumvent this barrier yet; Ensler’s gripping engagement with issues, both public and private, will enthrall and challenge any concerned feminist, as well as her male allies.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/decent-exposure/,"

"Years ago an American army captain ordered a million copies of a short novel, something to help keep the troops’ spirits up in Europe.  Many credit the mass production of this book, _The Great Gatsby_, as the reason why F. Scott Fitzgerald, who had died in obscurity in 1940, rose to worldwide fame, and Gatsby became a part of the American canon.  Part of this may have had something to do with the quality of the work.  In the latest issue of _the New Yorker_, Adam Gopnik referred to it as one of three perfect books in American literature, along with _Huckleberry Finn_ and _The Cathcer in the Rye_.  It seems successful tech entrepreneur Rich Shapero has followed suit, making it rain copies of his appalling opus everywhere from here to Copenhagen.  If you were lucky enough to walk by Firestone around lunch last Monday or hanging out by the sketchy truck selling Skechers behind Frist, you may have been offered a free copy, and you might have been very surprised that it wasn’t the Bible, or authored by Americans for tax reform. ,The cover of _Wild Animus_ looks like a cave drawing that seems to portray an act of bestiality: the outline of what looks like an Egyptian pharaoh is sodomizing a ram (the book’s main symbol/motif/literary-term-of-your-choice and source of constant amusement).  _Wild Animus_ is the equivalent of a bad horror movie.  It’s painful to read, but if you can find someone to read it aloud to you, you’ll be in for a world of hilarious pain.  I would recommend a vagrant or perhaps someone who, like the author, doesn’t have a strong command of the English language.,In case you don’t have time to wait at the loading dock behind Frist until someone hands out the CliffsNotes version of _Wild Animus_, here’s the lowdown: a musician/mystic-channeler-of-ram-spirit picks up a girl and they go off into the wilderness together.  Oh yeah, and he gives away the ending in the first three pages, something violent with a helicopter and a woman crying.  The mystic’s name is Sam but he changes it to Ransom for obvious reasons of maximized awesomeness as he proceeds to drop acid, channel the spirit of the Ram (“Sam could feel the ram’s exhilaration, his love of precarious altitude, the command of vast terrain, the clarity of vast space” [18]), and make sweet, sweet ram love.  Ransom is a smooth operator; over the first pages we see him calmly collect a coed’s digits while the riot squad gasses his Berkeley classmates.  He’s also prone to random bouts of cringe-worthy philosophizing: “Sam nodded, ‘He lives on love.  For him, sex is like rocket fuel.’” Or, “’I’m going to tell our story,’ Sam said.  ‘As a fur-covered shaman, a wild ram-man, chanting the liturgy of surrender” (67).  ,According to the Artist Bio on Shapero’s website, (www.richshapero.com), it took the author about twenty years to complete _Wild Animus_.  He took frequent trips to Alaska as part of his spiritual awakening and research for the book.  He has a wide variety of diverse influences including, but not limited to: William Blake, Jim Morrison, Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Willie McTell, The Church (not sure if he’s referring the Australian proto-punk band, or the Roman Catholic one, church that is, not the band, or perhaps the Scientologist one), Herman Melville, and Henrik Ibsen.,While I can’t stress enough what complete and utter crap this book is, if you can admit that Shapero has an ethos, he does stick to it.  Ransom, his protagonist, one of those artsy stock characters that only exist in parodies of 60s parodies, frequently breaks into song or hears an unknown inner voice speaking about the mysteries of life, the forest, and whatever the hell is left of _Fern Gully_: “Poise tripped, lunging into a cock and spring assault/Huffing, heart-flooded, headlong over a flashing flush I vault/Yes, I hear you chattering/No, I will not halt” (76).  I’ll give Shapero a quiet golfer’s clap for trying to channel the spirit of Walt Whitman, but he doesn’t seem to have realized that novels are as much products of revision as of writing, that spontaneous creation usually doesn’t work on the page, or anywhere else, perhaps with the exception of _8 Mile_, but even rap battlers pre-write lines and rehearse disses.  So yes, if Mr. Shapero sought to write a spontaneous novel, without revision or seemingly any critique coming from outside his acid-washed blood-brain barrier, then he has succeeded, but his success has resulted in one atrocious novel.  Within the first few pages, he commits every sappy, uninteresting cliché you see in any introductory creative writing course.  The sentences are awkward at best.  ,_He would know who he was and where his destiny lay.  What he sensed as he stood in her embrace, feeling the onset of the drug, was the beginning of something momentous for both of them._,_“Are you ready for this?” he murmured._,_She seemed as quickened as he._ (69),Shapero seems to know the definition of metaphor and recognize that it can be useful, but he shoves words into places they don’t fit, describing details and scenes well past the point of redundancy: “Sam’s concentration narrowed, his expression growing perplexed, as if he was trying to recall where he’d left something” (15), and, “Sam unbuckled his belt with trembling hands and stepped out of his pants, conscious of his nakedness in a way that she was not” (49).  ,Sometimes it’s difficult to discern whether the text is referring to Ransom or the ram spirit or whether they are the same thing and why the hell that might be relevant.  Why a ram?  Because it’s adept at mountain climbing?  Because it has horns and is therefore always horny?  Methinks yes.  ,_Ransom groaned, hooking Lindy with his arm and rolling over her.  “The way they spring—“He kissed her, full of wonder.  “They keep their hinds together.  A unified thrust.”  He arched against her, demonstrating.  “That’s why people think sheep and goats are creatures of lust.”_,_She laughed, embracing him with her legs, gazing adoringly in his eyes. They were running, flying, in their own world again, just the two of them, as he’s promised._,_He unbuttoned his shirt.  The hunger it triggered in her surprised him.  She stripped his pants down, biting his left pectoral, rolling the muscle between her teeth.  They tore their boots and underclothes off._,_“Like they do,” he said_ [referring to the Ram, for those of you playing the home game].  _Without a word, she rose onto her hands and knees.  Trembling all over, he mounted her, her warmth like a current flowing through him.  His loins fired, and he was suddenly the creature he’d dreamed of, head high, hunched and thrusting between earth and sky”._ (84)  ,You can’t make this stuff up.  ,So unless this is a piece of avant-garde concept art being orchestrated by the ghost of Andy Warhol from some obscure European locale, say Lichtenstein… I’m at a loss.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/theres-rich-guy-he-wants-be-famous/,"

"Graffiti, also referred to as street art or guerrila art, depending on an artist’s C.V. and willingness to make money, is not a new phenomenon. Handprints dating back to 3000 BCE have been found on cave walls deep in the jungles of Venezuela. Today’s urban culture, which revolves around burning (def: producing high qual- ity work) and bombing (def: scribbling your name on every wall, train, and B Level Firestone bathroom stall between here and the Canadian border), developed in New York City during the 1960s as part of Hip Hop culture. Over time new styles emerged, such as “wild style,” a kind of writing where distinctions between image and idiom become fuzzy, as well as eye-catching mural work.,Yet street art has suffered a fate similar to that of both auto-erotic aspyhixiation and daily showering, practices once considered alternative and dangerous that have slowly creeped into the mainstream. While street art’s inherent source of cool comes from its anti-corporate and anti-government origins, it is now also a part of the modern art world. The emergence of Bristol-born artist Banksy almost a decade ago and the success of Shephard Fairey’s HOPE posters are two popular examples of street art’s global presence. The MoMA and the Tate have also both put on street shows to attract younger audiences. But the incorporation of street art into the art world has had its share of difficulties. Art galleries rely on increasing demand by limiting artists’ production. Street art’s presence in the mainstream, best exemplified by Fairey’s HOPE poster, suggests a heightened importance of the messages being promoted by the works themselves.,Perhaps more than any other form of expression, street art is both powerful and peculiar in that it is inseparable from the urban landscape. Context is key. To “write,” as street artists call it, is illegal in the eyes of the law and is often an ex- pression of protest or dissatisfaction with government or corporate practices. Its proliferation in worldwide metropolises is no surprise.,Among major world cities, Buenos Aires has experienced as much tragedy as any. For years, oppression reigned as its citizens were kidnapped and tortured, or “disappeared” under an era of state-sanctioned terrorism. Men and women were taken from their families, beaten, or dropped from airplanes into the murky waters of the Rio de la Plata. The city has had its fair share of economic turmoil as well. In 2001, the Argentine economy collapsed. Tragedy, for the porteño, is not unfamiliar.,Today, Buenos Aires’ street art is in high regard, in the same league as that of other major cities such as New York, London, and Sao Paulo. Colorful murals and tags are all over the city, but the best work is found in the neighborhoods of Palermo, San Telmo, Recoleta, and La Boca. The city has its fair share of crews, RUNDONTWALK being one of the most well known, with their lighthearted stencils of pigs, pandas, and gorillas dotting the cityscape. Pum Pum, a popular female artist, uses latex paint to create works that are known for their precision and recurring images of cuddly things such as cats, bunnies, and pretty blond-haired babies.,The street art of Buenos Aires is not only comparable to that of other major cities in terms of creativity and aesthetic power, but in its innovation as well. After the economic collapse of 2001, many artists were put out of work. Some took to the streets and experimented with different sprays, paints, and materials. They started covering the city with stencils, juxtaposing images of everyone from George Bush to David Bowie, sometimes with ironic captions. Pictures of animals now coexist alongside fantastical monsters and memorials to the disappeared. There is also a high concentration of politically themed stencils along the Avenida de Mayo down to the Plaza de Mayo congregate, where the mothers of those who have been disappeared congregate. Messages about world leaders, the state of the economy, and the fate of the disappeared cover the buildings, benches, and doors of this avenue, along with a noticeably high amount of anti-Semitic scribbling. A duo known as Vomito Attack, which coincidentally was my nickname in high school, utilizes cut-up scraps of newspaper and stencils to create controversial messages. “Vote Poder/Corrupción/Mentiras” reads one poster, “mas hambre, mas pobreza… mas drogas… mas idiotizar.”,The rise of political stencil art is not the first time in recent history that street art has been used to political ends. In her book entitled ,, Ana Longoni writes:,“The realisation of silhouettes is the most memorable of the artistic-political practices that lent a potent visuality to the public space of Buenos Aires… [The silhouette] consists of a simple design in the form of the outline of a man-sized body on paper, later pasted on the city walls as a way of representing the presence of an absence of the thousands of prisoners who disappeared during the last military dictatorship… Eduardo Grüner thinks of the silhouettes as “attempts at representing the missing: that is to say not just the ‘absent’—given that by definition the entire representation is of an absent object—but that of the intentionally absented, those who were made to disappear through some form of material or symbolic violence; in our case, the representation of bodies missing due to a systematic polity or a conscious strategy. [...] The Siluetazo signals one of those exceptional moments in history in which an artistic initiative coincides with a demand of the social movements, and gains form by the impulse of the masses. It involved the participation, in an improvised and immense open-air workshop that lasted well past midnight, of hundreds of demonstrators who painted and put their bodies for the sketching of the silhouettes and later pasted these on walls, monuments and trees, despite the threat of police action. In the middle of a hostile and repressive city, a (temporary) space was liberated due to a collective creation that can be thought of as a redefinition of artistic and political practice.”,Therein lies the power of street art. Strip off all aesthetic sheen to nothing more than a figure on a public space and it retains its potency. Regardless of what is drawn or written, beneath every little fleck of paint or strip of poster lies an inherent little fuck you. When it encapsulates something real, a popular sentiment of mourning and frustration, it can make a profound statement. In the case of the silhouettes, their compelling nature comes from their prohibition, a harmless practice in a state that sanctioned torturing and murdering its citizens.,The best work in Buenos Aires is found in La Boca, a neighborhood any local will tell you to shy away from at night. While an observer might see graffiti as defacement of property, the creator sees it as him or herself. When asked how he felt upon seeing his work displayed in a gallery for the first time, a New York street artist said it felt weird. Seeing his mark on an MTA train, he added, was extremely profound, and much more affecting. To appreciators of street art, these works are more than an outwardly directed invective. In the context of Buenos Aires, or any other place where failures of the system are as visible as national treasures, it is a mark on the urban space, an act of self-recognition in an unforgiving setting. Latin American cities tend to be poorer and more socially polarized than those of the United States. They also have more graffiti, on average. An abundance of graffiti in an urban area is not necessarily indicative of a derelict citizenry. It may however, point to a flawed system.,Street art is more than artistic protest or public murals. In the case of Buenos Aires, it has manifested itself simultane- ously as therapy, memorial, and aesthetic expression. Street art may technically be defacement of property, but to quote the good book, “Where there is no law there is no transgression (Romans 4:15).” In other words, imagine a city with no graffiti. Now imagine the horrors necessary to make that a reality.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/politics-and-street-art/,"

"Almost four years ago I attended a symposium featuring rapper Talib Kweli that focused on hip-hop’s responsibility to the community at large.  What sticks out in my mind is a joke told by Mr. Talib (lyrics stick to your ribs).  When asked about his thoughts on Cam’ron’s “Suck it or Not” and whether he found the content misogynistic, Mr. Kweli praised the former Dipset leader’s ability to create the type of jam one would want to hear in a strip club, if one were into that sort of thing. Although, he added, if the song came on the radio while his little daughter was in the car, he’d be quick to change the station. ,Mr. Kweli was alluding to an unfortunate trend within the hip-hop community, and American culture at large: the objectification of the female population and its commercial success, even in the light of feminist advancements.  A more recent example is the success of artists like Ke$ha, who makes Britney Spears’ “…Baby One More Time” look positively Amish.  It’s also present in our language, perhaps best exemplified in hip-hop lyrics, where epithets and slurs seem almost mandatory (“Big Willie Style aside”). ,On one of his older hits, Jay-Z raps: “Now once upon a time not too long ago / A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe / This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy / But a pussy havin no God Damn sense, try and push me.”  While the word choice may be questionable, I would argue that the intent here isn’t malicious.  The problem here is the manner in which the message is conveyed.  It’s important to remember that art isn’t created to be politically correct.  Similarly, the use of the n-word has been a huge topic of debate in the African American community; while I respect Bill Cosby’s assertion that its use may be detrimental, I think it’s impossible to govern language.  It evolves over time and is subject to both formalization in schools and the capriciousness of cultural movements. ,One of my favorite Talib Kweli songs is “Black Girl Pain,” featuring Jean Grae.  The song is memorable for both its catchy hook and socially conscious lyrics.  “My mama said life would be so hard / Growing up days as a black girl scarred/In so many ways though we’ve come so far / They just know the name, they don’t the pain / Black girl”.  On the first verse, Talib raps about his daughter: “I keep her hair braided, brought her a black Barbie / I keep her mind free / she ain’t no black zombie”.  Here Talib relates his attempts to help his daughter form an identity as African American woman, yet the influence of society’s schema of feminine beauty is still present in the word “Barbie.” Maybe Talib chose “Barbie” because it rhymes with “zombie”, but while “Black Girl Pain” may speak some truth, one would be hard pressed to find a feminist overly satisfied with Barbie dolls’ influence on the collective feminine psyche; the essence of Barbie is still hot blonde, regardless of the dye color in the plastic of a particular doll. ,These issues reach beyond gender, race, and class. Their weighted sum is a heavier thing than the issues themselves (for proof, see the stream of radioactive diarrhea emitted by John Mayer’s face hole; seriously, like is this the same guy who wrote “Daughters”; like, wtf???) ,These issues are present on television shows as well.  Critics have praised _Mad Men_ for shedding light on the terrible things our grandmothers were forced to go through.  Betty Draper may be an early-60s update of Ibsen’s Nora Helmer, but my money’s on her going back to Don, which would effectively nullify the comparisons to Nora. _Mad Men_, perhaps more than any other program, lives off its own aesthetic; it criticizes America’s obsession with materialism and instant gratification by wallowing in both.  Would viewers even care about Betty Draper’s problems if she didn’t look like a Maxim girl?  Hear that?  That’s the sound of shaking heads. ,On a recent episode of House, super type-A administrator Lisa Cuddy fires a chubby, unattractive woman for providing a meth lab with pilfered pharmaceuticals.  What offended me wasn’t so much a skinny woman being morally superior to an overweight one.  That’s par for the course, I suppose.  What bothered me was how freaking attractive the actress that plays Dr. Cuddy is, and how much they play it up on the show as part of her type-A-ness, as if high cheekbones and cup size are customarily listed on C.V.’s. ,Last Sunday night, I attended a showing of visiting lecturer Emily Abt’s new movie _Toe to Toe_, which delves into questions of girl pain, both black and white.  Mrs. Abt is known for her documentary work, such as 2001’s _Take It From Me_ a profile on four women on welfare.  _Toe to Toe_ is her first narrative film. ,So far the film has received mixed criticism, both Time Out New York and the Post calling it a clichéd after school special, while A. O. Scott of the New Times selected it as an NYT Critics’ Pick.  The movie deals with two high school lacrosse players caught in a love triangle, one black, one white, the former determined to get a scholarship to Princeton, the latter subscribing to a life ethos best epitomized by the lyrics of Ke$ha’s “Tik Tok”.,Luisa Krause’s performance as Jesse the tragic white girl is the stuff that leads to successful careers, a great example of an actress embodying a character and putting herself out there without overacting (something Signore DiCaprio would be wise to remember; I would also ask him to cease and desist from doing impersonations of Will Hunting impersonating Marlon Brando).  Jesse is wounded in every sense of the word, walking around in loose-fitting tees and booty shorts, her posture reminiscent of the scoliotic lean of models and pelicans.  She is deeply in need of somebody to love her back.  Her mother, a cold executive type, pays her little attention.  When she sleeps with the third point of the love triangle, Rashid, played by Silvestre Rasuk, she tells him that she wants to have his babies. ,Tosha, played by Sonequa Martin, is the counterpoint to Jesse’s train wreck.  She comes from a rougher background, but tries in school and is well disciplined, perhaps to a fault.  Her struggle is both physical and mental: in the classroom, on the lacrosse field, and at home, holding her family members to higher standards and being brutally beaten by a lisping antagonist. ,While the movie does fall into cliché at times (there is a “running scene” cut up with a montage of POV shots of Jesse getting the joy railed out of her), Abt doesn’t pull any punches in her depiction of teen sexuality.  Making an honest film about adolescents is a problematic task in itself.  Teenagers tend to live on a kind of heightened emotional plane, which requires a carefully selected soundtrack and bottled emotion in order to recreate on the screen.  _Toe to Toe_’s soundtrack is equal parts underground hip-hop, quiet piano, and acoustic guitar fills. ,While I recognize the criticism of the film by Time Out and the Post, I don’t necessarily agree with it, as both reviews basically wrote the movie off, ignoring its emotional depth and the limitations of adolescent subjects.  Both reviews highlight the strong performances of the leads, while the Time Out review notes the movie’s “strong feel for location” (the vanilla suburbs and chocolate city of D.C.).  One of the best indications of well-written narrative is that none of the characters come off as one-dimensional.  This is the case with _Toe to Toe_; the secondary characters, Tosha’s family in particular (a working class African American family, easy prey for stereotype), are anything but stock.  Leslie Uggams gives a particularly memorable performance as Tosha’s opinionated grandmother.      ,Speaking from a man’s perspective, _Toe to Toe_ is one of those movies that make you feel guilty for being a guy, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing if it speaks to a social truth, which I think it does.  The fathers of _Toe to Toe_ exist off camera and are left mostly unmentioned.  Tosha’s brother, who has his own baby mama, is an unmotivated pothead, content to take his baby girl to a go-go (a type of DC hip-hop show) even if she can barely walk.  Abt pulls no punches in depicting Jesse: she is a victim of her gender, losing any sense of self-worth after finding out she may be sterile.  The men of _Toe to Toe_ become reduced to incubi, able to plant a seed then disappear.  In this movie, men have less responsibility; therefore they have less opportunity to redeem themselves. ,During one of the movie’s more troubling scenes, I noticed a girl in the row ahead of me shaking, and holding onto a woman whom I assumed to be her mother.  After the movie ended she composed herself and walked to the front of the theater to stand beside costar Shonequa Martin.  Visibly shaken, she emphasized that she’s nothing like Jesse in real life.

"July 2, 2009,Lithe and blonde and a hundred pounds, she sinks her toes into the smooth, silver stones.  I watch her. Slipping on her big brown sunglasses, which remind me of fly’s eyes, she sits down next to me in a folding chair.  I am on the rocks.  She fishes a book out of her purse, a novel—the one I gave her for her birthday—a purple copy of _The Bell Jar_.  I’m holding a memoir I just bought.  The sky is gray, which makes me sad, makes me wonder if I have Seasonal Affective Disorder.  I whip a rock against the boardwalk. ,“Could you please stop that?” she asks.  No, I think, I don’t want to.  I’m bored with my book, bored with this stupid day.  It isn’t even a particularly bright day, but I’ve forgotten my sunglasses, and the whites of the pages burn my eyes.  Or so I tell her.  Really, it’s the meds.  The Depakote.  The Risperidone.  They make it difficult to concentrate.   The Risperidone makes reading unbearable. ,My feet are killing me.  Rocks digging into my backside, dried seaweed stuck between my toes, in what hell do beaches not have sand, anyway?  I can’t focus because I haven’t eaten anything since breakfast—my gut’s making noises—and the sun’s in my eyes and my feet hurt.  I just want a sandwich—a roast beef sandwich with cheddar and horseradish. ,I grab a kidney-shaped stone and chuck it into the ocean.  A voice calls from behind me—it’s one of her friends—one that I haven’t met.  He’s handsome.  And waspy-looking, just like her.  I think his name is James. ,“Let’s go get some ice cream,” she says, and slips the book into her bag.  From there it will go on her bookcase next to her scrapbooks from summer camp.  I don’t want to be here anymore.  I want to go home.   ,April 12, 2008,“Smile,” she said, snapping the photo.  I had a leaf caught in my beard.,“Ha, your gap is starting to show!  You haven’t been wearing your retainer.  You’re mom’s going to be so mad!” ,“Hush,” I said, taking the camera from her.  It was a sunny day in Central Park: kids playing soccer, joggers in college crewnecks on a nearby path. I nibbled her neck—soft, no stubble, not like mine.  I tickled her nose with the leaf and snapped a photo. ,“Stop it,” she said, giggling, the smell of sweat and chocolate croissant between us.  I masked one side of her face with her patterned scarf, snapped another photo.  I slipped it off, kissing her cheek, her nose, her coffee-colored eyebrows.    The display showed an over-lit picture: an obscured background, straw-colored hair bathed in white, grass blades running along her cheek.  She had a slight curl in her lip that made her look mischievous, her kerchief fabric a series of lunar phases, a crescent moon covering the spot above her left eye.  I studied her mousy features: her nose, small like the rest of her—it comes to a fine point, unlike mine, which is rounded; her thin Irish lips, which mine seem to envelope when we kiss; her long, blond hair, as far from mine you can get on the color spectrum (at least at our age). ,“I like it,” she said. ,Passing the Met, we made faces at one another and I bought her a hot dog.  She loves hot dogs, which is hilarious, I think.  She’s pure New England, very proper, wears Ralph Lauren dress shirts instead of t-shirts, but she likes hot dogs.  And somehow I got her. ,After returning to her dorm, we made prosciutto sandwiches and borrowed _On the Waterfront_ from a friend.  Twenty minutes in, we stopped watching the movie.  As she fell asleep in my arms, I realized that for several hours I hadn’t been aware of anything but what we’d been doing.  And then I fell asleep.   ,July 20, 2008,How hard can it be to find a strip club, I thought. ,There was something in the road staring back at me, its face illuminated in the headlights.  A coyote.  So I braked.  Hard.   ,I ripped the wheel to the left.  The SUV spun out, and came to a stop on the other side of the road. The coyote was gone.,I put the car in drive and sped away. There was a bunch of crap in the back that I’d bought over the last twelve hours: spray paints, books, adult diapers, condoms, socks, tattered issues of HUSTLER, menthol creams, and a broken Danelectro guitar amplifier (a gift from my grandmother for my eleventh birthday). ,I noticed the streetlights and store signs looked odd, as if I were squinting: the lights seemed to bleed over in places they shouldn’t have. It was a scary feeling, because it was like I was drunk, almost, but I wasn’t, I was sober.  And from time to time, after passing an intersection, or making eye contact with other drivers, strange things happened that had nothing to do with anything, but _seemed_ to mean something, even made me excited, as if I were playing a game.  So I kept driving, faster and faster without stopping, to the point that I pissed myself.  I heard these high-pitched tones, like coins in Super Mario World, which I thought were coming from my EZ Pass.   ,I put on Coltrane’s “Blue Train”, tapping my free foot until the break at the 0:38 mark, when Coltrane rips it.  My eyelids started slipping shut halfway through the second track, but I wasn’t worried.  It was merely an inconvenience.  Much in my life had been an inconvenience, lately, my family in particular.  When I returned from an internship a few weeks before, I’d asked of my father one simple favor: to have my guitar tuned.,“But you haven’t played it in years.” ,“What the fuck difference does that make?”  I shouted.  I’ve never been a respectful kid.  I wasn’t exactly in the best of places at this point in my life, either.  “I’ve been working my ass off.  I’m trying to get back to my childhood, Dad, my roots.  My grades are up.  I’ve got a girlfriend who loves me, and the website is really starting to take off, it’s about time I started enjoying myself.” ,I’d invested in a social media site created by a friend of a friend at MIT.  While interning in Buenos Aires, I’d been doing a lot of research on Google.  That was when I realized that it was all about Page Ranking.  I made several calls to my friend Robbie Schwager, the co-creator of the website.  He lived in New York.  One night, I called Robbie’s mother to tell her I was coming to Manhattan.,“We’ve done it, Mrs. Schwager.  I don’t know if Robbie told you about our Page Ranking, but we need to take the year off to work on the site, or at least next semester. ”,“No, he didn’t, but Robbie’s out of town.  And we’ve planned a family vaca—” ,“Mrs. Schwager, are you familiar with the Chicago Cubs? They’re going to win the Series.   Now, I’m not saying the site is going to break any records.  I mean, we’ve got Facebook and MySpace to contend with, but we’re attacking from a whole new angle, we—”,“What are you talking about?  Are you on drugs?”,“No, I am not on drugs, Mrs. Schwager.  I’m just fond of sports metaphors.  I thought you would enjoy them.  I’m pretty sure Robbie hasn’t realized everything, yet. I’m just excited.  I apologize if I’ve been rude.”  I hung up. ,I quit my internship and was on a plane to O’Hare the next day.  That was at the beginning of that summer, before I maxed out my mother’s Visa.  Before I’d spray-painted the walls of the basement.  Before my grandmother had had the panic attack. ,I parked next to a Wal-Mart and took a long nap.  My cell phone rang. ,“¿Dónde estás?  ¿Porqué no llamaste antes?”  It was my grandmother.  I ignored her incessant questions, and I told her the truth, that I was lost, which I could tell worried her.  I myself was worried, because this kept happening. I kept getting lost, even though I’ve lived in the same place all my life. I told her not to call anymore, and then threw my phone out the window.  I had a headache.  I thought the radio waves were hurting my brain so I turned off the stereo.  I drove to a movie theater and asked the cashier what town I was in. ,“Crystal Lake,” she replied. ,She was far from attractive: her hair was greasy and she was overweight and she had bad skin, but I still wanted to fuck her.  I considered chatting her up, but I could smell the piss on my shorts, so I decided not to. ,“Do you know where Thumper’s is?”  I asked. ,“What?” ,“Thumper’s.  The gentleman’s club.”  She shook her head. ,I grabbed some menthol sports cream from the back and rubbed it all over my body.  The smell of mint was more pleasant than that of urine and semen, but soon the heat activated, and the inside of the car became a gas chamber.  My eyes burned.  Snot leaked from my nose.  After ten minutes of hell, I felt okay to drive and left.  Forty minutes passed before I gave up on my quest. I still had no idea where I was.  That was the first time I thought there might be something wrong with me.  I’m usually pretty good with directions.  Lily’s not.  She has this little credit card-sized subway map of Manhattan she pulls out when she’s lost.  It’s kind of cute.   ,July 21, 2008,I pulled up behind another Wal-Mart.  Or was it the same one?  I parked next to the auto center, and chucked my amplifier up in the air.  It made a weird cracking sound when it landed. ,Along the auto center were a series of glass-windowed garages, each with a stack of tires wrapped in plastic.  I sprayed “Obama 08” on a window, tore open a pack of tires, and picked one up and shattered a window. Then another.  No alarm.  Then I left.   ,I turned into a car dealership and emptied the vehicle of the remaining refuse: used condoms, men’s fitness magazines, protein powder, home décor magazines, peanut butter, a copy of the Kama Sutra.  I saw fireworks in the distance, not for the first time that night, and my eyes ached and I was cold.  I crawled into the trunk, and pulled the hatch down, leaving the window open. I dressed myself in adult diapers until I felt warm.  I shut my eyes, still seeing lights, flashing pinwheels of lights, and I pressed the panic button on my keys.  I pressed them to my forehead even though I thought the radio waves were eating at my brain.,I was awake, but I was also dreaming.  My parents were outside, looking down at me, crow’s feet around my mother’s lips and eyes (everyone says I look like her), gray at her roots, a look of disbelief on my father’s face.  My mother, who I realized looked much older than she was at that time, was crying.  She didn’t want to leave me alone.  I didn’t want her to go.  Then they kind of disappeared.   ,My mind was rushing.  I saw the house I grew up in, the jungle gym where I had my first kiss, swings with red rubber over their chains, a chubby-cheeked girl I used to know.  I saw the intersection of Carmine and Bedford, the convenience store I spotted a mousy-faced girl in, my friend’s apartment where she would later introduce herself as Lily.  My high school calc class with Mr. Shacht, the metal projector, Jenny Romero’s thigh peeking out from under her skirt.  The taste of weed smoke and Parliaments, Dave Matthews Band at Alpine: chatting with the red head on the brown wool blanket about Nickelodeon. I saw multi-colored bottles stacked on a shelf in a mirror-walled bar, connected like beads, dark amber rums and cold, clear vodkas, verdant absinthes and pitch black stouts.  I felt like I had a vacuum in my brain, sucking out every thought and idea, every memory and expression—it felt like God was in there.  I thought of my grandmother when she’d had her panic attack.   ,“Por favor,” she said.  “Go to the doctor with your father.  Please.”,“Fuck off,” I said.  They took her to the doctor, instead. ,The cops didn’t see me at first so I threw my keys to the ground and told them I was lost.  When the ambulance arrived, they had me step out of the car. ,“Shit, kid,” one of the police said.  “Are you wearing a diaper?”,I told the EMR I got lost looking for a strip club.  He told me that next time I went to a club, to slip the bouncer a fatty wad, which I learned was a twenty stuffed with ones.  I thought, Yeah, if I can find the damn place.   ,They wheeled me into a hospital in a straitjacket, which made me feel like Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.  After seeing my parents (for real), and signing some forms, they gave me pills, and mentioned something about Lithium, which reminded me of the Nirvana song, and I remembered something about farmers using lithium to keep coyotes away from their sheep. ,“You’re trying to poison me,” I said.  “I’m not a wolf.”  I remembered the coyote on the road, the one that caused me to spin out, and I told them about it.  They seemed to listen, but didn’t respond.  My brain felt like it was attached to a car battery.  I took my meds.  I slept. ,July 30, 2008,I told the nurses about the website.  I told my doctor, Dr. Lyman. I told everyone in group that Obama was going to fix the country and that the Cubs were going to win the World Series and that it was really turning out to be my year, it really was, all this was just an inconvenience.  A bald man from group said I was aggressive, that I should stop asking everyone questions about why they’re here and where they’re from (“Really, that’s my personal business,” someone said), and whether they like the Cubs or the Sox (“Neither, I’m from Milwaukee,” someone else said). The rest of the group agreed, which made me very sad.  I hated the bald man.  I hated that the group agreed.  I needed to use a computer but the staff wouldn’t allow it.  I needed to check my site’s Page Ranking on Google.   ,July 4, 2009,We’ve stopped at an ice cream store attached to the side of someone’s house.  This guy James is still with us.  He and Lily met in Beijing.  They’re talking to one in another in Mandarin now; I can’t understand a damn thing they’re saying. ,I haven’t been able to start my book on account of my meds—it’s a memoir about the Vietnam War—apparently it’s the real deal; the author spent like twenty years writing it or something, sacrificing plot to talk about how it really was.  Of course, I wouldn’t know anything about that.  I’ve never been to war.  I haven’t even read the book yet.  There’s a glossary in the back though with military jargon that I flip through sometimes.  There’s even words for civilians—like the word “joady”. ,This James guy is a like my own personal joady.  A joady is the guy who screws the soldier’s girlfriend while he’s at war.  Of course, I’ve never been to war, so I guess I can’t really have a joady.  But if I did, James would be it. ,I’ve always been fascinated with war and storytelling—my favorite book growing up was Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried, which is about soldiers in Vietnam.  When I was little I used to wonder if I would have made a good soldier.  My dad was one, but he doesn’t like to talk about it; they sent him to guard the DMZ in Korea and he came back okay.  I never touched a gun in my life, but I still wound up in the psych ward.  The worst part about being there was the feeling of being trapped, trapped with all these glue huffers, bag ladies, and guys with PTSD.  There was one in particular—he’d been a vagrant for three years before his family found him and brought him to the hospital.  He never said a word to me or anyone else, at least that I saw.   ,The night before Lily left for Beijing I called her to tell her my parents tried to have me committed that day, this was a few weeks before they they succeeded, they’d taken me to the ER, had me talk to a social worker, then locked me in a room with padded walls after I’d yelled at a cop.  The left me in there for a while and I had to use the bathroom so I started pounding on the door, but the nurse just ignored me so I kept pounding and pounding.  Finally, I felt like my bladder was going to explode, so I pissed myself, just as the nurse came in and started screaming. ,When I told Lily what happened, about how they locked me in the room and how I pissed myself, that they said I’d had a psychotic break and I needed to go to the hospital for a while, she listened, and said it would be OK, but that was all she said.  She didn’t say she was coming back.  I asked her to come back but she said she had to go and I started crying and I called her a bitch and I hung up the phone.  The next day she was on a plane to Beijing. ,My memories of our relationship, pre-commitment, are from a fantasy.  I dream about kisses, croissants, and Saturdays in Central Park.  Bull shit, mostly.  None of it’s real, not anymore.  I mean look at me: I’m eating ice cream right now with Lily and my own personal joady.  This is a nightmare.  I don’t even know if I’m going back to school yet and my family is afraid of me.  I’ve tried to talk Lily about it, but I can tell that I’m boring her, that she resents me.  I’m sorry for the things I did, that I took her for granted, that I was out of my mind.  But I was _out of my mind_.  That has to count for something.  They put me in a straitjacket, for Christ’s sake.  God knows what they’re going to say when I get back to school.  If I get back to school.  _Aren’t you supposed to be studying abroad?_ ,Last night I dreamt I’d been driving somewhere with Lily, my parents, and my grandmother in the car.  It was one of those dreams where you think you wake up but you’re still dreaming.  I woke up in a patch of grass and shiny little glass shards.  My hands, my face, and my legs were covered in blood.  I stood up, and there was my family and Lily, trapped in the car—which I’d wrapped around a telephone pole.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/my-own-personal-joady/,"

"We leapt from our beds as soon as we heard it, a tinkling, ringing music that yawned incessantly right outside our window; we’d never actually fallen asleep of course, simply lying awake in the darkness trying to control our breathing while listening for the twitter of sleigh bells. When it finally came it sounded different to us somehow, as though the merry jingling we’d hoped for had been replaced by a constant, screeching wail, but as the lights outside flashed bright and red across our faces, we lost ourselves in the expectation of unopened presents. As the noise grew closer, accompanied now by the crunching of snow, we imagined the tapping of reindeer’s hooves against the shingles, not the tread of heavy industrial tires churning through the slush in the street. The sleigh landed not above us but outside on the lawn, and as the men, his helpers, made their way through the front door instead of the chimney, we strained from upstairs to see all the things they’d brought for us. We were disappointed moments later when they emerged, carrying between them a motionless slab draped beneath a black rubber sheet. As they loaded the package onto the back of their sleigh and raced off towards the city, we smiled to ourselves that they didn’t stop to visit any of our neighbors.,In the morning, our father would tell us that we’d seen nothing, that the men in their dark blue uniforms—so unlike Santa’s—had come only to pick up a delivery, a table that had broken and needed to be taken somewhere—“To the factory?”—to be repaired.

"Sunday, March 16 was the premier of Mary Zimmerman’s Argonautika at the Matthews Theater at McCarter. The two-and-a-half-hour play is an adaptation of the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts, starring Jake Suffian as Jason, Lisa Tejero as Hera, and Sofia Jean Gomez as Athena. Zimmerman, known for her inventive vision, won a Tony for Best Direction in 2002 for her adaptation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Zimmerman’s production is an impressive, oftentimes explosive, interpretation of the story of Jason and the Argonauts, filled with whim, wit, and a touch of the modern.,Argonautika presents some obvious staging problems: “How do you do a fleet of boats? Or 50 men on board? Or sea monsters or gods flying around?” said Zimmerman in an interview with Lila Neugebauer. Zimmerman handles the unique challenges of adapting the myth with grace and innovation, turning the stage into a beautiful wooden deck. At stage-right is a tall mast with four ropes attached to the top, and at stage-left is a plank suspended from the ceiling, running parallel to its width. To recreate a violent storm incited by Boreus, a large white sheet is attached to the mast, and members of the cast take turns beating it against the pole to mimic the effect of billowing winds. Some actors slide back and forth across the stage, shouting, while others jump and swing from the ropes. The result is a complete transformation: the members of the Shakespeare Theatre Company easily become Jason and the Argonauts, tossed dangerously about on a rocking ship, battling an angry god determined to keep them from departing.,One of the best directorial achievements of the production is Zimmerman’s fantastic evil creatures. With the help of costume designer Ana Kuzmanic and puppetry designer Michael Montenegro, Zimmerman translates the Ancient Greek beasts into visual spectacles. When the Argonauts arrive at Salmydessus, they find the hysterical King Phineus running from Harpies. Zimmerman’s interpretation of the food-snatching lady-birds are junk-art beasts with monstrous faces like hockey masks. The wire-paper-feather constructions are attached to long black poles carried by cast members, who frantically run back and forth and screech. The Harpies, like Zimmerman, are not without a sense of humor. One actor pulls a small handle attached to his pole and his corresponding Harpy happily defecates on King Phineus. Another Harpy barfs on him. While the Harpies’ effect is one part side-splitting laughter and one part physical disgust, Zimmerman’s Amycus is nothing but uproar. The actor who doubles as Hercules is the legs of the giant boxer, while one of the smaller-sized actresses sits on his shoulders and acts as Amycus’s torso. Both are draped under a huge sheet. Amycus’s arms are at least four feet long with boulders for hands and his head is a huge appendage with a crude, rock-like face. Somewhere within the folds of the sheet one of the actors manipulates the mouth of the creature as he roars and blunders about the stage, knocking over men. The boxing match with Pollux is a hilarious display—the twelve-foot-tall beast throws punches and the Argonauts heckle like fratters. But Zimmerman’s creatures aren’t all ridiculous; her interpretation of the sleepless dragon that guards the Golden Fleece is haunting. As Jason and Medea flee with the Fleece, their victory is interrupted by a slow, chilling hiss. Out of the shadowy darkness comes a glowing yellow orb nearly four feet wide. The dragon eye is a huge Chinese lantern suspended in mid-air. An actor dressed in black kneels on the ground, proffering the eye to Jason. Medea sings sweetly to the floating ball. The actor slowly closes a wire handle, and the dragon’s eyelid slips lower and lower with the sound of the lulling music.,The production falls short in its performance, not in Zimmerman’s aesthetic vision. Allen Gilmore, who plays Kings Pelias and Phineus, among others, is often too shrill and completely one-dimensional in his silliness. Gomez’s Athena, in a stunning crimson dress and golden helmet, is equally guilty of overacting, using a “warrior’s” voice too deep to be her own. Her gravity is at times reminiscent of a teenage girl trying too hard to be a bro. Probably the worst part is Suffian’s Jason, whose blandness leaves the audience wondering why we ought to be invested in the Argonauts’ quest at all. Jesse J. Perez as Idmon and Søren Oliver as Hercules are rather good in their performances, but Atley Loughride’s Medea is the play’s gem. Despite her sometimes over-squeakiness, she is skillfully fluid in her hysteria, moving from youthful naïveté to spellbound sexual obsession and finally to vengeful murderousness.,The oftentimes dubious acting of Argonautika does not detract from what Zimmerman is so well known for—her majestic and unforgettable artistic direction. Parts of the story are disjointed, the modern dialogue seems forced, and the ending is a little rushed, yet in spite of it all the play closes with a stunning final scene that overshadows the missteps. Like the dragon-eye that hangs aloft in space, Zimmerman’s vision is a strange species of beautiful. At once powerful and beguiling, Zimmerman’s eye navigates McCarter’s space with the control and grace of a master.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/style-substance/,"

"When a dog seriously injures someone, the conventional wisdom has always been to have it put down.  No matter the circumstances, a potentially vicious dog presents its owners with enormous liability.  Should the dog attack again, what could possibly be said in its defense?  This is precisely the conventional wisdom that is being challenged in Princeton, NJ this year with the trial and appeals of Congo the German shepherd.  His case has the potential not only to set a new precedent in New Jersey dog law, but also to usher in a new era in animal rights.  At issue are the burden of proof and the definition of provocation.,On June 5th of last year, Honduran landscaper Giovanni Rivera, 42, was mauled by Congo, a 2 1/2-year-old 85-pound German shepherd. It is not the simple summary, though, but the details of the case which are in dispute.  According to Congo’s owners, Guy and Elizabeth James, a group of yard workers arrived at their Princeton Township estate earlier than expected and failed to heed the James’ request that they wait in the car while the dogs were secured.  In the minutes of commotion that ensued after exiting the vehicle, Mr. Rivera became alarmed and grabbed Mrs. James to shield himself from Congo and may or may not have pulled her to the ground before Congo lunged at him.  Congo proceeded to maul Mr. Rivera for three minutes, while another yard worker defended himself with a rake from the attack of four other German shepherds.  Hospital photos show Mr. Rivera’s abdomen, legs, and left ear seriously bloodied.  The New York Times reports that Mr. Rivera spent five days in the hospital where he received 65 rabies shots (apparently the dogs were not up-to-date with their treatment) and underwent a three-hour operation. In an agreement with the James’ homeowners insurance company, Mr. Rivera received $250,000 plus medical expenses.,The Jameses cited Mr. Rivera’s conduct as provocation and resisted early suggestions that Congo be put down.  The five dogs involved in the attack were taken from the property the next day by Animal Control, and Congo remained in a shelter throughout the summer.  On October 30th, the Princeton Township Municipal Court declared Congo vicious and ordered him to be put down.  The other dogs were to be labeled as potentially dangerous, a designation that carries a heavy annual licensing fee among other restrictions and regulations.,In the thirteen days between the ruling and the formal recording of the sentence, all hell broke loose in the blogosphere and in the local press (although curiously The Daily Princeton, our paper of record, chose not to cover the controversy).  The popular line of reasoning seems to have been that Mr. Rivera, as an illegal immigrant, was not entitled to his settlement, and in fact deserved much worse than he received on the morning of June 5th.  While it must be said that many of Congo’s supporters harbor no resentment towards Mr. Rivera personally (Congo has been something of a cause célèbre for loyal pet owners), the same could hardly be said for all of them.  A post dated November 10th on the  pro-Israel blog Smooth Stone reads in part:,“Giovanni Rivera should be deported; he is an illegal alien who broke the law to get into this country. [Bolding from original text]  He has no right to earn a living here, he has no rights to medical benefits, certainly no right to use our legal system to his advantage. The fact that he employs other illegal aliens makes him a trafficker, which is also a crime which should should [sic] compound his illegal status. He probably undercuts all of his competition, and therefore, is taking bread out of the mouths of legitimate American citizens.”,Though the Jameses have consistently rejected the suggestion that their case has a place in the immigration debate, many in the community have echoed the sentiment of one internet commenter who anonymously labeled the victim as “illegal scum.”  Needless to say, the hostile tone of the discourse  raises the inevitable question: what would the situation  look like were the victim not a 42-year-old Honduran, but instead an 8-year-old white girl?  One is rather forcefully reminded of the lyrics from Paul Simon’s “Adios Hermanos”: ,A Spanish boy could be killed every night of the week,But just let some white boy die,And the world goes crazy for blood-Latin blood.,I don’t lie when I speak.,One also has a hard time imagining what the Jameses would say were such a girl Congo’s next victim. ,The Jameses decided to appeal the verdict of the local court and received a stay of execution along with permission to take Congo home.  Briefs filed by Robert Lytle, the James’ attorney, tell the story of erratic yard workers wielding rakes against brave German shepherds whose only crime was defending their pack.  Court papers also highlight the changes Mr. Rivera made to his initial testimony. Deputy First Assistant Prosecutor Doris Galuchie and the State of New Jersey contend that the original ruling was consistent with state statute and that Princeton Township successfully  demonstrated that the attack was disproportionate to the alleged provocation.,A legislative effort on the part of Assemblymen Neil Cohen and Patrick Diegnan Jr. to save the German shepherd remains pending. The bill entitled “Congo’s Law” (A4597) was introduced in Trenton last December to retroactively encumber the state with a greater burden of proof and to provide an alternative to euthanasia for dogs deemed vicious.  Section 2 of the standing 1989 dog law would be amended to incorporate a definition of provocation that explicitly includes, “(1) entering property without the presence, permission, or direction of the owner… or (2) gesticulating at, striking, grabbing, poking, prodding, or otherwise threatening the dog, its offspring, its owner, or a family member of its owner.”  Furthermore, the operative verb requiring dogs that have attacked humans to be impounded is changed from “shall” to “may.”  Most crucially, dogs that are deemed vicious “beyond a reasonable doubt” may be euthanized OR kept by the owner under similar conditions to those required for dogs labeled potentially dangerous. ,It is unlikely that this bill will pass in time to save Congo.  His only hope now is to win his appeal in front of Superior Court Judge Mitchel Ostrer on Friday, April 5th.  According to the prosecutor, Mr. Lytle must demonstrate that Congo was not only provoked, but also that his response was proportional to the provocation.  Until Friday, the plea deal offered by the Township, which would require Congo to be labeled potentially dangerous, but allow him to remain alive, remains valid.  So far the Jameses have rejected the offer.,At stake in this case is nothing less than the way we perceive the legal rights of animals.  Is the judge to understand provocative actions through the eyes of the dog or through those of the victim?  What sort of right to life does a dog have when it has demonstrated a willingness to attack?  How does one address an appeal based on principles of equity, fairness, and good intentions gone awry when the defendant, Congo, has no notion of any of these?,New Jersey has had weird dog cases before, including that of an Akita, who bit a 10-year-old girl in the face on Christmas Day in 1990, removing a sizable chunk of her lip in the process.  In that case, “Taro” was pardoned by then-Governor Whitman, but with the proviso that the dog leave New Jersey and never return.  In this area of jurispudence, where dogs become illegals, and illegals receive epithets instead of get-well cards, it is hard to draw clear lines between innocence, guilt, and injury. Yet somewhere in this mesh of the tragic and the bizarre stand the relevant and pressing issues which face law experts and legislators today. The question is whether we let these sleeping issues lie–whether we are well prepared to handle the results of our own provocations.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/bite-me-congos-case/,"

"Good sex might be priceless, but there’s still a market for it.,Ideally, such a market doesn’t involve money—but demand is rampant, supply plentiful, and the exchange goes on every day in every way.  It involves a good bit of utility, but also, as with any investment, a certain amount of risk. And, just like every other market (aside from those in the fantasy world of economics textbooks), the market for sex is imperfect.,Most importantly, asymmetric information pervades the market for sex. With an endless variety of desires, any individual knows more about his or her own sexual habits than any would-be partner: Is he actually interested? Does she like to mix things up? Will he want to cuddle after? Asymmetric information can be exciting.,But in the age of HIV/AIDS and the list of other STDs that permeate the contemporary love market, secrets about sexual health can be dangerous mysteries. And since no one wants to contract a sexually transmitted disease, whether herpes, syphilis, or, of course, HIV, it is in each healthy individual’s best interest to choose healthy partners. But how?,Abstinence or protection is not enough. Without the anchor of a soul (or sole) mate, Americans are sleeping around, creating many vectors for disease. According to a 2004 ABC News survey, the average American sleeps with 13 partners before settling down. More partners means more risk; and despite whatever condoms, gels, and blind faith people are relying on to protect them, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that 19 million new infections still occur each year.,Proper testing is a prerequisite to stemming the spread of STDs. Yet even the most conscientious currently have only limited incentive to get tested, especially for diseases that may have no noticeable symptoms. Most syphilis cases, for example, are transmitted by individuals oblivious to their infection. And while some who do get tested carry around their lab results, most do not. The current lab printouts are cumbersome and there is a stigma associated with even bringing up the topic. This creates a serious information problem.,The solution to this problem of viruses, trust, and lust may be for potential lovers to view their exchange not as an act of passion, but rather as one of market economics. Like any profitable transaction, if done correctly both parties benefit, and no one suffers negative externalities. While there’s no way to force rationality on sex any more than on any other good, one solution for those of us willing to put dispassion before passion is, for lack of a sexier description, a medical identification card. The card would be far more credible than a mere “Baby, I’m clean” and far less cumbersome than sharing a full lab printout. It has the potential to increase trust and reduce the stigma of talking about STDs in the heat of passion.,Every time someone chooses to get tested for an STD, the lab can record on a wallet-sized card the patient’s name and the dates on which he or she last tested negative for various diseases. The card proves the individual’s medical status, and then each can choose to share—or not to share—his or her card with potential partners. Since every person is in control of his or her own information, this system raises no privacy concerns. It is even consistent with the infamously stringent Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).,Anyone with a shred of responsibility and the slightest intention of sowing his or her wild oats should get tested frequently and learn to share his or her card with potential partners before the candles are lit, or the last Cuervo shot poured. More important still, those who do share must expect reciprocity. Anyone who has been sexually conservative, or practiced safe sex, will be eager to get tested and then to share his or her card in order to be “rewarded” with similarly healthy partners. This will encourage frequent testing and card-sharing, thereby creating a self-enforcing equilibrium among healthy individuals.,Granted, anyone who has already contracted an STD will hesitate to share results. But withholding the card, in and of itself, is still good information. Even though we’re supposed to respect people who “plead the Fifth,” choosing not to share could reasonably be interpreted as a signal of higher risk. The message would be obvious, and the would-be partner could decide in turn whether or not to withhold sex.,Interestingly, individuals who already suffer from STDs will also be better off. They will benefit directly by being able to identify partners who share their disease. Some of the most conscientious of those suffering from STDs currently self-select similarly infected partners through internet dating sites like stdmatch.net. More generally, with additional incentives to get tested, curable STDs can be caught and treated in earlier stages, thereby reducing the likelihood of serious complications including infertility, cancer, and higher susceptibility to the ravages of HIV (S.O. Aral, “Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Magnitude, Determinants, and Consequences,” International Journal of STD and AIDS 12, no. 4 (2001): 211-215).,This system would also engender positive externalities, benefiting more than just those directly involved in the coupling. First, reducing the spread of STDs will reduce the risks not only for couples who choose to share cards, but also for every one of their future potential partners—and, of course, for each of those future partners’ future partners, ad infinitum. Second, notwithstanding the incalculable reduction in human suffering, the card system will reduce the medical costs of treating STDs, both because the rate of infection will fall, and because more testing will catch STDs at earlier stages, when they are generally less expensive to treat. The Center for Disease Control reports that the national cost of treating STDs is currently about $14.1 billion annually—all for diseases that are, in theory, 100 percent avoidable. ,When it comes to our sexual health, we should all be risk averse. Thus, by reducing unnecessary and unwanted risk, this system will boost utility. In a world that approaches sex as rationally as it approaches business, the best new pickup line just might be, “Show me your card, and I’ll show you mine.”  Now that’s sexy.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/sexonomics/,"

"The Democratic Party has promised the electorate change, but is not always clear about what this will mean in practice.  There is Obama change with its emphasis on bipartisanship, and there is Big Momma change with its emphasis on taking back the country for liberals.  The first kind is an easier case to make to the American people, but it is the second kind that might actually make life better for them. The question becomes one of which candidate is more likely to unite these messages of change and push a liberal agenda in a constructive way. As it is, compromise and unity are gaining currency as buzzwords, but the party is jeopardizing its standing as an ideological institution. Change means different things for different people, and the more it becomes a message of bipartisanship, the less effective it becomes as a rallying cry for Democrats and independents who actually want to change policy.  Hilary is unlikely to unite the country, but can Obama win armed only with a vision of cooperation?  Will this cooperation compromise Democratic values?  The situation at present seems to be working in Obama’s favor, but for him to seriously challenge the Republicans in the fall he needs a liberal platform.,The problem with the kum bi ya kind of game is that bipartisanship is necessarily a two-way street.  The prospect of fighting John McCain in a general election leaves Democrats in an uncomfortable position.  McCain is a civil, intelligent, and well-respected public servant.  Insofar as voters are looking to escape the stink of partisanship, he is as valid a choice as Obama or Clinton as at numerous points in his Senate career he has crossed party lines.  If changing Washington means only changing the way Democrats and Republicans talk to one another, if it just means unity and bipartisanship, then perhaps McCain is the best candidate.  Just as he is tactful in pushing his foreign policy vision, Democrats must be sure of where they stand on issues and keep them at the forefront of national discourse.,There are certainly ways to paint McCain as a purveyor of a dated and morally bankrupt ideology, but Democrats must be very careful about how and when they do it.  They would do better to counter him with a positive message. It would require no great effort on their part to point out McCain’s Islamophobia and link it to an aggressive defense policy that will only imitate the most egregious blunders of the Bush administration. If one can get past McCain’s irritating rhetorical habit of referring to everyone in earshot as “My friends,” one will hear alarming predictions that border on promises. “There will be other wars,” he says.  Does he mean that if war doesn’t come of its own accord that he’ll start one himself?  Just as he was unpopular for supporting the surge, he may again dig his own grave if he can be goaded into threatening Syria or Iran directly.,While such concerns about McCain are well justified, Democrats should think twice before adopting this line of argument.  If there is another terrorist attack or if Iran again seriously threatens U.S. forces as they did last month in the Straight of Hormuz, Democrats will be caught with their pants down.  And as Billy Bob Thornton memorably put it in ,, the 1998 film adaptation of Joel Klein’s novel about Clinton, “No one wants to die with their dick hanging out.”  The problem with McCain is that he sees no daylight between prevention and preemption, a serious moral concern.   However, if the United States is attacked, the distinction will appear academic at best and unpatriotic at worst.,The secret for the Democrats will not be to push McCain, but to advance a platform that embodies changing the course set by the Bush administration.  This will mean protecting the environment, funding research in alternative energy (and not just useless corn ethanol), funding education mandates, and fixing America’s grossly corrupt healthcare system.  For years, Republicans have set the agenda and Democrats have had to play dress up.  As countless liberal would-be Congressmen have learned, any time a fake Republican challenges a real one, odds are voters will take the real deal.  McCain’s record of voting against his party makes him a prime target on which to turn the tables.  This year it is the Democrats that have raised the money, bedazzled the media, and generally rocked the vote.  If voters can be made to believe that we can change not just the way we talk with those who disagree, but also fundamentally change the way we run the country, they will respond.,Senator Barack Obama appears to be the man to do it.  Obama outpolls Clinton in rural areas and the South, and it is not just the black vote.  There aren’t many blacks in Iowa.  Rather, Obama has campaigned in a way that does not alienated voters, particularly evangelicals.  Nicholas Kristof recently explored the possibility of the Democrats courting the evangelical vote in a New York Times op-ed piece, suggesting that this year the mega-churches will talk more about poverty here and AIDS abroad than about abortion.  If either Democratic candidate is able to talk about issues like homosexuality and abortion in a way that evangelicals can even remotely tolerate, then this election is over.  And it is no great mystery which candidate has had a better rapport with non-party-base voters.,There are two major problems with Hilary that have nothing to do with the way she dresses, when she cries, or whom else her husband has slept with.  First, it has often been remarked in the press that McCain and Senator Clinton might run a very civil race, as neither wishes to offend the many noses now allergic to the effluvium of “Washington” rancor. Moreover, as Senate colleagues the two have apparently gotten along famously, nowhere more so than in Estonia where the two had a friendly vodka drinking contest only a few years ago.  Being the polarizing figure that she is, Hillary is unlikely to pick up more undecideds than McCain, and a boring race will not change the equation.  The second problem is that they are too much alike for her to get a monopoly of attention or to control the agenda.  They are old, white, rich members of the establishment, and Hilary’s supposed foreign policy and defense experience will look absurd next to McCain’s, even to those who find his ideas disagreeable.  If anything, McCain will be the spokesman of bipartisanship in a Hilary-McCain race.,Enter Obama.  Picture Barack Obama and John McCain on the stage.  There you have a real contrast.  The young man and the old man.  The hopeful and the angry. And in Iraq, if one is to agree with most Americans today, the right and the wrong.  It is by no means won, but when you have a candidate who opposed the war from the beginning and a man who is willing to keep it up for a hundred years, at least you have a ball game.,The problem for the Democrats is that Obama could run out of things to say.  McCain’s Straight Talk Express has track in front of it for as long as money persists in politics or Islamic extremists continue to hate us.  These are actual issues next to which message of nothing but hope sound naïve and uninformed.  For the Democrats to seriously challenge McCain they must nominate Obama, and for Obama to win he must bring together hope , purpose, because they are not the same thing.  Democrats need to grab the microphone while it dangles in front of them and let Republicans play catch up.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/more_fighting_in_the_war_room/,"

"New Jersey dog owners and immigrant baiters breathed a sigh of relief last week as Congo the German shepherd dodged death. Less than 24 hours before his appeal was scheduled to be heard before Superior Court Judge Mitchel Ostrer, the pooch’s lawyer, Robert E. Lytle, cut a deal with prosecutor Doris Galuchie. As it turns out, the deal was quite a good one for Congo’s owners Guy and Elizabeth James–if by good, one means getting to keep with minimal penalties a violent dog one cannot control.,Last June, Congo and four much younger dogs mauled Honduran landscaper Giovanni Rivera, after the latter failed to heed a warning to remain in his vehicle while the dogs were secured. Congo charged Mr. Rivera, who proceeded to seek refugee behind Mrs. James. The dogs seem to have understood Mr. Rivera’s actions towards their mistress as threatening and provocative, because they succeeded in biting and scratching him for three minutes before the Jameses finally regained control of the situation. ,From June to November Congo lived in Animal Control quarantine while his family organized the legal battle that was to come. While simultaneously arguing that they were working in the dog’s best interests, the James family complained that Congo’s health deteriorated over the course of his incarceration. In November, the courts labeled Congo “vicious” and his accomplices “potentially dangerous,” as many suspected they would. Under New Jersey’s Vicious and Potentially Dangerous Dog Act, the former designation carries a minimum sentence of destruction and the latter an annual fine of $700 per dog, along with various safety provisions.,The Jameses decided to appeal the ruling, hoping to demonstrate to Superior Court judges that Congo had been reasonably provoked. Hundreds of letters of support on behalf of Congo descended upon Trenton’s judicial chambers and even on the steps of Drumthwacket. Governor Corzine indicated early on that he would not intervene in the case or offer the accused a pardon, but this did not stop the barrage of phone calls complaining of Congo’s unjust treatment under draconian law.,Unfortunately, many in the state have been drawn to this case not out of concern for Congo’s welfare, but out of fear and loathing of his victim. Early coverage of the incident reported that Giovanni Rivera was an illegal immigrant who, following scores of rabies shots, an operation and five days in hospital, received a large settlement from the Jameses’ homeowners insurance company. On the blogs and in the comments sections of the local rags, posters have been virulent in their criticism of Mr. Rivera.,Upon reading of the settlement at the news website NJ.com, a poster identified as TBOWOO9 shared the following with the reading public: “HAHAHAHAAAA THE STINKING ILLEGAL ALIEN was not invited or escorted onto the property by the owners…Deport that scumbag and hail the dog as a hero for recognizing what he actually was. An Invader.”,Concurring with these sentiments, dontazmebro added, “The dog should be required to speak spanish [sic], or at least “el barko.” This is indeed a depressing world if, after living among Spanish-speakers for so many years, the best Mr. Dontazmebro can come up with is “el barko.” The personal vitriol against Mr. Rivera in support of the Jameses boggles the mind, particularly when one considers the kinds of jobs many immigrants are compelled to take in this country and the tendency of America’s business elite to hire them.,The settlement reached late last Thursday dismissed with prejudice both the ruling against Congo and that against the four other dogs involved in the incident. In return, the Jameses pled guilty to Township Ordinance § 6-14, which prohibits dog owners from allowing their pets to bite people. This lesser charge carries a one-time $50 fee per dog, for a grand total of $250. Figure in Mr. Lytle’s fees, and the Jameses will have spent a pretty penny on their pets. ,According to the settlement papers, the James family is “in compliance with all aspects of the sentence imposed by the trial court, with the obvious exception of those requirements which have been stayed pending appeal. Essentially, the proposed settlement would maintain this status quo indefinitely.” In short, all five dogs will continue to be muzzled and leashed when outside of their fenced enclosure, the fence will continue to carry ‘beware of dog’ signs, and the state will have to be notified within 24 hours if one of the five dogs should die, be sold, run away or attack again. The only serious difference between this settlement and the one proposed months ago by the state is money. New Jersey had offered to spare Congo’s life on the condition that all five dogs be registered as potentially dangerous. In this settlement, the Jameses will not be required to “pay an annual potentially dangerous dog fee of $700 to the Township relating to Congo,,Lucia, Shadow, Bear or Hunter.”,Basically, the state weanied out. Had they lost, they would not have gotten any money out of this tragedy and would have opened a colossal can of worms vis-a-vis future interpretations of aggressive-canine law. More importantly, the Jameses would have borne no obligation to protect the public from their German shepherds. Following the announcement of the appeal, the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office issued the following statement on its website:,“Our goal in this case, as it is in every case, is to do what is in the best interest of justice and community safety. In particular, our objective was to ensure that the community is protected from vicious or potentially dangerous dogs. We believe that the settlement achieves that purpose. In the event that we lost the appeal, the State would have no legal authority to impose any safety restrictions regarding the dogs…”,On an emotional level, it is heart-warming to see Congo return to his family. One would hope, however, that as intelligent people we could see the bigger picture. The love we feel for our pets should extend to a love of one another and to a sense of concern for their safety. The bigotry expressed towards Mr. Rivera has been",http://www.nassauweekly.com/compromise-congo/,"

"It is hard to believe, but the eight years are almost over. For ninety-some months, Vladimir Putin has led his country though gruesome displays of terrorism, border crises, a dysfunctional pension system, and a generally decaying infrastructure. He has done it all despite a hailstorm of international criticism from both those who oppose his blunt foreign policy and those who question his exercise of enormous executive authority. And on Sunday, Russian voters will go to the polls to confirm his chosen heir to the throne, Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev.,It is the latter group of detractors on which this article will focus. Without denying the extent of the repressive mechanisms in Russia today, I shall argue that Western opposition to Putin is largely rooted in certain expectations that many held in the years between 1991 and 2000, which were irrational even at the time. The political narrative of democratic progress that observers hoped to pin on Russia was more a function of Beltway aspiration than of Red Square reality. Putin should be evaluated not by the expectations of Americans, but by the widespread approval he enjoys in Russia. Putin’s high degree of public approval is not inexplicable, and neither is it case that eighty-odd percent of Russians are somehow duped and eagerly awaiting the light of further Western commentary.  For reasons that are yet to be wholly explained, democracy (and only democracy as we practice it) is now widely considered to be the natural state of affairs, or in other words, one that is only absent under conditions of duress. Our trouble today in Iraq is slowly showing us that achieving democracy is a difficult process and one that must be willfully undertaken, but it is a lesson many think-tanks are slow to learn. Since Francis Fukuyama declared “Western liberal democracy” to be the end of history (a proto-Marxist conception of time if ever there was one), we have treated “free and fair” elections much as Aristotle treated gravity, as something so central to the human experience that any aberration is unnatural and, by definition, unjust. Journalists, highbrow and low-, tend to get stuck in this paradigm with astounding ease, and therefore consistently fail properly to analyze Russian social and political realities. There are even those local newspapers so besotted with themselves and their delusions of worldly acumen, that they print editorials entitled “Putin as Stalin”–as the Pittsburgh ,did in October of 2006. This really won’t do if we are to understand what Putin is up to, and why it is that he is so terribly popular. ,Sophisticates who recognize the limited utility of the Putin-Stalin trope tend to prefer a more Hitler-esque narrative. Stanford’s Michael McFaul and his minions of American political scientists are particularly complicit in this Weimar Russia scheme that paints Putin as a despoiler of a society otherwise destined for democratic glory. Much of the academic literature written about Putin, usually under the dubious pretenses of so-called political science, focuses solely on his authoritarianism and treats it like bloodstain on a white silk handkerchief. In this school of rhetoric, which I shall call the Palo Alto School, the Yeltsin and Putin administrations are both described with verbs that denote transition. These authors argue that Yeltsin brought the country up out of everything bad and into the free pastures of everything good. Yeltsin led the people from autocracy to democracy, from planning to markets. Next they claim that Putin, out of a lust for personal power and unsatiated Cold War ambitions, descended upon Moscow and ruined everything. This is utter nonsense. The best that might be said of McFaul is that he hedges his bets, and when his assessment of the Yeltsin years is put under scrutiny, he will craft the subtle argument that it is in fact possible to “have good and bad things happen at the same time.” I focus on Yeltsin here, because the key to understanding Putin’s place in history lies in the chaos he inherited. At Yeltsin’s funeral last April, former President Bill Clinton opined that Yeltsin may have had some rough patches but that “history will be kind to him because he was courageous.” Perhaps Yeltsin was courageous that day when he scrambled up on the tank, but he really made a mess of things in the years after. Yeltsin was an alcoholic with a failing heart; moreover, he was an alcoholic who was afforded the power of lawmaking-by-decree so as to bypass legislative opposition. Let us not forget that the power of arbitrary dictatorship was a step down from his previous method of controlling the people’s deputies, which was to shell them with live rounds of tank ammo as he did in 1993. Where his regime was not totally corrupt, it was totally incompetent. He sold Russia’s vast natural resources for a song, built almost no new democratic infrastructure, and failed to reign in crime.  Even Stalin, in the words of many of my Russian friends, “got things done.” American history books will be good to Yeltsin. But the Russian people have about as much chance of warming up to him as we do to Stalin.,Understanding post-Soviet politics requires understanding Yeltsin as a Russian paradigm. Yeltsin’s fatal flaw was not that of corruption, capriciousness or authoritarianism. Rather, Yeltsin’s most egregious sins were his failure to impose order, failure to beat obstacles into submission, and failure to provide for the basic welfare of Russians, a social expectation that largely defined Soviet identity until 1991. He led Russia at its meekest, but did nothing extraordinary to fortify it. Albeit by questionable means, Putin has restored order and delivered prosperity. More than this, he has done it in a way that has unified the Russian people and the language of political discourse. Many Western observers see this monopoly over political discourse as a facet of oppression, but that reading does not capture the issue at hand. Such observers ignore at their own peril the degree to which many Russians seek comfort in the forms of hegemonic discourse channeled through Moscow and the television news. After the collapse, a multiplicity of political discourses emerged, each backed by its own narrow interests, each supported or rejected by foreign interlocutors, and each locked in conflict with one another. The onslaught of articulated interests overwhelmed voters, as scores of political parties registered, interest groups formed, and candidates competed openly. In the first legislative elections, nearly a quarter of the voters threw up their hands in protest and voted for the most theatrical and clownish discourse available. The so-called Liberal Democratic Party, which carried the constituency of despair, proposed among other things to invade India and to reclaim Alaska. Another 4.36% voted against all of the candidates.  This rush of plurality failed to address the underlying economic inequalities that affected Russian workers and their families. Rather than providing a means to promote lasting change, the bitter competition between moneyed interests highlighted the fragmentation of national discourse and–by extension–of national identity. By stifling dissent Putin has created a narrative of power and prosperity of which the vast majority of Russians are proud. By renationalizing the resource industries and pumping the money, in the manner of Russia’s predecessor state, back into social welfare and the domestic economy, Putin has improved the quality of life and restored solid political identity. Self-identification in Russia is fundamentally tied to, though is by no means an exclusive function of, politics. Caroline Humphrey suggests that the relationship between space and ruler is best exemplified in the morphology of the terms themselves. The word for household or domain, ,, is inseparable from the word for proprietor, ,. The Russian word for state, ,, is not derived from anything comparable to Latin’s ,, is not as Michael Herzfeld points out “that which has always existed,” but rather is tied to word for sovereign, ,.’ Spaces are defined by the offices that lead them. The hierarchy of power from peasant to ,to God was shifted by modernity and the Soviet experience, but its linear structure persists. This kind of outward expression of power in Russia is predicable. Successful ruling is about the ability to structure the institutions beneath the ruler. It would be condescending to assert that this outward power relationship is the whole picture; of course it is not. In the mind of the subject, the comrade, or the citizen, questions of power and subservience are far more complicated, but it is worth remembering that it was not Serbian-style revolution that brought down the Soviet Union. Private dissent, caustic jokes, critical kitchen-table discussions, the desire for self-expression and the circulation of *samizdat’* (forbidden texts) prior to , did not undermine the Soviet Empire. They were simply means of coping with a reality that few expected to seriously change. Rather, internal economic forces and the loosening of ideological controls by Gorbachev destabilized the régime. It was the awakening of a post-war, urban, educated generation–cut off both from Bolshevik optimism and from upward social mobility into the Union’s geriatric cadres–that forced the center to reevaluate the purpose of the party and the plausibility of the Union.,In other words, the collapse of the Soviet Union was not a full rejection of its underlying system of power relationships as much as it was an abandonment of one form of its expression. Prevailing Western depictions of Yeltsin paint him as a flag-bearer for democracy, though most assuredly he was not. As described earlier, many Russians were less concerned about his power to rule by decree or his shelling of the parliament, than they were perturbed by the degree to which he destabilized everything,his constitutional authority. Russia of the 1990s was a period marked by the ludicrously unjust reallocations of state (the peoples’) assets, rapid inflation, ruble collapse, and a general lack of order memorably described to me by a professor in the Slavic Department as the ,, or the festive nightmare.,From out of this chaos, described only by CNN as improvement, came Vladimir Putin and–frankly–the West did not know what to make of him, though perhaps they should have known. In the summer of 2000, PBS’s Gwen Ifill asked McFaul to describe the importance or unimportance of Putin’s historical position as the first Russian leader born after the Second World War. His response: , This is as ideological a reading of even the simplest facts as anything Democrats accuse Bush of perpetrating in Iraq. It is striking just how wrong McFaul was on every count. Yeltsin at least had the courtesy to join politics as an ,(a machine politician, a bureaucrat). Putin preferred contract killing–espionage, the life of a , (an agent of the state security forces). Needless to say, McFaul now faults Putin for his reliance on “Soviet bureaucrats and KGB apparatchiks,” but unless he was delusional, why did he ever expect Putin to behave otherwise? Putin was very much a man of the Soviet KGB, despite his less-than-exhilarating career assignment in Dresden. After the collapse he headed the FSB under Yeltsin, the successor group to the KGB. The security services were always a channel of upward mobility in Russia, and it is naïve to think that that has changed. The, (the members of the security services) now control as much as a quarter of the top positions in the Putin government, according to one Princeton political scientist’s estimates.,As for consulting “market reformers” one only need consider the popularity of those like Anatoly Borisovich Chubais, the false prophet of shock therapy and privatization guru of the earlier Yeltsin years. In response to a roadside ambush by professionals with automatic weapons in 2005, Chubais claimed that he had just escaped the fourth attempt on his life. Chubais, former Prime Minister Yegor Timurovich Gaidar, and their right-hand man–the thoroughly discredited Harvard economist Andrei Shleifer–are some of the most hated men in Russia today. They do not carry much clout in Putin’s inner circle these days, despite retaining the enormous wealth they garnered through their exploits.,The story of Shleifer is worth a brief aside. In April of 2004, along with Daniel Treisman, he published an article on Russia in ,under the dubious title of “A Normal Country.” They write, “Yet data on Russia’s growth, macroeconomic stability, income inequality, and corporate finances–as well as on its elections, press freedom, and corruption–suggest there is a large gap between the overwhelmingly negative assessments of the country and the facts.” As it turned out, the gap was lager than that between Shleifer’s pen and his wallet. A few months after the article went to print, a federal judge ruled that both Harvard and Shleifer could be held liable for damages relating to an ongoing case between the United States Agency for International Development, which funded his research, and the university. Shleifer and his wife, as it turned out, had much to gain from the rosy assessments they “objectively” reported, and Harvard ended up footing a bill of nearly USD 27 million as a result of the Shleifer family’s Russian investments. Behold the power of tenure; Sheifer was not fired, but was stripped of his former title as the “Whipple V.N. Jones Professor of Economics.”  Contrary to McFaul’s initial prediction and much to his followers’ collective consternation, Putin has pursued aggressively anti-democratic policies since taking office. Backed by the ,, he has renationalized much of what the oligarchs won during the loans-for-shares debacle, and has even pursed some former tycoons into the courtroom. Mikhail Khordokovsky, the former head of the oil company Yukos, remains in prison in remote Chita where he is serving a long sentence for what many considered to be politically-motivated tax evasion charges. More than a dozen journalists, many critical of the government, have been murdered during Putin’s tenure; however, despite the lethargy of Russian prosecutors, there is not evidence that suggests government complicity in the deaths. Finally, Putin has overseen a radical overhaul of Russian’s federalist system. Regional governors are now appointed to their positions, and there is strong evidence to suggest that a governor’s autonomy is directly related to the ballot results for Putin he is able to produce. In no way should modern Russia be considered a liberal democracy. Flash forward to the present. On Sunday, the ,launched what promises to be a multipart series of articles under the banner, ,. The first article focuses on Nizhny Novgorod and the bullying tactics local officials have used to drive up the vote tally for Putin’s party United Russia. Unprecedentedly, the article was published online in Russian, before it appeared in print in America. The ,has committed itself to cataloguing and translating Russian readers’ comments through a partnership with the internet service Live Journal. Many of the commentators expressed frustration at the at the article’s tone, which was widely perceived as paternalistic. In words of a reader, screen named ,, “I read the first paragraph and it was enough. Sort out everything in your democracy first.”  Or as ,puts it: , (translations by the ,).  ,The basic problem seems to be that most Russians do not find the conduct of Putin’s administration to be abhorrent, and even those who do, do not wish to hear it from us. This should not be a surprise. Fairly or not, many Russians associate American interference during the 1990s with the economic turbulence they experienced. Democracy, or whatever that meant under Yeltsin, has become a punch-line. According to a poll conducted last October by the Russian group VTsIOM, Russians have little knowledge of the current crop of business elite, but know well the names of Khordokovsky and of former media-mogul turned Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky. American foreign policy with Putin’s Russia was flawed from the start. President Bush’s first meeting with Putin is remembered for Bush’s extraordinary presumptuousness. In 2001, Bush purported, with no outward evidence of intoxication, to have peered “into Putin’s soul.” Almost worse, he claimed to have liked what he saw. Russians were taken aback by the incident, as in Russia, looking into the soul is a strange concept. The idea of a Russian soul is something profoundly deep, and no one would ever talk about it with such flippant disregard. Since then, the Bush administration has whistled a different tune. Now the strategy is to criticize and preach at every opportunity, with no regard for how negatively such comments are received by the Russian people. ,Frankly, American prospects are not good. Adopting the ploy of categorical opposition to everything Bush says, no matter how unworthy of further comment, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton argued that Putin has no soul because, “he was a KGB agent.” In a similar remark, presidential hopeful John McCain asserted, “I looked into his eyes and saw three letters: a K, a G and a B.” Our only hope for a President who will not worsen the Russian situation is Barack Obama. Obama has not yet met the outgoing President of Russia, and has refrained from appraising his soul.,Even if Putin continues to pull the strings in Moscow, we need to adopt a new approach with Medvedev. Putin was not an inexplicable phenomenon, his effect on the country was not as bad as our pundits insist, and it is undeniable that the standard of living in Russia has increased enormously. It is time to let go of the Palo Alto School of moral superiority and to work with Russian in a respectful way. Internal Russian politics are beyond our control and are more complicated than we are willing to admit. We need to accept, as McFaul so blandly put it, that “good and bad things happen at the same time.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/ido_svidaniyai_putin/,"

Then we got the all-star team in charge of those different organizations, General McChrystal and all the others; we worked with them, they developed the concepts for the campaign that are necessary. Then President Obama committed the additional resources that are necessary to enable it, and they’re flowing: 5,000 of the 30,000 [soldiers] are already in country, and Marja is the first, the initial effort, the initial operation in what will be a campaign that stretches out over the course of this year and even into 2011, the objectives of which will be indeed to increase the security for the Afghan people, particularly in key areas and along key lines of communication [1], and then to enable the development of Afghan governance—local governance, a lot of it in traditional ways, familiar to the Afghan people, but governance nonetheless [2]—that can resolve disputes and that can, over time, ensure better services for the Afghan people, revive local markets and indeed help them achieve, over time, a better life for themselves and for their families.,NN: So Hamid Karzai won a hotly contested election, but he was accused of manipulating votes and placing his tribe above other tribes. Are there risks with negotiating separate peace agreements with smaller leaders and do they undermine the central government?,GP: Well, first of all, it’s accurate to observe, as you did, that the election did not result in the greater legitimacy that was indeed hoped would be an outcome of that particular election for the incoming President, in this case, of course, President Karzai being reelected and his government. But, obviously, you have to work through that, and it is absolutely essential over time that, again, Afghan governance be seen as legitimate in the eyes of the people. It cannot therefore be corrupt, it can’t be predatory governance, it has to help them achieve a better life and achieve a better life for their family members as well. Certainly the negotiations with elements of the insurgency that could be reconciled, that could be reintegrated back into society, with tribes that aren’t necessarily the ones in power, all of this will be carried out with the Afghan government, not independent from it, and it’s essential that that be the case.,NT: In a speech on September 17, 2009, you said, “it’s also necessary to find ways to identify the reconcilable members of the insurgent elements.” My question is, how does the military distinguish between those who are willing to give up their arms and turn sides versus the so-called “hard-core” warriors?,GP: Well, you just mentioned one way. They literally lay down their arms, they literally come in and talk with our Afghan partners and ISAF [International Security Assistant Force, a NATO-affiliated group working in Afghanistan] element leaders, and they have to demonstrate a sincere desire to be reintegrated into the population, to become part of the solution instead of a continuing part of the problem. It is difficult to make these decisions, as it was in Iraq, and it is also difficult to bring yourself to sit across the table, if you will, or sit around drinking chai with individuals who may have been trying to kill us, but that’s how you, that’s how you reduce insurgencies [3]. You can’t kill or capture your way out of an industrial-strength insurgent problem; you do have to do some of that, without question, and indeed we are bringing in more of our so-called Special Mission Units to do just that. But we are also working to develop more Afghan forces, we are working to empower Afghan people through local defense initiatives, so we’re working across the board in a very comprehensive effort, that one element of which is this so-called reintegration of reconcilables [4].,NN: Do you think that the Afghan military is in a better position to identify who is a potential to be reintegrated and who needs to be captured or killed?,GP: In most cases, yes. Certainly in the cases where, of course, you have trustworthy partners, we can—we sometimes joke and say we can do all the cultural awareness and language training in the world and we’ll never, ever reach the levels of the locals [5]—and that’s obviously very true. So when you have good partners, certainly they are critical to the reintegration process, as it’s termed in Afghanistan, of reconcilable elements; but they have to demonstrate a level of integrity in this process, they have to show fairness, there has to be openness, and it cannot be a case where the Afghan leader is helping his own tribe or his own people; he has to indeed be objective about this, as much as is possible. [6],NT: This morning, you were talking about drone warfare in the Afghan war and I’d like to touch on this point for just a moment. Do you see drone warfare as a tool that helps the U.S. Army because it doesn’t put soldiers in harm’s way and it achieves tactical victories, or do you see it sometimes as a hindrance, because of the civilian causalities that arise and therefore become propaganda victories, for example, the way there was a propaganda victory in Fallujah in 2004?,GP: Well, first of all, what I was talking about was not just drone warfare at all. What I was talking about was the use of close air support: it can be fixed-wing manned aircraft, B-1s, F-16s, F-15s, you name it; it can be unmanned aerial vehicles that are armed and also have full-motion video; it can be attack helicopters; it can even be indirect fire from artillery, multiple rocket launchers and so forth. So it’s any means of these very lethal systems that can, if not employed properly, can cause innocent civilian loss of life. And indeed, in war, there will be innocent loss of civilian life [7], but our objective is to keep that to an absolute minimum, without tying our soldiers’ hands behind their backs, but to make sure that we don’t give the enemy a propaganda tool, and that is, again, innocent civilians killed in the course of operations by our weapons, if at all possible. And indeed, actually with unmanned aerial vehicles the record is very, very impressive. Speaking in a generic sense, not in any particular campaign now, unmanned aerial vehicles typically are very precise; you have full-motion vision of what’s going on in the situation before the trigger is pulled, if you will, and the weapons tend to be relatively small in relation to, say, larger bombs—although we have some now that can even carry quite substantial bombs, all of them though being precision munitions. So, in fact, unmanned aerial vehicles are extraordinarily useful; they have a substantial dwell time [air time][8] and as you layer these and package them, you can get what’s called the unblinking eye [9]: you can just stare at a location and really gain a knowledge of a pattern of life as it’s called [10], that is so substantial that you can then pull the trigger and take out a bad guy [11] with a good degree of confidence that there are no innocent civilians in a location.,NN: In 2007, China was accused of hacking Pentagon systems. Is cybersecurity an increasing threat and how does the military plan to respond?,GP: Well, we’re working very hard at defenses in cyberspace. The enemy is active in cyberspace in a number of different ways, various enemies and indeed just plain hackers, if you will, as well, that can nonetheless cause significant damage if they carry out attacks in certain systems. But we’ve worked very hard to erect defenses in cyberspace. There are literally, I think it’s tens or hundreds of thousands of intrusions per day, or attempted intrusions into our secure and non-secure networks—again, attempts—and we have to work very, very hard to protect our systems and to ensure that individuals can’t get in those and exploit that opening that they achieve.,NT: In 2009, Kevin Chilton, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said, “I don’t think you take anything off the table when you provide options,” in response to a cyber attack. Can you, first, give a scenario that would prompt military action and the second question is, in the example of China, at what point does one consider hacks directed by the Chinese government indistinguishable from hacks done by individual citizens of China?,GP: Well, first of all, I am not sure how granular the evidence is, or, in fact if I did, I’m not sure I would talk about it here, in terms of what we see different countries or citizens of different countries doing. There’s no question that we know where substantial numbers of these hacking efforts come from, these cyber intrusions. There are certainly suspicions that in some cases they are being actively aided and abetted by governmental agencies, although it’s not always crystal clear, in certain cases. But what is clear is that we have to work very hard, harder in fact than we have in the past, increasingly to erect those defenses and General Chilton, who is the head of Strategic Command, indeed has a subordinate element that does network defenses and so on, and that is hugely important.,NT: I’d like to briefly change tracks just because we’re kind of pressed for time, and I’d like to ask you a question with regards to Iraq and Iran. The first question is, in a February 17th Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kimberly and Frederick Kagan claimed, “Iranian senior leaders actively attempt to undermine the democratic, secular and cross-sectarian political process.” How significant is the political and military threat posed to Iraq by Iran and what is the U.S. doing to address it?,GP: Well, there’s no question that Iran has, over the years, continued to arm, train, fund, equip and even direct, in some cases, militant extremist elements inside Iraq. These have been militia members, currently the elements are Asaib al-Haq—although that’s reconciled by and large—Qutb Hezbollah [12], the Promised Day Brigade, and some others. And these indeed continue to carry out attacks on a daily basis with signature weapons provided by Iran, specifically the explosively-formed projectiles, certain calibers of rockets, and some other weapons that are employed, and that’s—obviously that is of concern, but it’s not just of concern to us, it’s of concern to the Iraqi people and to Iraqi leaders as well, who do not welcome a neighbor meddling in their affairs, causing security issues, and in some cases attempting to manipulate political activities either. [13],NN: In a January interview with CNN, you said that Centcom had been thinking about various what-ifs and making plans for a whole variety of different contingencies. What considerations are taken into account when determining whether to proceed with military action?,GP: Well, what I was getting at—you know I was asked, tell me about your plans for taking out Iran’s nuclear weapons, and obviously I wasn’t on a Sunday show going to lay out specifically what it is that we might be planning or might not be planning. What I did say, as you correctly conveyed, is that it would be irresponsible if we were not asking certain what-ifs and if we were not making contingency plans. That’s what military commanders get paid to do. I think the country expects the geographic combatant commanders like myself to do just that, and to prepare for some of these different what-ifs. But we don’t then go out and, you know, explicitly talk about them. We do, in certain cases want, certainly, to support diplomacy; it is useful at times to know that certain defensive actions have been taken and certain precautions, and even preparations, for other activities may have been made, but that’s where we generally want to leave it.,NN: If President Obama were to shelve his diplomatic approach, would it be feasible for the military to remove the Iranian threat?,GP: Well, before that certainly, what we have certainly pursued, what the United States has pursued over the course of the past year has been the engagement track and it’s worked very hard at this; and I think at the end of the day, as the emphasis is now put on what’s called the pressure track, there can be no question about the willingness of the United States to reach out an open hand, as the saying goes, to make efforts to sit down and talk, without preconceptions, with Iran; and indeed in each case, Iran has not answered that in the manner to which we offered. So the result is that now the emphasis is shifting to the so-called pressure track, to the efforts by the UN Security Council, and many countries beyond the United States—Russia has expressed concerns, as well, about Iranian nuclear activities. The countries together are examining what kind of additional instruments, in terms of sanctions and so forth, should be applied, and I think that’s very much the appropriate course at this time, indeed while the military does make whatever prudent preparations we should be making to answer the what-ifs, if it should ever come to that.,NT: You touched on the subject of sanctions—Russia, which used to be against sanctions, has now become more in favor of it—however the US has still run into opposition from the Chinese at the Security Council in being able to implement sanctions. How much more effort until the US considers sanctions a failed option?,GP: Well, first of all, we’re still in the somewhat early days of determining what sanctions can and should be implemented and indeed, let’s not just cast this as the United States. There are numerous other countries, very important countries in the world, that are also concerned and…they are also working with all of the different members of the Security Council and indeed other countries around the world; and so there are other countries also certainly having dialogue and will have dialogue with China, with Russia, again, with all of the different partners in this effort.,NT: General, we’d like to ask a couple broader questions about the war on terrorism and radical Islam. It can be argued that the most significant foreign threat to the US today arises from extremist Islam. What therefore is the role of the US military in combating an ideology?,GP: Well, the military has substantial information operations activities, particularly in a place like Iraq, Afghanistan, even more broadly at Central Command, that we work together with the State Department and the other organs of the U.S. government to employ in a coordinated fashion—with the Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, specifically, and with others. So that is an important role. Beyond that, we have very active engagement efforts: we also invite thousands of students from countries in the region to the United States for professional military education courses, and of course tens of thousands come to attend various civilian education courses as well. So there’s very substantial involvement in terms of not just the participation in the public arena and…augmenting and supporting public diplomacy efforts, but also just in the activities that we carry out in building relationships and indeed in building the regional security architecture. All of that has a place in the effort to combat the forces of extremism that indeed do pose such a threat to the countries in the region and to our homeland as well.,NN: So how, in your opinion, would you define success in both Afghanistan and Iraq?,GP: Well, I think most simply put: it’s that you can hand off to the countries’ leadership, to their security forces the tasks that in many cases we have performed in the past. That process is actually quite well along in Iraq: that’s what has enabled our drawdown from some hundred and sixty-five or so thousand U.S. forces and other coalition forces during the surge, down to now ninety-six thousand four hundred most recently and will enable the further reduction to somewhere around fifty thousand or so by the end of August this year. And a change in our mission from that of conducting combat operations—albeit now generally in support of Iraqi forces—to one that is explicitly an advise-and-assist mission as we indeed endeavor to help our Iraqi partners. It’s very similar in Afghanistan, although we’re obviously further from that point at which we can begin the process of transitioning tasks to Afghan forces and begin what President Obama has described as a responsible drawdown of our forces.,NT: Well, that will conclude our interview with General Petraeus. General, thank you for interviewing with us. It’s been an honor and, once again, congratulations on receiving the Madison Medal and best of luck to you.,NN: Thank you, General.,GP: Thanks, Nick and Naomi.,Aaron Smargen: General, congratulations again on receiving the James Madison medal.,General Petraeus: Thanks very much, Aaron.,AS: In your remarks this morning, you spoke of the importance of “intellectual soldiers, who can think as well as fight.” Reflecting back on your time as a student at both West Point and at Princeton, what civilian aspects of higher education prepared you for military leadership as well as for challenges on the battlefield?,GP: Indeed, what we’re trying to develop in the military, especially now given the challenges of the endeavors we have in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, which aren’t just about offense and defense, they’re also about stability and support operations. We’re trying to develop so-called pentathlete leaders, if you will. Again, individuals who can do more than just conventional combat operations but can also do the nation-building aspects that have been such important components of the efforts in those countries. [14] Now, what helps when you go to civilian education—civilian graduate school as I was privileged to do here at the Woodrow Wilson School—I think, first of all, is just an awareness that there are some really bright folks out there that don’t necessarily see the world the same way that we do: that’s very salutary when you end up operating in cultures that are very different from our own, with individuals who have different religions, different languages, different social traditions and all the rest of that; and then also certainly the challenges to thinking critically about topics. And I enumerated, of course, today, a number of these different attributes that Princeton, I think, successfully develops in the bulk of its graduates. And so that’s very important as well.,AS: Speaking of critical thinking, in your Princeton dissertation, “the American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam,” you wrote, “for the military, the debate about how and when to commit American troops abroad, has become a debate over how to avoid, at all costs, another Vietnam.” How much longer will the United States, and indeed the U.S. Military, remain in the shadow of Vietnam?,GP: Well, it depends how these ongoing operations turn out, I think. Frankly, there are some who felt that the lessons of Vietnam and the Vietnam experience were buried in the sands of Kuwait, with Operation Desert Storm, but then you have the experience in Somalia, you had some other protracted peace-enforcement operations in the Balkans and Kosovo and so forth, and that reawakened, for some, at least, various aspects of the Vietnam experience and the lessons that some took from it. The fact is that while lessons of history are hugely important, they can often obfuscate as well as illuminate. They can—history doesn’t repeat itself. It is certainly hugely important to study it, to try to glean what you can from it, but then to realize, I think, that the first lesson about lessons of history is that every situation is unique, it has its own context, its own specific circumstances and situation and the key is to understand those specifics with such granularity that you can apply the general lessons from past experiences in a manner that is sensible for that particular location in that particular operation.,AS: Another enduring effect of the Vietnam War has been the banning of on-campus ROTCs at private universities across the United States, including Princeton’s sister Ivy League institutions, Columbia and Harvard. What do you believe has been the impact of such policies, demographically, symbolically, or otherwise?,GP: Well, I mean its practical effect has been that probably fewer Harvard students are in ROTC than would be certainly if it were on-campus and my hope is that over the course of the years ahead that we’ll see ROTC return there. For what it’s worth, I actually was privileged to commission the eight Harvard students who were part of ROTC detachments elsewhere in Cambridge, Massachusetts, including the one our son was part of at MIT. And there were about 2,000 Harvard alumni there in that audience and family members for these eight students; and I think it was—they were there to make a statement, frankly, to show that they did believe that ROTC should come back to the campus. My hope is that the issues surrounding all that can be resolved in the years ahead, so that you can—you know, we want our very best to have an opportunity to serve, to take advantage of ROTC scholarships and so forth, for those that want to, just as Princeton students are able to do. And Princeton indeed has, I think, the best ROTC program in America and it was a privilege to spend time with them yesterday and run with a handful of the ROTC cadets here this morning.,AS: Could you comment on what you think it would take to reverse these bans?,GP: Well, in some cases of course, it’s wrapped up with the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, so we’ll see if that law is changed in the course of the year or years ahead and I certainly think that would remove that which is used as in some cases, perhaps a sincere obstacle, and in other perhaps not, but that would remove that particular issue from the equation.,AS: And one final question, General. What twenty-first century challenges do you anticipate that the United States will face in terms of military and public service recruitment? And how can we as a nation work to overcome them?,GP: Well, I think it is important that all segments of society, in a sense, share burdens and also share the privilege of serving our country in uniform. I was privileged to have some extraordinary Ivy League graduates—some of which again, went to other ROTC programs or to the Officer Candidate School—serving with us there in Iraq. And they were true national assets. I would hope that all students, again, at least would have that opportunity and would be exposed to some who are pursuing that particular course. But as President Tilghman rightly observed today, in fact, as I offered during my Baccalaureate address last spring, there are a number of different ways to serve our nation, to live the unofficial motto of Princeton, in the nation’s service and in the service of all nations. And indeed you can certainly argue that perhaps, it is more important to have someone serve our nation by inventing a new cure for some disease than perhaps it is to be in a particular executive branch department. Again, there are many avenues for service to our nation and I think that Princeton prepares its graduates admirably to follow a number of those different avenues.,AS: Thank you so much, General Petraeus, and again, congratulations on receiving the James Madison Medal today.,GP: Thanks, Aaron.,[1] This “security for” appears dependent on “key lines of communication”; these must be lines “between.” Security, in other words, depends in this construction on the existence of a communication network, national in scope. How such a framework stands in relation to a tribal society remains to be seen.,[2] The tension under which Petraeus evidently strains here—that traditional governance is “governance nonetheless”—is a product of the overextension of Western power, to the point that it comes to rely on the very forms of non-Western sovereignty it displaced (as illegitimate) or dismissed (as insufficient). (For more on the dismissal, including the trope of “ungovernable spaces,” see Shelagh Weir’s ,),[3] N.B. “Insurgencies” appears here without “insurgents.” Whether abstract, as here, or chemical—as below in “industrial-strength insurgent problem”—the problem solved by countersurgency is never a human one in military rhetoric.,[4] We’ve moved, now, from “reconciled” to “reconcilable” to “reconcilables.” What began as an American activity (v.) moved through an Afghan condition (adj.) to an essence (n.). To speak of “reconcilables,” rather than “reconcilable agents,” is to transform a form of diplomatic exchange between rational parties reconciliation—into a question of evaluating and, in a sense, , docile parties. Note too that “reconcilables” must be “reintegrated”—having been, in their essential difference, placed outside the boundaries of Afghan society.,[5] Absent the joke in question—which we suspect Petraeus withheld with good reason—we may not comment on the efficacy of a training regimen in “cultural awareness” that still allows one to speak of the only intermittently trustworthy “locals.” It is revealing that the issue of culture clash came up only in the context of identifying “who is a potential to be reintegrated and who needs to be captured or killed”; surely, the majority of Afghanis tracked by America’s unblinking eye desire neither reintegration nor death—may, in fact, be women and children supporting the insurgency in roles which cannot be understood without a cultural awareness broader than the one supported by the dichotomy set up here.,[6] Just as security was predicated on a network of national communication, earlier, so does it depend here upon the existence of a national interest: one that appears, in its foreign application, is posited as antithetical to the local interests endemic to representative government (e.g., earmarks).,[7] A Freudian slip; correcting for the parapraxis, one may read “loss of innocent civilian life.” As the repressed moral logic of counterinsurgency comes to the fore, we see the two categories of killing: innocent, and intended. The domestic, intermediary category of manslaughter has not been exported.,[8] “Dwell time” typically refers to the time a soldier spends at home, on leave. Leaving aside its identity between machine and man, this construction thus situates the drone’s home in enemy territory.,[9] For more, see , by Jeremy Bentham: a blueprint for a hypothetical prison that provides for total surveillance to ensure complete obedience.,[10] “The unblinking eye” is capable of perceiving not simply movement, but “a pattern of life.” What Bentham proscribed as a mode of imprisonment here comes to encompass every aspect of a civilian’s daily activity—without having even interned that civilian within four walls. Such total surveillance saturates the nation: filling (and extending beyond) its borders, claiming in its purview even the identity (“pattern of life”) of its citizens.,[11] The War on Terror’s “evildoers” has become “Af-Pak’s” “bad guys,” as the , gives way to the ,[12] , could not confirm this name’s referent.,[13] Neighbors meddle; Old Europe colonized; America develops. By speaking on behalf of the Iraqi “people… and leaders as well,” Petraeus adopts the most effective trope of a larger colonialist discourse: the assumption of knowledge of what is best for the group whose sovereignty has just been violently abrogated by the colonizers. Luckily, Western superpowers are not neighbors, and so they do not meddle.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/reconcilables/,"

"It is with tremendous sadness that I report on the passing of a great American hero. On February 26, 2010, the Hummer passed away in Sichuan Tengzheng’s botched attempt to purchase the brand from General Motors. The Hummer was born in its first incarnation in 1979, either as the result of the United States’ need for a new combat vehicle, or the mating of Roger Ebert and a Panzer Tank, no one is really sure. Having served as a powerful asset in the Gulf War, as a reliable ally in the warzone that is L.A. traffic, the Hummer had in many ways come to represent all that this country stood for at the time of its death: gluttonous excess, wide girth, and looking down on all the little people be- ing crushed by your forty inch chrome spinners.,Designated the High Mo- bility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), some of the Humvee’s original accessories included an M2HB .50-caliber machine gun, a MK19 MOD3 40mm grenade launcher, about twelve different kinds of winches, and if you got the deluxe model, heated windshields. (All this is according to “The Hummer Network,” an online community for all-things Hummercentric.) In its infancy, the Humvee mowed down rebels in Panama, whacked A-rabs in Desert Storm, and got its own G.I. Joe scale model.,Though these first models were obviously too baller for the streets, they were not too baller for the half-man, half-machine, all-Austrian, muscled up dreamboat Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Hummer was a true sidekick to the one-man-war turned mainstay of the action/war film genre turned GOP warrior.,Schwarzenegger, whose career was rapidly climbing—and would later peak with the seminal trilogy of _Kindergarten Cop_, _Junior_, and _Jingle All the Way_—needed a car that would match his ambitions. Unhappy with the “girlyman” heaps of tin he saw surrounding him, his life and the course of history was changed while on the set of _Kindergarten Cop_, when he saw a convoy of Army Humvees parading along. It was love at first sight.,Schwarzenegger, admiring the Hummer, was quoted as ex- claiming, “Look at those calves! Look at those deltoids!”,However, like all star-crossed lovers, things wouldn’t be easy for Arnold and the Humvee. The makers of the metal monstros- ity on wheels, AM General, would not allow the love to bloom, claiming that their vehicle was not “street-legal,” and that it was already going steady with the military.,Arnold was patient and persistent and by 1992, he got his way with the Humvee. The first Hummer H1, a modified version of the military vehicle was finally produced, with Arnold behind the wheel. (There is a pretty hilarious YouTube video of the unveiling ceremony, if you care to see it.),Over the years, the relationship between the Hummer and Ar- nold blossomed—he purchased an entire fleet of the vehicles for himself. The couple was inseparable and has often been called the Bogie and Bacall, the Brangelina, the peanut butter and jelly of the 90s.,Soon, everyone from Coolio to your mother had to get their hands on the Hummer, which became the new hot shit around town. Needless to say, this hurt its relationship with Arnold, who was heartbroken when the brand was sold to GM in 1998. Arnold, now focusing on a political career, was unable to be seen in public with his Hummers due to his newfound stance on girlyman issues such as the “environment” and “greenhouse gas emissions.”,Things only went downhill for the civilian Hummer. With gas prices rising and wallets getting thinner, even Coolio hawked off his Hummer, along with the crazy hybrid snake dreadlocks on his head. Sales in Hummers dipped and the new H2 and H3 models looked ugly as fuck, especially since the only color they seemed to come in was a disgusting combination of puke and a “goldenrod” Crayola crayon.,With the economic shitshow that has been GM’s past couple of years, Hummer was one of the first brands on the chopping block. Things seemed to be leveling out when it was announced that the brand would be sold to Sichuan Tengzheng, a Chinese automaker. But the deal fell through, and on February 26, GM announced that they would be cutting off the Hummer’s life support, allowing it to pass on to the Great Junkyard in the Sky, gracefully.,An open casket service will be held on Friday, March 5, for all models except the H3, whose physical deformities couldn’t even be fixed by a crack team of morticians and mechanics. The Hummer’s bodies will be buried beside their close friends, the DeLorean, all of Pontiac, and the Batmobile.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/rip-hummer/,"

"My name is Rebecca Gold; I’m a junior, and a proud native of Chicago, Illinois. It’s a new season of the Nass and this time we’re doin’ it up big style like we was in the Casimir Pulaski Day parade. I’ve been entrusted with the responsibility of doing the Weekend Page every other week. They tell me that I’ll be switching off weeks with a certain “Zeb Blackwell”, although not having met him, from his name I’m guessing that this is not a real boy at all but rather some sort of 1780 Pilgrim Robot. Only time will tell…..  In any case, you’re reading this on a Friday, which means you’ve just emerged from that weekday zombie haze and come upon the glistening shores of experience and cultural consumption that is the Weekend…my hopes are that this page will aid in that weekly revolution of the spirit, and give you a heads up to some important things going on around campus.

"Oscar Hyde having provided you, in his nefariously multifarious style, with all the juicy historical context you could possibly desire [see prior article], I find myself relieved of the standard duty to explain that “Newsom has two parents” and “Newsom plays the harp,” and in rather the unique and enviable position of being able to assume the reader already knows the basic Joanna Newsom story. Let me waste no time before beginning to sermonize, then, as to how we ought to think of Newsom’s intrepid new album. My first commandment is this: it is wrong, and hideous, and ungodly, to judge _Have One on Me_ quantitatively.,I’m sorry to begin what will otherwise be a truly joyous article on this somewhat sour note, and yet I feel it must be said: how is it that such an emotionally sensitive work of art is subjected to the patent absurdity of being graded? Am I the only one who sees something blasphemous in _Entertainment Weekly_’s taking Joanna Newsom’s most heartfelt gift to the world, years in the making, and assigning it an “A-minus”? As if to say, “Thanks anyway, Joanna, but your music isn’t quite good enough for us—we’ll stick with Lady Gaga.” And more importantly, how is it possible that a man who evaluates music for a living can listen to the entire album and then haughtily stamp the quality of his experience with the value of “4” out of 10? Are you deaf, _Popmatter_’s Matthew Fiander? Are you insane?,In truth, Fiander could mount a decent defense of his erring review if only he admitted what is self-evident, namely, that he didn’t have time to listen to the album—a music critic can’t listen to _everything_ he reviews—and so he resorted to educated guesses as to what the album’s flaws might be. I mean, it’s reasonable to think that an album over two hours long would turn out to be meandering, its holistic integrity lacking, its narration exhausting. And truly, if _Have One on Me_ were two hours’ worth of _Ys_, it would be a difficult sell. But as the better critics have noted, and as Newsom herself explains, the new album is unlike _Ys_ in that it is more direct, relying less on folksy parable and more on relatively straightforward sentiments about the vagaries of love, the primacy of the home, the power of kindness. It’s not that she was being dishonest on previous albums, of course; as Newsom put it in a recent interview with [the UK’s] _The Times_, “It’s just a straighter path to the same truth.”,Joanna Newsom’s truth has always been an excruciatingly beautiful thing. That’s why we listened to 2004’s _Milk-Eyed Mender_, back when her voice was a bit screechy and even “childish” (although I hesitate to use the word, knowing that she resents it as a description of her voice, and knowing that she is at this very moment reading these words). That’s also why we listened to Ys, despite early doubts as to whether any album ought to be allowed to have such shockingly long tracks. But when the last harp- and heart-string was plucked on opening track “Emily,” the question suddenly became: why would Newsom ever write a song less than twelve minutes long again?,As an artist, Newsom is suited to such epic song lengths, and to elaborate conceptual projects more broadly, simply because she has the rare talent, she is the rare talent, capable of pulling them off. And with regard to _Have One on Me_, the consensus is already crystallized—there can be no doubt about it—Newsom, by God, has done it again. Over the course of three discs’ worth of immaculate songwriting, she has shown that despite her insomnia and her professed worldly haplessness, she is putting her time to better use than everyone else. She is the artist _par excellence_, the stubborn perfectionist with all the right instincts, a voice that dances easily as nimbly as Regina Spektor’s, a constantly evolving aesthetic, and _ambitions_, giant, tremendous ambitions that always seem indubitably fated to come across as pretentious _but never do_.,For the fact of the matter is that Newsom is not pretentious, but rather, is simply an extraordinarily thoughtful, heartbreakingly honest young woman. We _know_ that she is authentic, we _believe_ in every word, every precious syllable, she utters. But how is it, exactly, that so many of us come away from her music so profoundly convinced? Whence comes this felt certainty that her passion is genuine and pure, that she isn’t just a modern Meat Loaf, but really the actual embodiment of boundless human sympathy, the elusive and ephemeral forest spirit who, as Oscar put it, _feels_ life, and feels it both deeply and rightly?,How do we know? Anecdotally, there’s the quote that Oscar cited with regard to the vocal cord nodes, when Newsom “was constantly telling [herself], don’t feel, don’t feel, don’t feel,” to prevent herself crying and thereby damaging her voice. There’s also the intriguing mystery of her romance with Bill Callahan, AKA Smog, creator of such stoic sonic treasures as “Rock Bottom Riser” and of music in general that evinces the same heartfelt sincerity we are wont to ascribe to Newsom. But our instinctive belief in her passion is not derived from sundry anecdotes. No—we simply hear it in her voice.,In _Have One on Me_, we hear it at almost every moment of the two hours, and it is perfect, liberated, majestic, riveting. As Oscar related, Newsom’s singing has come a long way since _Milk-Eyed Mender_, and she wastes no time in demonstrating as much: from the first second of opening track “Easy,” her voice begins the quavering, fluty dance it maintains throughout the album. Newsom uses the 18 tracks to explore the full range of her emotions, and a truly staggering range it is; from its early coziness, through its various intoxicating crescendos and its stiller moments of sadness, nostalgia, serenity, or lullaby, the album shifts like some exquisite weather pattern, with Newsom as the pale, benevolent goddess who both conjures the storm and conducts us safely through it, leading us gently by the hand.,Indeed, it is the incredibly intimate nature of the album that makes it so completely inappropriate to place it anywhere on some damnable numeric scale. More than ever before, it seems that Newsom is speaking directly to the listener: she whispers “darling” in our ears and it seems no other lips could ever deserve to pronounce the word; she sings of her belief in everyone (an alternative candidate, when you hear how she sings it, for defining lyric of the album: “I believe in everyone/I believe, regardless/I believe in everyone,” from “’81”) and we realize how very far above critics and criticism she is, as a spiritual being who sincerely considers closeness to the earth, to nature, one of her very highest priorities. And of course, she sings endlessly of love: from “Who died, and made you in charge/of who loves who?” (in “Easy”) to “The phantom of love/moves among us at will” (in “Esme”), Newsom contemplates from every angle the lack of say we have over who we are and what we feel. In fine, with brave, poignant soul-confessions on every page of the lyric sheet, we can’t help but think of Newsom more as a human being worthy of actual love than an artist worthy only of admiration—and we do not assign letter grades to the people we love, _Entertainment Weekly_. Especially A-minuses, which are just _designed_ to be insulting.,Let us now tour, very quickly, very briefly, through _Have One on Me_ itself. Having listened to virtually nothing else since its release on the 23rd, I feel able to guide the curious listener to certain moments that reward extra attention.,The album opens with what is perhaps its most irresistible track, the already mentioned “Easy.” Every fan of Ys, I think, felt an ecstatic thrill at that first flute trill—it comes at 3:13, you know it when you hear it—reminiscent as it is of Van Dyke Parks’ incredible orchestration. But “Easy” proves, of course, that it isn’t Parks who ensures that Newsom’s compositions are beautifully arranged.,The third track, “’81,” is one of the prettiest songs Newsom has ever recorded. It’s just the angel with her harp; Newsom well knows when additional instrumentation would only weigh a song down. “Good Intentions Paving Company,” an upbeat barroom piano number and the first single from the album, has been very warmly received. What most critics fail to mention is that the outro, with the subtle introduction of that sweet, sweet trombone, makes the song.,“In California” is the best arrangement on the album, and very possibly the best song; certainly it is the centerpiece, considering that it appears halfway through the second disc, and the final track of the album is its refrain. At 5:30, when the song really picks up and Newsom speaks breathlessly of being unable to fall asleep, of fully abandoning any thought of anywhere but home—“Sometimes I can almost feel the power”—one feels, as much because of the lyrics as of the judicious use of timpani thunder rolls, that one is on the verge, on the verge—and then, at about 6:45—that sudden swell!—I swear to you, friend, the album is worth buying if only for that moment. I don’t want to describe it further lest I diminish the glory of that first listen.,“Jackrabbits” is perhaps the track most likely to win a tear from the staunchly masculine eye. “Go Long,” another track warmly received by critics, features Newsom playing three harps (having layered them in the studio—she only has two hands) and producing a sumptuous sound describable only as “glittering rain.” In “Soft as Chalk,” a bluesy piano ballad, there is hot danger in her voice when she shouts, “There is only lawlessness!” And during the jazzy breakdown at the very end, her trembling voice trails away over the choppily descending piano chords like a candle flame fighting desperately for its last moments of life.,In tracks like “Autumn,” and throughout the album, the subtly humming instrumentation comes across exactly like an extension of Newsom’s own voice. It is not intrusive, it does not steal the spotlight, it does not distract in the slightest from her exquisitely expressed emotions. As a whole, the instrumentation on the album is nothing more or less than the sonic complementation her poetry requires to be properly understood. Albums like this remind us that art can have a purpose higher than mere entertainment or self-expression: Newsom_ communicates_ with the listener with an indescribable immediacy, a warm, convincing intimacy that just can’t be found anywhere else in music right now, darling.,And so it is a very sad moment when, at the end of the album, Newsom begins packing up to leave. In the last track, “Does Not Suffice,” she sings literally of packing up her dresses, coats, and shoes, her buttons, silks, and jewelry—for “It does not suffice, / to merely lie beside each other, / as those who love each other do.” Love passes, albums end, so it goes, _c’est la vie_.,As a truly dense album, the beauty of _Have One on Me_ can only be unraveled gradually, and Newsom, who is never going to stop being told that she is one of the greatest songwriters of her—our—generation, will be riding the slow wave of its fuller and fuller appreciation for a long time to come. It is too early to say whether, after a closer tarrying with the lyrics, obvious thematic distinctions will come into focus between the three discs. It may be that no such sharpness develops, leaving the album more a two-hour caress of the eardrums than a story with eighteen separate chapters. But if it takes me a decade or two to decide these questions, all the better, for it was clear to me from the first listen that Newsom’s latest and greatest gift deserves a permanent, eminent place in the soundtrack of our lives.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/you-may-stay-here-me/,"

"An older gentleman strolls out of a restaurant on the upper eastside and sees a bum slumped against the building’s wall. The bum asks for something to eat, and the man rummages in his doggy bag and hands him a baked potato. Appalled, the bum spits and returns the potato. “You got anything else?” he asks, to which our patrician gent scoffs and declares with a haughty, supercilious air, “’Beggars can’t be choosers’ – Shakespeare”. “Yeah?” says the bum. “Fuck you, fuck your mother and fuck your dog – Mamet.”,It is 1983. The up-and-coming American playwright, David Mamet, has hit the proverbial wall. He is months deep in the script for his new play, a drama about a Chicago real-estate agency, with no end in sight. In an act of desperation, he appends a plea for guidance to the script and sends it to Harold Pinter. “What do I do?” asks Mamet. “Help me, what does it need?” Pinter famously replies, “Production”, and forwards it to his friend at the Royal National Theater. , appears in London the following September, and is awarded the Pulitzer shortly thereafter. Mamet becomes one of America’s most acclaimed and respected living playwrights. 	,It is 2007. The aging American playwright, David Mamet, is the co-producer and writer of CBS’ ,, a show that chronicles the exploits of an all-male, top-secret military unit and the picayune intrigues of their women. The lure of film has apparently supplanted his desire to make theater. For fifteen years he has splashed about in the waters of Hollywood, proffering to the public a gloomy procession of routinely underwhelming movies. He writes books on cinema. He scribbles political cartoons and displays them on the ,. As a playwright, he barely exists. ,It is 2008, and David Mamet has authored a new play. ,It is 2008, and it is a new low for David Mamet. ,Titled ,, Mamet’s new play follows the last week in the presidency of Charles Smith, whose single term in office is remarkable only for the magnitude of its failings. Its self-consciously “zany” plot revolves (loosely) around Smith’s scheme to exploit the annual Thanksgiving Day pardon – wherein the president excuses a Turkey from slaughter – as an opportunity to launch his reelection campaign. ,Smith is played by Nathan Lane; this fact alone should set off a veritable army of red flags in the heads of long-time Mamet fans. How one could ever hope to reconcile the Mamet of ,and ,– ordained heir to the tradition of Beckett and Pinter – with Nathan Lane, rubber-faced and beloved, a man with the body of Jackie Gleason and the voice of Ethel Mermen – much less find cause to utter the two names in the same breath – is a hopeless question, and moreover the wrong question. ,For the question, rather, is this: How does one reconcile the Mamet of , with Nathan Lane? The answer, obviously, is ,. But who is this new Mamet of ,, and what is his response to his old haunt, American theater? ,Well, for one thing, today’s David Mamet appears an astute observer of newspaper headlines. Throughout the play, he parades before us the familiar host of Issues that delimits Red and Blue in today’s America: Voter Fraud, Gay Marriage, Terrorism, Avian Flu, and so forth. However, in his treatment of these issues, Mamet consistently neuters them of their tragedy and their horror, rendering them wacky conundrums that merely drive the plot. When, despite the author’s best ability, the seriousness of these issues creeps back into the play and causes it to veer toward an interesting moral dilemma for the characters, Mamet commandeers the wheel and flees, tail between his legs, back to the soft comfort that the Broadway Comedy affords him. ,In his search for humorous material, Mamet has mined from the coagulum of our popular culture a grubby array of all-too-familiar jokes and conceits: the usual suspects, life-blood of pundits, TV satirists and bloggers, so obvious that no one person would dare assume credit for their devising because any of us could have, and all of us did, devise them. Smith: “Why can’t we build a fence to keep out illegal immigrants?” Chief of Staff: “Because we need the illegal immigrants to build the fence!” And so on. ,Now add to this a number of horrible one-liners. These are sad, painful one-liners, and Lane delivers them with an antic bravado that makes their tinny resonance all the more grating to the ear. ,Finally, today’s Mamet is apparently unwilling to fashion a single character that is not also a caricature. Satire – even political satire – does not excuse a playwright from his duty to create human beings, however fictional. Characters need not be three-dimensional, deeply psychological beings, and not every one of them need be original. But Mamet’s characters are all threadbare, wire-and-tape assemblages of popular stereotypes – and nothing more. We have a corrupt idiot-in-chief, keen to torture and generous with racial slurs, eager and willing to abuse the Constitution for his own interests. We have a Jewish liberal lesbian speechwriter, who has just adopted a baby from China. We have a smarmy, bespectacled corporate stooge. We are even graced with the atrocity of Dwight Grackle, an “Injun” casino-owner with feathers in his hair and poison darts in his primitive Injun blowpipe. These characters are nothing more than the sum of their vague and hollow descriptors. ,In its favor, the play does afford the audience a pittance of catharsis. “Why don’t they want me in office?” the hapless president asks his top aid. “Because they hate you!” he shouts back. “Because they hate you!” The crowd roared at moments like this because, frankly, we do: at least, the last time I checked, 83% of America does not approve of George W. Bush and doubtless no small portion of those people bear genuine hate for the man. And even though our proxy is Nathan Lane, it is nice to see someone hack through the self-delusional, drool-on-lip demeanor of a commander-in-chief and convey the message of disapproval loud and clear. ,But the obvious inspiration of Lane’s character, coupled with the issues Mamet returns to again and again (Gay Marriage, Avian Flu etc.), begs the simple question: Why now? Why not four years ago, before the 2004 election, when this material had more clout? Today, George W. Bush is the very easiest of targets. The furor over the ongoing presidential election, along with the nation-wide clarion-call for Change, has rendered him a prematurely lame-duck president. Of course we all hate him. Today our country is not seized by the fierce division of four years ago. Today is not four years ago. ,Today, there is simply no reason for this play to exist.,As I type these words, my heart emits a frightful yelp, a strain beyond the familiar clamor of its cigarette-induced arrhythmia. This is because I want only the very best for David Mamet. From a very early age, my father instilled in me an abiding love for the man’s work.,Dear David Mamet, this review is a hatchet job, and I’m the first to admit it. But it’s one that hurts me as much as it hurts you.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/dammit_mamet/,"

"Marked by a certain charged starkness and by an utterly terrifying absurdity, Greenwood’s score to , is ushered in with trademark twangs and plucks which register as the pulse of the film itself. In “Open Spaces” an ominous nearly-lush melodic darkness is interrupted by a hopeful, yet doomed juxtaposition which eventually melts into the pathos of the heralding rush.  The call and response of tragedy and exuberance is a theme of the film as well as the score, and as the response-side of “Open Spaces” frays into echoes and warbles and tremors, it manifests a prefiguring of the operation of the entire film: humor does not simply accent a descent into terror, humor is itself the terror into which we descend lead by the acrobatic madness of Daniel Day Lewis’ Daniel Plainview.,Where else do we see this mania? It begins the movie in Greenwood’s “Future Markets” which commences like the background music to a madly anticipatory tip-toe, continually frustrated and then reborn anew with fresh ardor. The harried, distressed confusion is punctured with single notes whose contrast against the clamor only serves to accentuate the larger frenzy. In this piece, we are introduced to a trademark of Greenwood’s score—interruption and heightened re-start.,“Proven Lands” is a practice in this art. Arresting and bizarre, “Proven Lands” is nearly upbeat—until it becomes quite obvious that the track runs not on optimism (despite what the desperately interweaving piano would have you believe), but on thinly veiled aggression and ambition. Yet the violence is interiorized. The plucked instruments and the beating bows compete with one another. The song speeds itself up, trips on itself, and breaks through itself simultaneously with a bewildering impatience; the result is a chaotic, quasi-folk revival which bursts through and seethes in the gaps it itself creates. ,Greenwood’s score is not simply background music, it insinuates itself into the story being told. To travel the line of Greenwood’s music is to experience what Paul Thomas Andersen presents to the audience in Daniel Plainview. A psychological portrait is unfurled, not a plot. Here you do not laugh and cry with the protagonist—you laugh until you understand how laughter is itself The Cry. Each piece of Greenwood’s score is catastrophic, searching, harried, mad, sly, and witty—like Plainview himself. In so many of these songs, redemption is an unfulfilled promise: tracks end abruptly, unresolved, or just simply not quite how we expected. Like the title to the film, Greenwood’s score is suffused with a violent and hungry anticipation.,This is not the typical background fare. Greenwood does not hold your hand and lead you through a story. This is not the sort of score which uses melodrama to dictate emotions to the audience: now the criminal enters, cue suspenseful bleating, insert-feeling-here. The genius of this score is a result of its total dismissal of trite obligations: the score treats the film and the audience with respect. It is a work of art, not a didactic tool. Each track proves that a single fragment can contain a totality: it tells the story as much as the narrative tells the story. Profoundly organic, it is an outgrowth of the very soil of the Anderson’s film. To say it plainly: Jonny Greenwood’s score is correct.  Rarely has a score been so deeply considered.,It came as a surprise to many then to discover that Jonny Greenwood was disqualified from being considered for Best Score by the Academy. The reasoning offered was that “the majority of [the Blood score] was not composed specifically for the film.” Anyone who experiences the film will understand the lack of nuance this assertion betrays. I would be hard-pressed to find another movie whose score was crafted more specifically for the film. ,What we can infer from this slight is that the Academy, like so many other traditional and established artistic communities, has yet to accept the collage as a legitimate art-form. In a , interview, Burroughs discusses this bias in relation to his “cut-up” method, “People say to me, ‘Oh, this is all very good, but you got it by cutting up.’ I say that has nothing to do with it, how I got it. What is any writing but a cut-up? …Somebody has to , the cutting-up. Remember that I first made the selections. Out of hundreds of possible sentences that I might have used, I chose one.”,We are now at a point in human progress where we can look forward and backward to see a breathtaking landscape of human creative achievement. Perhaps this is a convenient juncture for us to re-consider what it means to be original, what it means to be daring, what it means to have genius, if that concept still holds any purchase.,The most rudimentary and simplistic way of thinking about a creator is as someone who teases something out of absolutely nothing. But even God breathed into ,. An obsession with this “something from nothing” framework drives our art into an untenable and stultifying esotericism. To cut up—to take the rib from Adam, and press it into the wet dirt, and to then use your own hot breath to forge naked life—this is the process of creation. Wealthy men do not beg for food—with a creative legacy that is so rich, starving artists should hunger only for bread, not for inspiration.,We use what we are given; we use the tools around us, to craft art and to communicate meaning. Preoccupying oneself with being the first and the different—in this day and age, such a posture is mere selfishness and ego. The ability to combine and create, to innovate and to invent, to bring together disparate sounds and moods and textures and, in doing so, to produce a work of art that is not only dazzling, but true is the very character of modern genius.,The collage is not a poor man’s art nor is it the second-best. When we examine the new generation of young artists, we notice a burgeoning culture of collage. It is not just in the remix and the mash-up, but also in the cultural fusion (a la Vampire Weekend). Like Burroughs said, ,. We negotiate a fragmented world. We communicate this world to an audience. Is it not then natural to use disjunctions and confusion and collision and piecemeal construction in our presentation of a confused, disjointed, colliding world?,“An artistic product must stand or fall on what’s there,” said Burroughs. Jonny Greenwood’s score does not only stand, it rises. The Academy’s slight should come as a wary reminder to a new generation of artists: there remain those who, given a choice between something and nothing, would have nothing. The genteel nihilism of the old school, which would choose “original” mediocrity over collaged brilliance, can be simply dismissed as absurd. Yet if Greenwood’s score tells us anything, it is just this sort of absurdity that when given power, veers quickly into the disturbing.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/original_sins/,"

"A sigh of relief in Washington as former Republican congressman and present director of the Office of Management and Budget Jim Nussle declares that there is little reason to worry in the short-run about our deficit, which is expected to grow to 400 billion dollars by the time President Bush leaves office. , cites Mr. Nussle’s characterization of the deficit as “manageable”: “It isn’t the largest in history by any stretch of the imagination.”  ,Mr. Nussle went further, saying that the deficit “in sheer dollar terms doesn’t mean anything” when compared to the size of the economy. The Democrats responded with the insight and subtlety which has become their trademark, arguing that “if the deficit can be dismissed so easily, so can the problem of domestic spending.” ,When asked how Mr. Bush plans to maneuver a Democrat-controlled Congress to have his way, a Republican member who prefers to remain anonymous responded, “Uh, most likely by asking them to bend over and then politely requesting that they be his bitch.” The Congressman added that there was a reason why the Democratic symbol is an ass. “A smooth, supple ass,” he added unnecessarily. A Democratic colleague responded to these insinuations with silence and measured capitulation. ,But with the election looming, bi-partisan posturing is looking more promising than ever. There is hope—however slight—that both parties may take this opportunity to work in tandem to drive this country into a financial debt that is at once crushing and inescapable.  ,Yet there are those who resist such a happy ending. Many have once again raised the deeply confusing issues of Medicare and Medicaid. Mr. Bush suggested that the problem be solved by reducing payments given to hospitals and doctors. In typical, irritating fashion, the Democrats objected. Some Democrats would prefer to use a “pay as you go” method, which would mean that America would borrow money to pay for infrastructure as opposed to charging them to a budget. This sound plan would finally make use of a long untapped American resource, the mystical money-lending unicorn that daily shoots coins and happiness out of her pearlescent horn. ,Still others hope to “set up a bipartisan commission to help the next president and Congress deal with these issues, possibly through legislation.” This plan has come under scrutiny after many remembered that legislation has not solved a problem since 1954. ,Mr. Bush’s final budget is 3 trillion dollars. While he vows to cut spending in every area except Child Health, he has shown his ability to compromise with the Democrats by agreeing to never cut taxes and repeatedly whispering, “Nanny-nanny-boo-boo, you can’t catch me.” Democrats in Congress are beginning to unbuckle their belts and drop their pants in preparation for the “battle” ahead of them.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/week_in_review3/,"

"Rumor has it that at the Nass, there is a gap in the otherwise omniscient knowledge of the staff, and that that gap is called “sports.” Not so, ladies and gentlemen. Let me tell you a thing or two about layin’ up the three-pointer ball and slammin’ in the dunkin’.,My first point is directed to the fresh-faced among you who were recently swept up in the national phenomenon sensationally titled “March Madness,” a truly primitive sporting event long adored by a certain cultish subset of the population, but of no interest whatsoever to reflective persons. As reflective persons are aware, reflective persons prefer to watch _real_ basketball—which brings me to my next point.,The present time, my friends, is one of those magical, glorious times when something incredibly great is about to happen; the likes of which will never, ever happen again. Thus this article, which is devoted to the sole end of hyping up this seemingly unoverhypeable, fantastically amazing, absolutely extraordinary, and at this point, to be perfectly honest, perhaps already overhyped event: this year’s NBA Finals, featuring the Cleveland Cavaliers and the laky (or “lake-like”) Los Angeles Lakers.,Now, those of you who both follow basketball and are insolent by nature are probably thinking to yourselves, “Bro, wait a second—the playoffs haven’t even started yet, yo—what makes you so sure it’ll be L.A. and Cleveland? What about Denver, yo, or Boston? Isn’t this the Magic’s year? What about D. Wade, yo? Yo yo yo? Yo-yo?” And I sympathize, insolent fanboy. Hailing from central Florida, I, too, like to imagine that this will finally be the Magic’s year. But then I remember two terrible, formidable names: Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, easily the NBA’s biggest stars.,Around this time last year, Cleveland and L.A. were at more or less the same place in the NBA standings as they are now: on top. Once the playoffs started, as they began rolling through the early rounds, commercials started popping up featuring LeBron and Kobe as puppets, chatting competitively—this in addition, of course, to the zillions of ads featuring them separately, to the zillions of debates over who should win MVP, etc. The LeBron and Kobe puppets weren’t as recognizable as they should’ve been, but the implicit message was obvious and everyone was already thinking it: these guys are going to meet in the Finals and it’s going to be awesome.,But then there was a freak accident: picnic, lightning, _Dwight Howard_. And LeBron couldn’t carry his whole team and the Magic eliminated the Cavs and the Kobe/LeBron commercials stopped being aired and David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA who looks more Jewish every time you see him, wept in complete silence for 40 days, after which he was said to have cried out, “Hear me, fanboys around the nation: _strings shall be pulled!_” In the end, the 2009 season was like some grotesque production of the Trojan War in which Hector never actually ends up fighting Brad Pitt, and the incomparably beautiful Diane Kruger is nowhere to be seen.,In other words, last year was a tragic, disgusting fluke, and with the exception of a handful of desperately loyal yo-yo slinging Magic fans, nobody is going to let the same thing happen again. LeBron’s team is significantly improved, Kobe is still impossible to guard, and it is clearly as inevitable that they will meet in the Finals in 2010 as it is inevitable that Sarah Palin will be elected president in 2012. (Incidentally, the former is distinguishable from the latter by the fact that it is exciting in a _good_ way.) In perfect truth, it is no exaggeration to say that this year’s Finals will be a clash of heroes more epic than that yawn of a “poem” about Achilles. It will be the historic culmination of a rivalry itself rivaled in intensity and interestingness only by the intensely interesting Nadal-Federer rivalry.,If he were still with us, David Foster Wallace would probably argue that the Nadal-Federer rivalry (or, as Federer would have it, the Federer-Nadal rivalry) is in fact the more interesting of the two. But although DFW was a great writer, a great appreciator of sports, and a great, great man, he had, alas, a _flaw_: his thinking about sports was warped by his bias in favor of tennis.,Verily, there is something surpassingly elegant about the two Nike-clothed bodies on opposite sides of the net responding so perfectly to one another they seem somehow to be connected, every tiniest movement necessarily precise, both men lost in a deep and almost meditative concentration. But this extraordinary harmony of movement can only come at the expense of the layers of complexity found in sports with more than two people involved—and something very interesting indeed is added when coordination and cooperation become vital components of the game. DFW reveals his bias, his blindness to the beauty of _the team_, in the central thesis of his 1994 essay, “How Tracy Austin Broke my Heart” (which is nevertheless a classic little work of sports appreciation):,“Those who receive and act out the gift of athletic genius must, perforce, be blind and dumb about it – and not because blindness and dumbness are the price of the gift, but because they are its essence.”,The context of the quote reveals that DFW’s primary meaning is that great athletes are capable of a transcendent, utterly incomprehensible _focus_, and that this is what makes them great. They are able to “shut off the Iago-like voice of the self” in a way that “ungreat” athletes simply cannot. DFW’s argument applies wonderfully to a sport like tennis, where the competition itself involves nothing but pure bodily focus; or, better, to most events in the Olympics, when the key is simply to silence self-awareness and _perform_. But it isn’t universally applicable, to say the least; certainly, it doesn’t do justice to the much more complex form of athletic genius we are all going to witness in April.,Because basketball, my friends, is a very different ball of wax—especially when the teams involved are led by players universally acknowledged to be _superstars_. Everyone, even _painfully_ unreflective persons, understands that the team strategy revolves around the superstar. And we know from his interviews, which (thank God) are not at all heartbreaking in DFW’s sense, that Kobe understands the subtleties of his role, perhaps better than anyone else: to win games, he must be a general, an organizer, a motivator, and of course, an incredible athlete, at every moment. His mind is the official on-court locus of the constantly-revised team strategy, his expression the absolute flag of the team’s emotional state; the other players literally look to Kobe to see whether they should be angry, serene, or laughing. And Kobe flickers from one of these emotions to another in an instant—always conscious, always present, always _performing_—all for the sake of the win.,Now, Kobe is undoubtedly capable of the level of focus that DFW presents as the gold standard of greatness—LeBron, less so—and that, incidentally, is the reason that the Lakers will win the series. When Kobe faces LeBron in this year’s Finals, shit’s gonna get superb.,In the end, my friends, you need only understand that the world of basketball is coming to a head… the perfect store is brewing… the stars of the NBA are liter- ally—well, not literally, still figuratively, but _differently_no figuratively— aligning. How much persuasion do you require? I fear if I use one image too few, you won’t tune in to the greatest sporting event of all time. That in itself is no tragedy, of course—it would simply be “your loss,” as they say. No, my fear is much more dire: namely, that if I’ve chosen the wrong metaphors, _no one at all_ will tune in come April, I’ll be the only one watching, ratings will plummet to zero, and the NBA will be forced to file for bankruptcy, calling off the Finals just as they’ve begun. This may strike you as an unfounded worry, but I assure you: most of my worries are unfounded. In this case, I imagine myself carrying the great burden that one would be carrying if the American masses really made their entertainment decisions based on articles in the _Nass_.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/shall-be-greatest-nba-finals-all-time/,"

"Barack Obama–U.S. Senator and Democratic candidate for president–has, if nothing else, my entire extended, voting-age family in a polarized tizzy.  My mother isn’t voting for Obama because of his smoker’s teeth–my uncle because his middle name is Hussein.  My father likes his health care platform–his father-in-law is filled with warmth by his back story and earnestness.  Me?  I’m voting for Obama because he won a Grammy.  ,U haz a flavr, Sen. Obama, and there hasn’t been a pop star who hasn’t leaned in somehow in recent weeks for a taste.  Arcade Fire’s Win Butler called Obama “the first candidate in my lifetime to strip some of this bullshit away” in a Scrapbook entry on the band’s website.  The Fiery Furnaces have made sure to voice their support for the senator-from-Illinois, not the senator from Illinois, and have even organized a caucus on their blog in the spirit of Obamenthusiasm to determine the title and sound of their next record: “Please go stand over in the corner of the Internet next to the album of your choice.”  And the list continues!  Conor Oberst, Will Smith, OK Go, The Cool Kids, The Grateful Dead, Third Eye Blind, at least one Dixie Chick, Jackson Browne, Morrissey, Barry Manilow, Jeff Tweedy, Bette Midler, Herbie Hancock, Branford Marsalis, M. Ward, Barbra Streisand, T-Pain (we think), Little Richard (maybe), Boy George (probably), Twiggy (less likely), and, posthumously, Karlheinz Stockhausen (no.).,Mr. Obama trades in a vernacular that transcends trendy Hollywood liberalism in accessing something strange and deeply dangerous about the fine line between politician and pop star.  The Obamaesthetic is something palpable and undeniable–something that might, in lesser words, be packaged into JFK comparisons and references to “hope.”  But it’s not all his doing.  What of this moment–the seething, gnashing place and time of Right Now–makes Sen. Obama feel like the star-child from the cookie jar that he does?  Why does Mr. Obama feel like the right candidate for right now for the wrong reasons?,In a sense, 2008 began on January 15.  In his keynote address at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo this morning, Steve Jobs is concluding his unveiling of the Macbook Air with some light entertainment from Randy Newman, who presumably is supposed to provide some prescheduled repose to allow the journalists and bloggers in the packed audience to collect their thoughts and organize their notes from Jobs’ presentation.  Newman’s is a harmless position occupied at previous Macworlds by such Steve-picked luminaries as Smashmouth, John Mayer, The Wallflowers, and KT Turnstall.  Randy Newman–one of rock music’s greatest hucksters, a bucking, lurching Fats Domino marionette and part-time genius who could sell commercial jingles for slave traders (‘Sail Away’) and exhortations to bigotry (‘Short People’) like cool slices of pound cake with vanilla ice cream–might have been a predictable, safe choice any other year.  ,The lights turn on Newman.  “It’s a great honor, uh, to be here.  I’ll talk while I’m still moving,” he says, and he has the bloggers in his palm.  He is here “to explicate what America is,” he says, “just sum it up in about two minutes, twenty-seven seconds.”  His actual explication–a darling, sing-spoken recounting of European history’s baddest baddies as Pixar might have rendered them–doesn’t really count.  It’s the American that slips through the margins of Newman’s song and language that we are paying attention to: ,“You know it pisses me off a little,that this Supreme Court is gonna outlive me,Couple of young Italian fellas and a brother on the Court now, too,But I defy you to find me, anywhere in the world,,Two Italians as tight-asses as the two Italians we got.,And as for the brother,,Well, Pluto’s not a planet anymore either.”,As the song ends, Newman squirms, hovering above his keys like he is going to continue playing, but suddenly leans back into his character and addresses the audience again:,“You know, in many ways, that was about the toughest act to follow of any act, you know, I once came on, the, uh, with David Frosh or something after the Flying Wallendas, that was difficult.  But this was hard.  You know, it’s not John D. Rockefeller or Andrew Carnegie, I mean, you can tell when someone’s a human being, like when they’re brought up well or something, you know, I watch CNBC when I’m orchestrating and stuff ‘cause there’s no music and stuff, and I love the numbers, you know, I always have my, my uncles were compulsive gamblers and used to take me to the track, and it’s the same shit, really, you know, and, uh, I like it, I like watching Jim Cramer and all that stuff, and, uh, he, uh, and they’ll go through like this whole foreclosure thing with the insurance thing, and it took ‘em weeks to bench the people who were actually gettin’ foreclosed on, it was this company goin’ down and that company goin’ down, but this is like, I don’t know.  I mean, it’s human stuff; I couldn’t understand most of what he said, but if, but I understood more of this stuff than I ever understood from anybody else, you know, I’ve mastered the answering machine, which is more than my parents ever did.”,Wearing the wild-haired, unbuttoned look of a prophet, Newman takes the bloggers and geeks out of the auditorium, out of Apple’s world of glass and brushed steel and into a stowaway’s America, a squinting look from between the cracks of the floorboards at a country twiddling its thumbs waiting for something new by convincing itself of its own imminent demise.  The audience thinks they’re laughing as he talks, but Newman is laughing harder, underneath and within his words.  “They cut Buzz and Woody’s big love scene, so this is what we ended up with,” Newman says as he introduces his performance of ,Randy Newman as a harbinger of doom?  We want to call what’s he presented a protest song, but labeling it “protest” only deadens it, gives it a nice shirt and slacks.  What does a protest song in 2008 even mean?  The butt-end of the business cycle is leaving behind a national smog in which health care, mortgages, and unemployment are suddenly and once again charged with effortless danger and a thick, spongy helplessness.  But where is the real malaise?  The TV writers are on strike, Heath Ledger is dead, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is the best governor California has had in decades.  Music is free, and Brad Renfro is dead.  There’s no rebate stimulus plan for what we’re really burdened by right now: that pent-up sense of secret disaster, accumulated over seven years but chopped up by a short national attention span into something newly absurd and all the weirder.  ,2008’s American Democracy is less about an election, a primary, or a candidate than it is about the ways in which these parts can be replaced, made irrelevant, in the machinery of the American dialogue.  In the throes of primary season, there is something hugely fatalistic about the procession of the candidates from their early clutter of unlikelies to the four that remained after Florida to whoever is left after Super Tuesday’s dust clears, as if each field-narrowing move were orchestrated by something grander and more operatic than the initiated voters of a few states.  This is epic theatre played out in RSS feeds, a political process boiled apart, hung to dry, and sold in spicy, extra-condensed strips to a hungry nation.  There has never been an election more critical, more sea-changing than this first post-W one, and yet that makes it also the most obvious, the most procedural and posturing and transparent than any in history.  2008 is, after all, the year in which Britney Spears’ flag-covered coffin will be carried down the Ninth Ward of New Orleans like a president’s, the year in which Bloodshy and Avant will produce Chris Brown’s electro-spiked cover of “Blowin’ in the Wind,” the one in which Hannah Montana’s bouncy rendition of “A Change Is Gonna Come” will top the iTunes charts for six consecutive weeks in August and September 2008.  The change was always gonna come this year, so why does everyone feel the need to sing and play about it?,Hillary chooses Céline Dion’s “You and I” as her official campaign song?  Fine, but what of Ron Paul schlepping a bleary-eyed Adam Ant on the campaign trail, Ralph Nader scoring a campaign commercial with Laurie Anderson’s “O Superman,” or Mike Bloomberg announcing his campaign flanked by Michael Bolton and former members of the Electric Light Orchestra?  A bloated Mike Huckabee rocks “Sweet Home Alabama” on the bass guitar with Chuck Norris clapping along?  All good, but what about Mitt Romney taking on the Ondes Martenot at a campaign stop in Minnesota or Mike Gravel demonstrating his harpsichord prowess, at the urging of an eager supporter in upstate New York, with a spirited performance of Scarlatti’s “Sonata for Harpsichord in A major”?,Mr. Obama is the only candidate who seems to make sense playing a role in all of this, the only one who appears to have risen from the earth like a smoking, grinning Gingerbread Man ,ready for this particular moment in history.  We’re going to find campaign commercials for Sen. Obama in the unlikeliest of places this year: in the ways we start viewing the world around us, in the ways in which we find ourselves talking to other people, in the ways in which we find ourselves reacting to events.  In case the Obama campaign still needs an extra commercial, though, I have one for them: a thirty-second long take of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, ablaze in fire, skittering and clattering into the darkness of a desert highway, set to that adorable cooing song from the Macbook Air commercial.

"A heroic moment in American oratory two Sundays ago, when our President rose before Congress, wiped away his crusties and spoke for longer than five minutes without utterly destroying another facet of American life.  Bush emphasized his legacy as one that is pro-dream and anti-totalitarianism, urging us to consider the warning of “the late terrorist Zarqawi”: “We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.” Approximately 45% of those gathered felt a cold chill, 20% shivered, and 10% clucked their tongues in dismay. The remaining 25% shrugged it off. ,Unfazed by the errant quarter, Bush continued. “The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.”  ,“What every terrorist fears most,” Bush archly asserted, “is human freedom.” As has been noted in personal accounts, the President’s easy-going manner makes him the quick confidante of many. It is no surprise then that even terrorists felt comfortable discussing their fears with the silver-haired Texan, as well as their dreams, hopes, and insatiable drive to cause pain.  ,Sources believe these terrorists may have hinted to Bush in AIM chat sessions that they were building a weapon that would not only do away with our physical bodies, but also obliterate the notions of “hope” itself. Some of these sources have gone further by suggesting that knowledge of the existence of such a weapon might be used strategically by the Republican Party as part of an “October surprise” designed to undermine the likely Democratic candidate Barack Obama’s audacious platform. Other facets of the October surprise include the revelation that hopes can often be dashed. This surprising assertion will be backed up through the recounting of a story about a real-life student named Bill in Ohio, who really hoped that he would get an A on his Chemistry exam, but still ended up getting a lousy C minus. ,President Bush gave no hint of this animosity in his address, however, congratulating the Democratic Party on its majority position and noting how pleased he was that Nancy Pelosi continues to be a woman, despite the fact she is Speaker of the House. His attitude was refreshingly kind and compassionate throughout his address. At one point, he even stepped into America’s shoes and chided us gently about our flagging patience for and our profound disappointment in the reality of this egregiously mishandled war. “Every one of us wishes this war were over and won,” said Bush, looking quite dapper in his pale blue silk tie, “Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk.” America begrudgingly agreed with the President. Tim Smith of Easton, MD rolled his eyes and sighed, “Yeah, I mean I’m no asshole. I just wish…Nevermind. It’s fine. No, really, it’s fine. No, if you want to stay in the war I do too. You’re not forcing me, I really want to.” Privately, Smith sang another tune, mouthing “So annoying” behind Bush’s back.,Smith admits his ego was bruised when Bush pointed out Dikembe Mutombo and Julie Aigner-Clark for their special commitment to “heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice”.  ,“When he started talking about our special and generous character, I thought for sure I would get a mention. What does Mutombo do? Play basketball. Whatever. It’s so biased. But I guess it’s because he’s from some place in Africa. What with Barack Obama, everybody’s going koo-koo for cocoa puffs.” When asked if he was referring to Black people as “cocoa puffs”, Smith merely mumbled incoherently and turned bright red. ,It occurs to the writer that she has just written an article on the State of the Union address from last year. She would revise her previous comments, but she is tired, and pretty sure it was basically the same thing.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/week_in_review2/,"

"Driving through the backwater mountain towns of West Virginia can be a taxing experience for anyone—especially if you’re a pudgy pseudo-intellectual from New Mexico whose only point of Appalachian cultural reference consists of the oft-spotted McDonalds-Texaco-Pizza Hut triple-threat rest stop. Adding to an ever-growing feeling of bemusement was the smorgasbord of conservative talk-radio filling the cab of my roommate’s Ford F-150. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m all for tuning in to hear how the other side thinks; after all, it keeps the ol’ intellect spry. How striking it was, then, that so many of these pundits—all of whom described themselves as ardent social conservatives—were supporting Mitt Romney, the former Governor of Massachusetts, in the 2008 Republican Presidential primary season.,Given what I knew about Romney’s record as Governor, it seemed an unlikely union. Before entering the Presidential race, Romney espoused liberal positions on hot-button social issues ranging from gay rights to healthcare. Most notable of all was his stance on the third rail of American social politics: abortion. During his 2002 run for Governor against Democrat Shannon O’Brien, Romney openly touted his pro-choice credentials. In an AP story published in October of that year, Romney announced that he had been endorsed by the New York-based Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, and that his mother, Lenore Romney, had been a strong supporter of abortion rights during her 1970 bid for the US Senate. Romney’s running mate Kerry Healey also told the AP that “there isn’t a dime of difference between Mitt Romney’s position on choice and Shannon O’Brien['s].”,The early years of Romney’s term bolstered his pro-choice credentials. Section 16M of Romney’s health insurance plan mandated the inclusion of a representative from the Planned Parenthood League (a leading abortion rights group) on the MassHealth policy advisory board. Romney did not object to the League’s membership, nor did he push for the inclusion of an anti-abortion representative. And while most Republicans would tend to avoid any association with that body, Romney and his wife Ann attended a June 1994 Planned Parenthood fundraiser; Mrs. Romney also donated $150 to the organization. Romney’s healthcare policy unconditionally offered abortions for a $50 co-pay, and in October of 2005, Romney signed into law a measure which would qualify some 88,000 low-income residents for family-planning services, including abortion counseling and ‘morning after’ pills.,Soon after leaving the Governor’s mansion, Romney began to sing a different tune. In early visits to the key primary states of Iowa and South Carolina, Romney began the delicate task of distancing himself from his own record on abortion. In an interview airing on Meet the Press in October 2007, Romney argued that, although he had always been personally opposed to abortion along moral and religious grounds, the political constraints of dealing with a hyper-liberal Democratic legislature had led him to bite the bullet on various health bills containing pro-choice provisions. And who am I to impugn the sincerity of his answer? After all, as Romney (rightly) pointed out during the most recent Republican debate, the expert on a candidate’s opinion and thoughtprocess is the candidate himself. While I have to give Romney some style points, his staff continually bumbled about the issue. A high-ranking Romney staffer put it this way to The National Review: “Governor Romney’s seeming support for abortion rights was a seeming [sic.] ruse to win an election in a Democratic state.”,While this unfortunate staffer was summarily dismissed from the campaign, I think we should all give him (or her) a nice pat on the back for pointing out the elephant in the room. Like other fair-minded political observers, I don’t begrudge a candidate the right to change his or her mind on an issue. Policy decisions guided by ideology are rarely successful in achieving their aims (just ask our current President); they are oftentimes counterproductive. When someone in public office changes her mind on an issue, it tells me that her brain is still functioning, having by some miracle not fallen ill to the intellectual anemia plaguing our political system.,What bothers me about Romney, however, is the almost cavalier way in which he has disavowed his record, and the willingness of those learned radio-pundits to drink the Kool-Aid. As a practicing Roman Catholic who feels a twinge of guilt every time he sees a “you can’t be both Catholic and pro-choice” bumper sticker, I can personally attest to how difficult squaring both political and religious views,on this issue can be. After all, it strikes simultaneously at my belief in the dignity of human life and the inviolability of the freedom of choice. Perhaps the good Governor did undergo some radical change of heart, correlated only with the political realities of the 2008 Republican primary. Nevertheless, one has to ask: what does this conservative reawakening on abortion tell us about Governor Romney, about his own values and the degree to which political forces can influence even his core beliefs?,While government by ideology alone is not desirable, neither is leadership devoid of any commitment to some greater idea—be that justice, equality, or the sanctity of life. ,Adding to my consternation is the virtual free ride Romney has enjoyed from some pretty hawkish conservative personalities. Thinking back to 2004, I seem to remember how Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter cornered the market on vilifying presidential candidates from Massachusetts who dared to think differently today than in the past. Flip-flop, anyone? But Ann and Rush have more than made peace with Mitt, forgiving him this one instance of Kerry-like behavior. In the days leading up to the Maine caucuses, Coulter vowed that, if John McCain were to win the nomination instead of Romney, she would gladly vote for Hillary Clinton. After all, “she is more conservative than him [McCain].” Wow. And not to be outdone, Rush Limbaugh has labeled Romney the true conservative in the race. To be fair, McCain has himself become far more conservative in his stance on immigration, taxes, and gay rights. So why is the ‘flip-flopping’ working for Romney and not McCain?,Perhaps what bothers Rush and Ann so much is exactly what McCain has been trying to underplay in his campaign: that while in office, the Arizona Senator has and will play by his own rules. Throughout his congressional tenure, he has broken with the Republican platform on immigration and taxation, as well as on gay marriage. Romney, on the other hand, knows how to play the political game all too well. Unlike McCain, Romney has a reputation of being able to fall in line with the party faithful, and I think this is what some of these pundits are banking on. While he may not have been a poster child for conservative values as the Governor of Massachusetts, it seems pretty clear that what he does in office conforms to the political will of the electorate. In other words, Romney is predictable. It is little wonder, then, why he has been given the title of conservative standard-bearer, in the hopes that, unlike McCain, he will hold the party line once in office. ,This certainly is an instance of image politics at its best, which makes me think that whoever said politics is the art of perception was a genius. Maybe this is how the game is supposed to work. Romney’s selective, new-found conservatism could also be interpreted as an instance in which the people have asserted their will over those who govern them. But shouldn’t competitive elections pit different candidates with differing viewpoints against one another?,If everyone decides to follow the party line, is competition really possible? It seems to me that democracy’s truest victory occurs when candidates win and lose because of the positions they hold, not because of their ability to re-craft themselves from one election to the next.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/the_fifth_column/,"

"Since the turn of the twentieth century, admission into America’s most elite colleges has always been a straightforward matter of selling out. The days when pure wit garnered fresh high school graduates passage into the academic aristocracy have faded like an aged daguerreotype. Our places of higher learning say they have spotted something past the hemispheres of the brain—fixated their eyes on a strange substance that cannot be sifted through the monotonic sieve of a Scantron. In fact, this thing, so amorphously defined, is referred to only by the shapeless sobriquet of Character, and over the years numerous apparatuses have been formulated to capture its diffuse shades: the personal statement, the interview process, the Jung 16-type personality test, the handwriting analysis. Every year new techniques aiming to draw out the applicant’s true character bud into practice. Most rely on the use of intimate essay prompts, asking applicants to respond wholeheartedly to questions one might expect to hear on _The Dating Game_. Some applications go as far as to ask about the applicant’s favorite word, quotation from a film, ice-cream flavor, and animal. Differences aside, every prompt believes itself to be a spyglass into a person’s soul. Yet in those hurried weeks spent filling out college applications, I kept thinking to myself that these questions matched, nearly line for line, the makeup of my childhood conversations:,_“Who is your hero and why?”_,“Spiderman. He can sling webs and defends us from the bad guys.”,_“What was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you?”_,“When my swimming trunks came off as I was getting out of the pool.”,_“What is your favorite animal?”_,In the fourth grade, I believed I shared a unique, soul-to-soul bond with a certain playmate because the two of us thought okapis were the coolest animals in the world. We were best friends back then because we appreciated the virtues of the same African ungulate. Things just are not so black and white anymore. And maybe college admissions offices realize this as well.,Perhaps the perennial shifting of the college application indicates the admission committees’ own lack of confidence in their measuring sticks. Many colleges now even offer applicants the option to create their own essay prompts, clearly in hopes that applicants might know better what to ask themselves. Still other schools, like the University of Chicago, take a more experimental approach, perhaps in hopes of catching the applicant off-guard by asking an array of the most Carrollian questions. The essential intention of all these essays seems to be to find out exactly what sort of person each candidate is—or seems to be. Although the motivations for such probing seem sound, the results are often uncertain. For the smartest candidates know what the personal essays have come to be all about and use this knowledge to their advantage. When a prompt asks for an applicant’s role model or his or her most hard-earned life lesson, the admissions officer on the other side does not really care about the obvious objective of the question. Exactly whom the applicant admires or what the applicant learned is a MacGuffin. A thousand candidates might write about how much they admire Barack Obama or about seeing the true value of diversity or the importance of family or teamwork or any other highly regarded value that might make the candidate seem like an admirable individual, but, in the end, college admissions is a filtering process in which the bland or poorly executed applications congeal into inseparable chunks and the unique, captivating candidates pass on through with a shimmer. Ultimately what has come to matter is the way the applicant crafts his self-presentation. The substance of Character has been distilled into the age-old Hollywood pillars of story and production. With a whole slew of services boasting names like The Ivy Coach, Ivy Insiders, and Ivy Success, there is now a whole industry centered on entertaining the admissions committees with the most astounding personal memoirs and profiles of the most fascinating and well-spoken individuals. The concept of individuality, once natural and spontaneous, has become institutionalized into a perverse art form.,Taking these recent trends in college applications into account, Tufts University’s latest admissions supplement, a short video essay of around a minute in length, does not seem revolutionary or unexpected at all, but rather the natural capstone of the modern college application. A Tufts admission officer states sincerely in his admissions blog, “I’m a huge fan of our supplement, and asking me to pick which essay prompts I like best is like asking me to pick which ice cream flavor at Tosca- nini’s is my favorite.” Lee Coffins, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at Tufts, states he first came up with the idea of the video essay while on YouTube. “I thought, ‘If this kid applied to Tufts, I’d admit him in a minute, without anything else.’” Admissions officers are clearly jaded by the intimate rag of personal es- says, and are looking for something more engaging. To be fair, if I spent every day in Toscanini’s I’d be a little jaded of ice-cream as well. Yet, the distinction between impressive and entertaining can often be a fine line to draw, and the distinction between academic potential and impressiveness may be an even finer line to draw, especially when exactly what is taken to be impressive is something as loosely defined as Character, and the candidate knows just what antics a bored college admissions officer might find refreshingly entertaining. Admittedly, Tuft’s new “U-Tube” supplement blatantly confounds all these qualities.,A smattering of candidate videos shows many to be quite fun and lighthearted. One candidate combines her loves of “being a nerd and dancing” through performance of the Math Dances, products of her own invention. One dance imitates an x,y-scatterplot, another a sin and cosine wave, and yet another a pie chart.	Her dances give the impression of an inside joke with herself, and her repressed jolts of laughter after each dance reveal that her slight embarrassment. She comes off as creative, unconventional, and spontaneous. Other videos show strong desire for admittance. One video is from a girl who recently had surgery on her jaw. She raps about her operation with rubber bands in her mouth preventing her from overextending her, apparently still aching, mandibles. This painful performance highlights her resilience. She seems to be grimacing through half her lines, but clearly she is determined to get into Tufts and this video not only shows her commitment, but also places her within the ranks of other broken-jaw rappers such as Kanye West. Still, the final question is whether these applicants would have recorded themselves in such compromising states if not for a chance to lighten the final judgments of an admissions officer. Probably not.,Yet many videos are essentially slideshows of action shots of candidates doing something that may be deemed interesting or impressive. Watching an action shot of one candidate posing in a West Point polo shirt at a summer camp with a bold-faced caption exclaiming “Leadership,” I could not help being reminded of the shameless self-promotion of the infamous Aleksey Vayner video résumé, “Impossible is Nothing,” which circulated virally across the Internet a couple of years ago. The video featured Vayner, an applicant to UBS AG, pumping big iron, ballroom dancing, and talking to the cameraman about the secrets to success. The video also featured spliced in footage of a skier—who was not Vayner—performing a perfect 360 ̊ and of a black-belt—who was also not Vayner—karate chopping a stack of seven bricks.,Sure, the Tufts video essays are less overblown and less conspicuous than the extremes of “Impossible is Nothing,” but the same underlying sentiments are still there. And I don’t blame them. In times when our elite educational institutions treat Character as a commodity, as a substance to be panned out like gold to gild their halls with, no enterprising students should be blamed for offering themselves up as shining caricatures.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/getting-selling-out/,"

"Joanna Newsom must be the most enigmatically fascinating figure in indie music today. Though she’s shrouded in a barely-tangible sense of cultured innocence—her closeness with her astrophysicist and musician siblings, her compositions and lyricism refined by academia yet bejeweled with joy—she’s ended up working with some of the most formidably famous people in the business and come off not a scratch more cynical. Considering that her initial recommendation came from Will Oldham, most famous for the gorgeously dark album _I See a Darkness_, that she’s dated Bill Callahan, the eminent pioneer of despairing lo-fi, and that she’s been produced by such industry gods as Steve Albini and Jim O’Rourke, it’s astonishing that she’s managed to keep such a Björkish pixie-like aura—even more so that her most recent body of work seems to reflect a deepening of that early endearing childlikeness.,Consider her new album in context: six years ago, having barely gained the full rights of adulthood, this inimitable Ms. Newsom let loose upon the indie freak-folk scene _The Milk-Eyed Mender_, an _arpa_-centric album with mysteriously mature lyrical leanings and articulation apparently due to an Appalachian matriarch. So meteoric was her subsequent rise in acclaim that no less a Name than Van Dyke Parks was recruited to embellish her orchestrated follow-up, the prodigious pentaëpyllion _Ys_—a work of art less personal and less warm, but far more grand and grandiloquent, shocking in the scope of its ten-minute verbal aristeiai, and (with some notable exceptions) attracting even more acclaim than its predecessor. The hypothetical follow-up full-length LP was greatly anticipated—but, as she then reminded us, the meteorite was the source of the light, while the meteor was just what we saw. For three years, her ostensible shyness prevailed—the meteorite hurtled towards a destination we could not conceive, and we saw no more of her asterism.,Until this winter, when—her brainchild having heretofore been kept under preternaturally heavy wrapping—the project, tentatively titled _Have One on Me_, was revealed to encompass no fewer than eighteen songs and three separate discs, terrifying those who’d shied clear of the relative sumptuousness of _Ys_. Surely such a staggeringly stupendous _magnum opus_ would be even less accessible, with none of the homey happiness and innocence of her _début_. Besides, triple albums, especially extravagant ones, have historically tended to be more stuffed with filler—there are far more _Sandinista!_s in the world than there are creations of the caliber of _All Things Must Pass_. Wouldn’t this be disaster?,But such fears have turned out to be unprecedentedly unfounded. Joanna Newsom has brought to the table, in complete modesty and not even a modicum of vainglory, one of the densest and most gorgeous feasts of popular music since—well, unless _Blueberry Boat_ can be counted to be dazzlingly beautiful in an intensely unconventional manner, this might be the most simultaneously layered and emotionally transcendent work of popular musical art since _Pet Sounds_. Such lushness is accomplished through no massive orchestra; rather, through a couple of handfuls of session musicians, producing a sound much more suited to chamber music—far more understated than the adornments of Parks, yet still tickling to both the brain and the ear, incorporating not only folk and baroque but jazz, blues, piano pop, and even some mild rock influences.,In her first showcase to the world, lead single “Good Intentions Paving Company,” Newsom chose a batch of _bric-a-brac_ that stuck with stylistic through-composition, but, to the consternation of some, the song lacked her trademark harp and timbral quirks. The Appalachia previously exhibited in her vocal style departed with the arrival of a new aesthetic more reminiscent of Kate Bush; the Americana expressed throughout her previous work manifested itself instead in alt-country instrumentation—subtly honky-tonkish piano supported by banjo, mandolin, drunken house brass, and, for the first time in her history, drums and percussion! I am sure some purists of the _Milk-Eyed Mender_ school fainted. I myself was somewhat skeptical that such an artistic leap could be pulled off—but just as “Good Intentions…” can’t be defined by a single passage in its structure, neither can _Have One on Me_ be defined by a song, nor even an individual disc.,Instead, one must recognize the themes swirling and resplendent throughout this tertiary triumph. _Ys_ was oft-described as a song cycle—not unreasonably, given its autobiographical quality—but _Have One on Me_ is an encapsulation of her entire oeuvre to date, a triptych blending that storytelling magic so perfectly exhibited in _Ys_ with the sentimental sentiments that characterized _Milk-Eyed Mender_.,Even within the first disc the harmonious dichotomy is clear: such fabulous fables as the title track and “No Provenance,” taking up the mantle of the _Ys_ian travelogue, are interwoven with the life-affirming string-laden beauty of “Easy” and pure harp simplicity of “’81,” in which Newsom sings and stresses oh-so-softly: “I’m your little life-giver; I will give you life”; “I was born to love you, and I intend to love you”; “I believe in innocence, little darling; I believe in everyone.” It seems that her journeys from home are taking her such wonderful places as she has never before seen—but things turn sinister with the start of the second disc. “On a Good Day,” which could pass for a pure 14th-century English folk tune, sees her speaking to a lover: “Will you leave me be, so that we can stay true to the path that you have chosen?”,The parting of the paths finds her “squinting towards the East” (“Jackrabbits”), drawing analogies between her misogynist host and a vicious Indian prince (“Go Long”)—possibly the most vicious lyric she’s ever released. Yet she hasn’t lost her sense of love—looking back home in “Occident,” she asks, “Lord, is it harder to carry on, or to know when you are done?”, and, seemingly having made her choice, speaks possibly the defining lyric of the record: “To leave your home, and your family, for some distortion of property? Well, darling, I can’t go. But you may stay here, with me.”,Somewhere along this path of pervasive prowess, one notices the lack of wildness in her voice—it’s grown and developed far beyond its previous appearances. This shift in vocal expression is due to quite possibly the most devastating and influential event in her life in the past few years: in spring 2009, Newsom, who had won the hearts of hundreds of thousands with that ineffably peculiar intonation, was diagnosed with vocal cord nodules, not only eliminating her voice, but also preventing her from fully expressing her emotions. “In fact,” she stated in an interview with the _Times_, “crying was the absolutely worst thing I could do to my voice. So I was constantly telling myself, don’t feel, don’t feel, don’t feel.” She emerged from the condition after two months, though not unscathed—her formerly “untrainable” voice (by her own account) developed a richer, more mature nature (“I may have changed. It’s hard to gauge. Time won’t account for how I’ve aged,” she sings in “Autumn”). Her songwriting, on the other hand, shows something remarkable. She’s taken as great a pleasure as she can in once again being able to express herself, and has done so in practically every way possible: not only is her music more evocative of beauty and emotion than ever before, but her lyricism allows for an unabashed celebration of not only deep love but _feeling_. It’s a cathartic eruption, albeit one of the least disturbing and most comforting emotional explosions ever placed on record.,_Have One on Me_ is a candescent crown to Newsom’s career, more accessible yet accomplished than anything she—or any former freak-folk figure—has attempted previously. Most of all, she seems perfectly settled in this style, the union of her first two attempts at stairways to heaven. Certainly, she found first panegyric with domestic personalism, then set out into the unknown in search of the mystic Ys—but it seems as though the destination of such a journey was the warmth and love of home all along, and she’s fully contented to be there. And as this realization has resulted in such a superlatively towering and passionately moving achievement, I, too, am more than happy with home as her place of rest.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/well-daring-i-cant-go/,"

Press “Next” to find a new person!,I was sad to see him leave. I thought there was potential for us to shoot the shit for a little longer. He seemed pretty distracted with his homework but maybe I was a little too awkward. Idk. I guess he just wasn’t that into me. No worries though. I was beginning to make progress with this chatroulette site and felt my social skills were improving. For the most part the conversations I had engaged in so far were only a few lines of either incoherent banter or small talk that never got past the weather. Quick and with no names, just as it should be done. But while this brevity in madness was all chatroulette needed to do to titillate me, I still yearned for something more. I saw the opportunity this site was presenting me with and I desired to share a meaningful conversation with another human being. What I wanted was a new friend.,I knew this was a difficult task since conversations on chatroulette tend to be only extended sessions of the types of superficial small talk you might have for a few minutes with the person sitting next to you on a plane, only things are much more awkward since it can be unclear what are the appropriate questions to ask. It feels too personal to ask the stranger on the other side of the computer where they live and how old they are, especially since these are the very things I was raised not to tell strangers. There’s a fine line between being friendly and being creepy on chatroulette, but my comfort level wasn’t the most difficult challenge I faced.,In trying to accomplish my goal of finding a new friend, my biggest obstacle was the very demographic that this site attracted. I kept a running tally of all those I encountered, keeping track of gender, age, and whether the strangers were in a group or alone. I found that out of the first seventy-eight strangers I was matched up with, fifty-five were male, twelve were female, and eight were penises. The penises were not very talkative, nor were the men. The majority of the males I encountered were usually reclining in bed, often shirtless, and would instantaneously “next” me, probably because I wasn’t a fine young lady whom they could talk to as they secretly touched themselves underneath the covers. Most of these creepers were of college age, although there were plenty of middle-aged, pedophile-looking men trolling the site as well. Many of these older gentlemen were bespectacled, overweight, and generally looked like one of my substitute teachers from middle school, particularly Patrick Schwab. The one creeper that stood out from the rest was a thin bearded man relaxing naked in a bathtub. Our time spent together was short but chilling as I stared into his cold, dead eyes for those brief seconds. The eye-fuck he gave me was not very enjoyable, nor the type I’m accustomed to receiving.,Yet after my conversation with the religion major things started to change, and the older fellows I was connected with started to talk to me. I discovered that some of the adults shared the same perspective I did about the site.,Stranger: what are you looking for on here?,You: just checking out the site ,You: its interesting technology ,Stranger: yeah, me too ,Stranger: really interesting ,Stranger: i think its super funny ,You: i agree,Stranger: too much cock….and ,Stranger: i’m gay!,You: very true,It was nice to find, though, that someone else saw the same absurdity and amusement in the site that I did, although in retrospect that conversation no longer seems so normal. But this one still does.,You: Howdy ,Stranger: Howdy ,You: how has your day been ,Stranger: boring ,You: i hear you ,Stranger: hows yours going ,You: alright ,You: just need to finish some work up ,Stranger: i just finished a bunch of reports,You: do you have more work left ,Stranger: i think i’m done for the day ,You: thats good,We kept going at it like that for ten minutes. Although he was rotund and bespectacled like the rest of them, I had a feeling from his tidy home office that he was different. He was kind and had gentle-looking nostrils, but it felt like talking to one of your friend’s dads in their living room as you awkwardly wait for your friend to get ready and come downstairs. The worst part about it is: when you sit down in person with a guy, it’s easy to crack a smile and laugh when he tries to be funny. When you’re instant messaging you can type “haha” in various lengths of measure to pretend that you’re laughing. But with chatroulette you can do neither of these two social tricks. In all my conversations, I found it hard to keep a smile going if it wasn’t genuine, so when I chose to type, my “hahahas” couldn’t mask the emotionless expression on my face. Ultimately, while I truly liked the guy, and I mean I liked him a lot, I knew in my heart we could never be more than strangers, so I bid him adieu. There were still 40126 online for me to meet.,Overall, I had the best luck in my conversations with Europeans. For whatever reason, they were the most open to having normal discussions, and as a result I met a diverse and interesting array of people. I met a woman from Norway who was a political advisor, a guy from Tunisia who liked techno music and sunglasses, a girl from France who will be attending architecture school next year, a high school rugby player from Ireland, a college student from Hungary, and many more. The small talk went deep with all of them and I felt like I was starting to get to know these people in a kind-of- sort-of way. Maybe this is what seventeen year-old Andrey Ternovskiy intended for when he created chatroulette; not to create a place to carry out voyeuristic desires but a place where people across the world can learn to better understand one another.,While all these Europeans were awesome no one stood out quite like Christopher Delmarle, an eighteen- year-old high schooler from some town in northern France. I felt our connection was authentic and not random like the others ones. Chris enjoyed playing soccer and Call of Duty and quite frankly that is all I’m looking for in a friendship right now. At the conclusion of our conversation I headed over to facebook, typed his name into the search, and added him as a friend. Now I’m simply waiting until we become Facebook official. I think this could be the start of something beautiful.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/can-you-make-friends-internet/,"

"Andrew Sullivan, a senior editor for _The New Republic_, knew his audience. He did not come to proselytize; the crowd at McCosh 50, he well understood, needed little convincing that gay rights deserve support. Instead, he led us between left and right, alerting us to the political arguments which have shaped the gay rights movement. We should “try to think, rather than feel, about this topic,” he reminded his audience early in his speech. And he constructed this speech methodically; his rhetoric was not purely objective, but sensibly subjective. He divided his talk into four neat segments: Prohibitionism, Liberationalism, Conservatism and Liberalism, which together, he discerned, comprise the politicization of homosexuality. But let us start at the end and slowly work our way backwards to the apex of his provocative analysis: at his compelling discussion of the religious right and the Catholic Church.,Liberalism, Sullivan proposed, seeks to treat gays as an enclave of society deserving of special civil protections. These laws, such as hate crime laws and anti-discrimination employment laws, create a debilitating social atmosphere. And while these endeavors are benevolent, they stratify society and foster resentment within each sect. Sullivan maintained that minorities should arm themselves with confidence and courage, as did the drag queens at Stonewall who fought against abusive police. He suggested that these laws can infantilize a protected group. More importantly, government should never seek to criminalize intolerance. As he emphatically reified the importance of the first amendment, he reminded his audience that “freedom for the bigot is also freedom of the prophet.”,Conservatism involves a reserved approach to sexuality, Sullivan noted, and a reluctance to truly explore and contend with gay rights. This American breed of Conservatism is silent and furtive, avoiding social disquietude and abhorring dissension. But in his speech, Sullivan suggested that such retraction is impossible: “the closet has collapsed” and there is no going back. Rather, the conservative movement should welcome the changing tides. In America, the ousting of closeted politicians has become farcical in nature, and conservatives still contend that gays can be “cured.” Yet, elsewhere in America, groups such as GoPride seek to reconcile conservative ideas with LGBT issues. And in Britain the Conservative Party actively seeks support from the gay community in the upcoming elections.,Then there’s the second segment of his explanation: Liberationalism. This argument is void of religious rhetoric. Rather, these political fractions see homo- and heterosexuality, as social constructions. Under the intellectual aegis of figures like Michel Foucault, this group rejects the existence of a fundamental human nature. Homo- and heterosexuality are simply monikers for neutral, sexual acts. While they vehemently oppose the oppression that gays incur, Sullivan suggested that they perpetuate it themselves; they oppose gay civil rights, as they oppose all such liberties, because they believe such legal contracts to be constraints. Instead, they operate under the term “queer liberation,” which, Sullivan suggests, dilutes the importance of sexuality. Sexuality involves a bond both corporeal and sentimental; to call it a sexual construction is to deny that, “you really can’t help what turns you on.”,At last Prohibitionism, the first aspect of this politicization process which Sullivan discussed, and the first on the minds of the audience. This traditional, fundamentalist notion contends that homosexuality is simply wrong. As Sullivan explained, this notion has dominated the public sphere for the majority of human history and it still permeates the politics of the right. Christians, specifically Protestants, cite the Bible as justification for the immorality of homosexuality. And, quickly, Sullivan acknowledged that the Bible does forbid homosexuality, specifically in Leviticus 20:13. This same verse, however, obligates the death penalty as punishment. Support for such a measure is sparse—those who would support such a notion, the maliciously hateful, for example, are largely irrelevant for Sullivan; of more concern are the seemingly cogent arguments, based on reasoned tradition and absent of blatant malice. This contradiction, Sullivan maintained, negates their argument, allowing Sullivan to shelve the biblical interpretation near the beginning of his speech and to focus, instead, on Catholicism.,Natural law, according to Catholic tradition, contends that God designed humans for heterosexuality and procreation; any deviation is a crime against nature. They argue that revelation isn’t necessary to interpret this argument and, as such, this notion is simply an appeal to reason rather than faith. And homosexuality is not the only transgression that the Church finds inconsistent with natural law. Under the same reasoning, they denounce masturbation and the use of condoms. Both acts break natural law as both involve sexual satisfaction without procreation. Indeed, natural law expands far beyond homosexuality; Sullivan maintained that it colors the entire Catholic worldview. Catholics divide the very universe, Sullivan explained, symbolically between male and female. This notion permeates their teachings, which often exult Mary as much as they do Jesus. But therein lies another contradiction: Jesus never married, and he demanded that his disciples, comprised solely of men, desert their families without goodbyes upon following him. And within the Church itself the most respected luminaries are male and celibate.,In methodical arguments, there is little room for lurid details or fanatical condemnation. So when Andrew Sullivan mentioned, briefly, the ignominious prevalence of pedophilia within the Catholic hierarchy, and the deplorable attempts within the Church to bury such behavior, he did not fixate on moral turpitude. Instead, he cited this as another example of hypocrisy; how can the Church function as the purveyor of natural law while its constituents flippantly ignored these statutes for years? Did Sullivan betray his sensible subjectivity slightly with an underhanded injection of the Church’s humiliation? Maybe. But his care with the subject, easily the Achilles’ heel of the Church’s moral authority, validated his argument. It also validated the argument of his opponents.,Indeed, Sullivan’s treatment of the Catholic Church is both destructive and redemptive. Zealous bigotry is not, Sullivan contended, the defining feature of the Church’s rhetoric; there are arguments that demand and deserve the respect of fair engagement. And who better to deliver this speech, for Sullivan has an invested interest in both sides. As a gay man, he must fight arduously for equal legal protection. But as a conservative and, more importantly, a religious Roman Catholic, he must rationalize the apocrypha that has come to dominate the American Right and the oppression that his church condones. As his speech progresses, and he describes the tumult of his childhood, and the hurt he has incurred by his church; his creaking voiced and moist eyes betray his emotional investment. But his speech is overwhelmingly level-headed, and his engagement with Catholic discourse replaces spite with respect and rage with reason.,Andrew Sullivan is a walking contradiction. The very fact that this gay man, fiercely religious and passionately conservative, should base his speech in the importance of consistency seems puzzling. But his statement, ultimately, is important, especially for Princeton. From our vantage point, it is easy to see the transformations of the political Right, but the cogent details within their arguments often escape our view. The religious right, Sullivan explained, does not consist simply of zealous demagoguery; there are arguments that deserve our consideration. Yes, these arguments are flawed, inconsistent and disconcerting, but that does not mean that they don’t exist. ,Sullivan showed that the Catholic Church does, perhaps, have definitive arguments that warrant our respect. But how does the discussion of natural law truly influence the political sphere, much of which does cling to a selectively literal interpretation of the Bible? I contend that it is important for Princeton students to acknowledge, understand and perhaps join discussion on natural law, but ultimately I question its pragmatic worth. Has Andrew Sullivan worked to decompose a theo- logical debate that most Americans never truly consider? Perhaps he catalogued that biblical discussion towards the beginning of his speech too early. While we learn to acknowledge extant arguments, we must understand the limits of discourse. Are these debates rooted in corrupted, philosophical reasoning—or is a larger, emotional catalyst responsible? If the latter is true, then Sullivan’s careful, thorough rebuttals may prove ineffectual. Perhaps Sullivan reveals, challenges and engages pressing questions, which may ultimately complicate matters. But behold his rich identity and his engagement with seemingly inconsistent discourses, which synchronize to form one compelling thought. This theological paradigm, this cobweb of questions, does not belong to the public sphere. But his patient, precise consideration of each argument buoyed from left and right—his panoramic view of politics—most certainly does.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/out-and-devout/,"

"As you might have guessed, the _Nassau Weekly_ is full of a bunch of super-nerds who are really into books and junk.  To give you an indication of how into books they are, consider this: Every week, they have their meeting in a _library_.  Also, once, no lie, I saw an editor cut a hole in a book, fill it with melted butter, and make love to it. (If you want the pictures, hit me at dabromow@princeton.edu.),So when the editors found out that one of their favorite books, _The Inferno_, by Dante Alighieri, had been made into a video game, they positively flipped their shit.  This is not hard to understand, since statistically speaking, 99% of video games are 100% rad.  I could show you the math, but you wouldn’t understand it.,Because I am the only one on the _Nass_ with both the upper body strength to carry a Playstation across campus and the minimum level of hand-eye coordination required to play a video game, I was selected to play, consider, and write up the dang thing.  So I did.  You’re welcome. ,_The Disclaimers_: ,Please bear in mind that my total playing time only adds up to about three hours.  It was due back to Blockbuster in five days, and time is money, and I’m not made of money, goddamn it.,Please also bear in mind that I have not read and really know nothing at all about _The Inferno_.  I am functionally illiterate.  How did I write this article, then?  Good question! ,_The Premise_: ,The protagonist of _Dante’s Inferno_, this is the game I’m talking about, is the titular Dante, a crusader in some crusade.  While off crusading, Dante somehow _significantly_ fucks up in a way that is mysterious enough to have details about it doled out over the course of the game.  He comes back from crusading to find that his house has just about been entirely ransacked.  Not only that, his woman Beatrice has been stabbed in the chest and is, medically speaking, dead.  This would be bad enough if it weren’t for the fact that Satan shows up and takes her soul to Hell.  During all this, though, her boobs are entirely on display for basically anybody to see, so it’s really pretty hard to be upset about the whole situation, but I can see where you’d be coming from if you were.,Obviously, Dante’s having none of this, and bam, we have a plot, just like that.  Go get her, tiger!,The main things that the real Dante Alighieri did, as I understand them, are 1.) almost single-handedly invent the modern Italian language and 2.) not wield a scythe made out of human bones.  The main things that the Dante Alighieri of _Dante’s Inferno_ does are 1.) wield a scythe made out of human bones.  This historical discrepancy is never really addressed in a satisfactory way.  I’m also not sure the real Dante ever did the following: stitch a cross made of red cloth onto his chest, tear the undead in half with his hands, leap like twenty feet on a regular basis, or ride beasts.  Luckily, _Dante’s Inferno_ Dante isn’t a total fucking lameo like his real life counterpart. ,_The Experience_: ,The game starts off while you’re still out a-crusading and absolutely laying waste to a bunch of identical Muslims to such an extent that they literally become a bloody red mist by the time you’re finished wrecking their sorry selves.  But look out, Dante!  A sneaky Arab drops a dagger in your back, causing Death to be like, “Whoa, get a load of this guy.”  Obviously, this is a non-issue for you as Dante, who basically approaches the fact that Death himself has come for him like no rational person would: he wails on the skeletal motherfucker for ten or so minutes with an enormous poleax.  This yields results, and bam, Dante’s got a fly-as-hell new scythe for the mantle.  That you just annihilated Death doesn’t seem to be handled as a particularly serious thing worth being concerned about.,But so like I said before, you realize upon returning that some serious shit has gone down in your absence.  Any normal person would be like, “Well, I should do my best to rebuild the shattered fragments of my life and go through the grieving process with quiet dignity.”  As we know, though, Dante Alighieri is off-the-charts batshit and decides to pursue Satan and his lady-friend and wail on him with an enormous poleax until the situation is resolved.  Anyone else who gets in the way will basically receive the same treatment.,As you start tearing the denizens of Hell so many new assholes that their asses look like showerheads, you start to rack up your soul count.  You can then use these souls to purchase new abilities or improve old ones.  These are categorized into “holy” and “unholy.” Holy abilities tend to involve counterattacking and shooting crosses out of your chest.  (Did I mention that you shoot crosses out of your chest?  You shoot crosses out of your chest.)  Unholy abilities are generally exciting new ways of absolutely ruining somebody’s day with the business end of your human-bone-scythe.  You can accrue more souls by grabbing enemies, at which point you are given the choice of punishing or absolving them.  Punishing them results in Dante dismembering them in so brutal a manner as to make the elderly weep, while absolving them results in me calling you a pussy.,You also learn magic.  The religious implications of this are staggering. ,Along my way, I encountered a variety of enemies.  Here are those that I came up against in my time with the game:,Shambling corpses – These are roughly as threatening as a really angry child whose arms I have cut off.,Horrid flying things – Shoot these fuckers with crosses from your chest until they are dealt with is my advice to you.,Demons – If you look closely, you notice that they don’t actually have horns, but a hat with horns on it.  Once you realize this, you wonder, who makes their hats?  Are they regulation, or does everyone bring their own to work?  Dante’s Inferno doesn’t seem to want to tell me what’s going on with that.,Enormous, fire-breathing hell-beasts – After you take out the asshole up top, you get to ride these harder than a furry in a barnyard. ,You also encounter the souls of famous people who have been condemned to torment and are given the choice of absolving or condemning them.  In my time playing, I came across Pontius Pilates and Orpheus.  I absolved them, because everybody needs someone to cut them a break now and again.,Eventually you make your way to the ferry that takes you to Hell.  An unholy vessel, it echoes with the screams of the damned as they are loaded in droves, naked and shameful.  In this regard, it is a lot like the Staten Island ferry.  Unlike the Staten Island ferry, however, it has an enormous head on the front that spouts annoying slogans like “Abandon hope, all ye who enter,” and “Every kiss begins with Kay.”  You’d have to be some kind of man-child not to realize as soon as you see the giant head that you’re going to rip it off, and sure enough, after climbing around for a little while, doing a “puzzle,” and seriously murdering a number of individuals, you do.  And then bam, Hell time.,This is the point at which I stopped playing.  I feel like I have a pretty solid grasp on what the game was all about from that point onward: Go through Hell one level at a time, dealing with the particular brand of motherfucker served up by that level, until it’s time to go toe-to-toe with the big man himself.  Based on my limited knowledge of both the game and the source material, here is how I imagine the rest of the it goes: ,First level – Sin of Dickishness – People here are generally pretty rude, and it’ll definitely get on your nerves pretty quickly.  The whole place is set up like an RMV office and is just on the whole unpleasant.  Souls encountered: Napoleon, the principal from _Saved By The Bell_. ,Second level – Sin of Wizardry – This place is chock full of the dirtiest fucking wizards around.  Had I played this, this would have been my favorite level, because I hate wizards.  The second level of Hell looks a lot like my living room, as set up during my third birthday party.  Souls encountered: the magician from my third grade birthday party, financial wizard Matthew Lesko. ,Third level – Sin of Being the Lead Singer of Journey – If you stop believing, you lose, kind of like the horse in the swamp in _The Neverending Story_. Souls encountered: Steve Perry, Robert Fleischman, Steve Augeri, Jeff Scott Soto, that Filipino guy they picked up from the cover band. (How crazy is that? I mean, guy fronts a Journey cover band, _and then gets picked up by Journey to front Journey_. I would lose my shit.) ,Fourth level – Sin of Pretension – REHASHED JOKES ABOUT INDIE MUSIC AND FILM.  ESOTERIC REFERENCES.  GENERALLY SNIDE TONE.  Souls encountered: Dash Snow, John Updike. ,Fifth level – Sin of Community Service – Didn’t know it was a sin?  Neither did they!  God is full of tricks.  The fifth level is a one-room schoolhouse, which you furnish with modern amenities.  Souls encountered: Cesar Chavez, Lyndon Johnson. ,Sixth level – Sin of Being Wrong – Everyone who has ever been wrong about anything ends up here.  It’s a real shit-show, all around.  The sixth level looks like the set of _The Weakest Link_.  Souls encountered: Charles Darwin, whoever invented the electronic drum kit. ,Seventh level – Sin of Laziness – ,Eighth level – Sin of Will Feinstein – This is a level made entirely for William Watkin Feinstein.  He knows what he did.  It looks like his house, and smells almost as bad.  Souls encountered: Will Feinstein (hint: condemn). ,Ninth level – Satanopolis – This is where Satan lives. It looks like a house, but with horns.  Stab him until he’s got more holes than a Dan Brown novel.  Then, fuck your girlfriend. ,You win at literature!",http://www.nassauweekly.com/human-bone-scythes-poleaxes-death-and-boobs/,"

"Most people think Boulder is a ski-town.   They are probably right.  But in fifty years, I would not be surprised to hear that most people think Boulder is the Shangri-La of the fifty states.   Can you imagine Lhasa transfigured into a half-college, half-resort town, replete with snowboarders threading the base of a miniature, coniferous Himalayas like raindrops down a coral clad swami’s balding scalp as he exchanges metaphysical quips with college kids in Volcom sweats?   If you can do that, I’d say you have Boulder pretty well pegged.  There is a booming yoga community in New York City, in Las Angeles, in Boston; in just about any major city you’ll find people doing yoga, but there is no other city, that owes itself to this practice, that offers itself up to its calling, the way Boulder does.  The streets of Boulder are studded with Yoga Studios and Tibetan Restaurants. Shambhala Buddhism was founded here, and the golden stupa atop the central temple stands tall over downtown Boulder.  If you take a stroll along Pearl St., the city’s central commercial artery, you’ll find souvenir stores that’ll make you second-guess you’re not in eastern Nepal.  But before arriving in Boulder, I was like anyone else.  I thought Boulder was just a ski-town.  ,Understandably, I saw many eyebrows rise quizzically when I told people I was going to spend my spring break in Boulder doing yoga as part of a civic engagement initiative.  Colorado of all places to bend your back!  Yoga of all ways to lend a helping hand!  To make matters worse, I knew little about yoga.  I had once held myself in Warrior II pose on my parent’s copy of _Wii Fit_, and had even done a few headstands in my high school cross-country days (purportedly helps to drain the lactate from sore calves).  I had seen other people—yogis—bend their bodies into grotesque convolutions seemingly named after the flora and fauna of a traditional haiku: eagle pose, child pose, downward facing dog pose, dolphin pose, boat pose, standing tree pose, falling tree pose—ouch!  Was yoga Sanskrit for contortionism?  If not, where lies the dividing line?  I could offer no convincing rejoinders to those raised brows.  All I could offer as demystification was what anyone who had read the compact mission statement on the application website could offer.  The weeklong yogic sojourn was an enterprise endorsed by Princeton’s Pace Center aimed at exploring how yoga could be used for community building, self-inquiry, and empowerment.   We were going to teach yoga to underprivileged populations.  The venture even had a neat all-summarizing title that you could fold and fit snugly into your pocket: Yoga and the Practice of Nonviolence: Boulder, Colorado. The concept sounded less tenable with every approaching day, less grounded in reality and more like a caprice in new-age idealism.   Looking back, these shades of cynicism, which I saw as a mark of a learned skepticism, was nothing more than the wrinkles of a nascent disillusionment that I would later seek to abolish. ,We were twelve of us blowing westward into the Boulder Valley, mostly yogi wannabes hardly able to hold liquor legally, barely able to hold the padmasana for too long.  Our trip coordinators, the campus yogi Elizabeth Cooper and dancer Nisha Rao, guided the rest of us into the ancient arms of the Rockies partly by way of preemption, partly by way of dharma.  A kind yoga instructor and entrepreneur responsible for a new caffeine-free energy drink had offered his homestead in Longmont, so out of the Denver airport in rented Ford Flexes, we rolled toward the Boulder suburb right away.  We got into the Valley too late the first night to see all the Buddhist prayer flags hanging over the Boulder shops and restaurant counters, to see the town painted with those crazy rags of elemental colors blue, white, green, red, and yellow.  But the constellations did not dim, and the first sounds heard upon reaching our place of stay was “Oh my! Oh stars!”  The wind was probably howling a transcendent mantra, but here the sky opened itself to us revealing hidden diamonds, and I was too busy staring into the great lucid darkness above to listen.  What other shrouded jewels would I find here?  There were days to listen, days to stretch one’s arms out.   In the morning, looking into the mountains, I remembered Kerouac’s Sal Paradise lying under a Longmont gas station, half-dosing in his last respite before reaching Denver for the first time.  As he had seen them, the snowy Rockies and the tremendous old trees are all still there among the rolling farm fields that have sat browning all winter, stunning the beholder into a naturalistic submission.  The air was crisp and clear; visibility was high—at about 5000 feet above sea level, the air was light, almost flighty, and breathing called for a conscious pull of the lungs.  But every full breath seemed to fill me with a vastness I had not known.  I would learn in the days to come that yoga is balance itself, and breath is the most vital balance of all.  As we coursed through the roadways from Longmont to Boulder, I felt equalized and absorbed into the grandeur around me, and my eyes trained themselves to appreciate the space between things. There was so much of everything all spread out immensely.  The specks of cows grazing lazily, studding the honey-bleached landscape, the horses rushing along the grass and carrels, the plains stretching far away, filling in where there wasn’t anything else, the clouds stretching even farther, the air pure and invisible, the cars and the people all on their ways to somewhere, anywhere, someplace. ,Now, I am not a historian with any formidable knowledge of Colorado, but the infrastructure of its history that I do know is the part that intersects with my own journey:  In 1974, the supreme abbot of the Surmang monasteries and the eleventh in a line of Tibetan lamas, Chögyam Trungpa, moved into Boulder after his escape from Tibet to India and his studies in Oxford to found Shambhala International—a meditation oriented school of Buddhism aiming to create an enlightened society—and Naropa University, which is just one of two accredited Buddhist universities in the United States.   That same year, Allen Ginsberg (who, as a Haré Krishna swami purports, was the first to put the Haré Krishna chant to the oriental wail of the harmonium and the boisterous rhythm of a drinking song) and New York poet Anne Waldman helped Trungpa establish Naropa’s school of Writing, the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics (_disembodied_ because Kerouac was dead at the time of founding).  In the following years, the school became a hotbed for contemplative psychology, religion and spirituality.  Inevitably, Naropa’s spiritual gravity drew in our yogic voyage. ,A short walk from Pearl Street, Naropa University is a snug set of buildings located a few hundred meters outside of the Colorado University campus, just past the geodesic football stadium.   Walking onto the compact campus green, we were greeted by a collection of floating stones underneath a sycamore tree.  Closer inspection revealed the stones to be hanging from mesh wire tied to the large boughs above.   As I discovered these seemingly magical rocks were indeed supported by a real foundation, so I came to see that the alternative practices studied at Naropa are grounded in robust philosophies.  After interacting with the students and faculty in fields such as somatic intelligence (neuropsychology of the peripheral nervous system), traditional Eastern arts, and peace studies, the underlying principle was evident: the attainment of a universal balance—yoga. ,Yoga comes in many forms.  Hatha yoga is what most people envision when they hear the word yoga.  It is the practice of attaining physical balance in posture and breath, in hopes that the mind and spirit will follow suit.  Another form is Raja yoga, which Ghandi himself practiced fervently—striving for perfect balance through meditation, balancing the mind.  There is also Karma yoga, which seeks for balance by helping others.  It is an interpersonal yoga of altruism.  Karma yoga is essential for all social workers, for how can one help others put their lives back in balance if they themselves are listing unsteadily?  All of these balances are inextricably entwined.  Healing and helping others requires guiding another out of pain and struggle, but in doing so, one must sympathize with that pain and struggle—taking the suffering into oneself and making it one’s own turmoil.  Thus yoga admonishes us that the suffering of another is akin to one’s own.  Helping another escape such suffering moves oneself out of pain and struggle.   But such internalization of the suffering of others leads to the possibility that one will, in overcoming this suffering, let go of the other’s hand in selfish escape.  Thus the practice of yoga calls for constant communication between the altruists and the victims, for a helping hand must pull both parties out of the mire.  Though I gravitated toward this ideology, I still wondered how teaching yoga to special needs patients, underprivileged Latino mothers and children, and the homeless would address the issue of nonviolence. ,Nonviolence is an interesting agenda for a civic engagement mission because, as the word reveals, it involves a negation of action.  Taking the statement at degree zero, our little group was completely successful in accomplishing our nominal goal; not a single fight broke out among us, not a single streak of violence showed itself—save a small incident involving a fellow yogi stumbling into a rocking chair in the dark, and if bacteria should be so construed as to wage warfare against our immune systems, one of our ranks fell sick for a couple of days to strep and another was convalescing from a recent bout of pneumonia.  None of the group really thought our agenda touched on the issue of nonviolence.  It seemed that to truly address nonviolence there must be violence present to begin with, but there was none to be seen, none the day we taught the homeless, none the day we taught the underprivileged Latino families, and none the day we taught those special needs patients. ,On the plane back, reflecting on discussions with local yoga gurus, a fellow yogi brought up the idea of how, as college students, we myopically fashion our minds toward our pursuits in times of high stress, while neglecting other essential parts of our lives, such as proper dietary and sleeping habits.  This is a subtle violence imposed upon us everyday; its existence owes to the entropy of the universe.  Violence is a destruction of desired order, an annihilation force.  In this way, despite the lack of bloodshed, violence presents itself to us day to day.   Thinking back on our episodes of service, a whiteboard on the wall of the homeless shelter said “No fight in 576 days.”  The stress of the homeless life wipes away serenity, incites anger and frustration. Most of the underprivileged mothers must have never expected to perform yoga—such a chic fad that belonged to the world of the affluent—another bar separating them from the well off, imposing a violent pressure against their egos and self-image.  Those special needs patients also seemed awfully scrunched up into their own little worlds, absolutely frightened of interacting with the outside world.  They felt a violent vibe from the world and in retaliation addressed the world with turbulent attitudes.  One patient kept giving us the middle finger.  Another would cast glares from his corner.  This was violence stemming from misunderstanding, an imbalance in trust.  After each of those sessions, everyone seemed more calmed, in balance with the world, and the yoga seemed to make sense.  When people feel perfectly balanced with themselves and with each other, there is no need to tilt the order with violence.  With such insights I found myself growing idealistic, as my soul began a yoga-tropic expansion and the old wrinkles of cynicism stretched away into inexistence.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/community-service-reimagined-2/,"

"NW: So how have things been going here for you at Princeton?,
SS: Pretty busy…making the transition from high school to college.  I’m trying to do my best to manage my time well and to balance sports and academics.,NW: So far how well do you think you’ve adjusted to living in the United States?,
SS: I think I’m doing a good job. I’m watching my eating habits, which I guess is the most important thing.  Other than that there isn’t anything really different except the language.,NW: Are you at all homesick?,
SS: Not yet.,NW: Now, why is that you run?  I mean, what’s at the other side of the track that makes you want to get there so quickly?,
SS: Well, I’m really ambitious.  It’s always a great feeling to beat other people, but it’s more about the feeling of running.  When I sprint it feels like I’m flying over the track, which is just as good as flying in the air.  When you are running those long strides it’s like NEEEEOOOOW!,NW: How long have you been running for?,
SS: Overall, I have been doing track for 10 years, but competitively maybe only around 6 years.  Around then I would practice 5-6 times a week, but it wasn’t until 3 years ago that I started to practice every day.  ,NW: At what point did you realize you had the potential to become as fast as you are?,
SS: Honestly, I never thought I could be faster.  I always just listened to my coach, and then I just did it.  I would always hope I could run faster, but always thought I reached a new limit. I guess I made my biggest jump four years ago when my PR (personal record) in the 200 meters was 24.0 seconds, and in the next race I ran 22 point something.  My coach was all like “Holy Shit!”…I’m always the kind of guy who is surprising his coach—smoking his expectations.,NW: What goals do you currently have for yourself?,
SS: Right now, I first have to get healthy and get back to running.  Then the most important thing is that I get through the winter without getting sick, so I can run well in the spring.  At that point if I train well, I would like to run maybe around 20.7 seconds for the 200 meters and 10.4 seconds for the 100 meters.  And if the coach wants me to run the 400—I don’t know what my potential is—but maybe I could run a 47.5.  Also, the Olympic standard for Germany in the 200 meters is 20.59, and I want to run that within the next three years in order to qualify.  Also besides the Olympics I am hoping to qualify for the European under 23 championships next year.,
  ,
NW: How often do you think about 2012 Olympics?,
SW: Not often. I like to always focus on the next practice. Step by step.  If you already think of those kinds of goals, you are giving yourself too much psychological pressure and people will expect more of you.  I don’t like that pressure.  Dealing with it has always been my biggest problem. I think I have it in my legs to run the standard, but I know my head needs to be in the game too.  I need to learn how to deal with that kind of pressure.  That’s why I’m happy that Princeton has a psychological trainer… it’s really, really cool.,NW: Why did you decide to attend Princeton?,
SS: First I wanted to study at an American university because German universities don’t have sports teams, as there isn’t enough time to study and train.  So staying in Germany would have meant the end of my track career.  And for me, academics have always been more important than athletics.  So since I wanted to study math, I looked for a university with a really good math department.  Luckily Coach Samara was so kind as to recruit me.  ,NW: What will be harder, Princeton math or your Ivy League competition?,
SS: (laughing) At the moment the math is harder.  That’s also what I need to focus on first.,NW: So whom do you consider to be your competition?,
SS: Honestly, I don’t know yet.  I have never competed against American runners.  So I don’t know them, and I guess they don’t know me either…yet.,NW: Do you hope to emerge as the dark horse of the NCAA who everyone comes to fear?,
SS: I hope they will be shocked and petrified! (laughing) Yeah. I want to surprise and beat everybody at Heps.,
  ,
NW: What was it like competing at the German National Championship?,
SS: First it was really intimidating thinking of running against all those super fast men.  But then that huge audience made me get this tunnel vision during the race.  They were cheering, and I was just running as fast as I could.  Since it was the Men’s Championship, I had nothing to loose, because I was still in the junior age group.  So I didn’t feel any real pressure in that race, since I had nothing to lose running against those old men.  ,NW: What other big meets have you competed at?,
SS: German Junior Championships, Øresund games in Helsingborg, Sweden, and the Deutschland Track Association Meet, which was the final race for the Olympic qualifiers… I am a member of the B-Squad of the National German Team.  To get on the A-Squad you have to earn a medal at an international meet. So, for example, the fastest German sprinter is only a member of the B-Squad.  The B-Squad is made up of all of the athletes who can compete internationally for Germany.  Germany sets stricter time standards for the B squad than most international meet standards, because they only want to have runners who have a chance at making it to the finals.  ,NW: Now at the age of 21 you are a little older than most freshmen. What accounts for this age difference? ,
SS: In Germany we have 13 years of school.  4 years of elementary school and then 9 years of high school.  And then the second extra year comes form mandatory civil service, which is an alternative to mandatory military service.  I served in a nephrology center, which is a hospital for people whose kidneys are malfunctioning.  I would order the supplies, help take care of the patients, and I also took care of the nurses by getting them coffee and food.   It was just like a normal job—five days a week for nine hours a day.  So that was quite a difference from before when I just had high school and then practice.  It was tougher, but it was okay.,NW: Do you think this helped you prepare for college in any way?,
SS: I think it did because I learned to get into a work rhythm, to do things I don’t like, and how to deal with death and sickness.  I also learned to appreciate the work of people who did the dirty jobs, since I was one of them, and to value everyone’s contribution to society.,NW: During this civil service year what team did you compete for?,
SS: So the name of my club was Greifswalder SV04.  It was a small club; we had maybe only 20 people.  But my coach was really good, and he may actually start working for the Qatar Sports Academy of Excellence, which has one of the best facilities in the world.  The ages of the members of my club ranged from twelve to forty or so.  We would all compete together at the state level, but only myself and a female distance runner were fast enough to qualify for the national level.   ,NW: Are you excited to compete now for Princeton Track Team?,
SS: Absolutely! I am so looking forward to running for such a good team, because I will be able to run on a really fast relay, and there is a really great team spirit that I have never experienced before.,NW: What will be the biggest adjustment you will have to make from training with your club team to training with the track team?,
SS: Well, I’ve already found out that there is a lot more competition during practices, which, on one hand, I like since it pushes you to your limit, but on the other hand, maxing out during practice doesn’t lead to the best training results…so I need to watch my pacing more. But I’m good at that.,NW: Ultimately what do you view as the key to your success?,
SS: The key to my success is that I enjoy pain, but only when it’s about sore muscles.  Really, though, I think I’ve been successful because of my ambition and my focus on my goals.,NW: Thank you, Sebastian.,
SS: Thank you.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/interview-sprinter-sebastian-steffen-13/,"

"I don’t know much about performance art. In fact, I didn’t even know it existed until I met artist Saba McCoy a few weeks ago. Still, neither her nor Wikipedia’s explanation was entirely clear. The only thing to do was to experience it for myself. Unfortunately, now having attended Performa 09, supposedly the most prestigious performance art festival in the world, I am only more lost and confused about what the hell performance art is.,My first impressions of Performa 09 were formed at the Performa HUB, the festival’s headquarters located at the new Cooper Union building in the East Village. There I saw my first performance, “Pasta Sauna” by Marije Volgelzang. The installation was a small, freestanding square room constructed from plywood and plastic tarp located in the corner of the HUB. Inside, three “performers” in white jumpsuits stood on ladders and made pasta for the “audience” with music boxes. The steam from the cooking was trapped inside the room, creating a sauna-like effect that made the audience feel tired and lethargic, which, according to theorists from the futurist movement, is the same effect that eating pasta creates. At this point, I could have marveled at the piece’s artful irony or debated whether or not it constituted art, but instead I chose simply to be grateful that these affable strangers were so insistent that I be fed.,So reserving judgment and maintaining an open mind, I opened up the Performa 09 schedule—a three-foot by three-foot, haphazardly organized program that is nearly incomprehensible.  Without reading the description I chose Ylva Ogland’s “Snöfrid Ruby Distillery.” Had I bothered to read it, this is what I would have learned about the piece:,“‘The Ruby is for the core of Lust…for the connection to the uncontrolled controlled.’ The artist’s mirror twin will enter the earthly world through an ancient alchemical process, made present as a distillate of rubies…. ‘We serve me from the distillery, so that you can drink me.’”,“Snöfrid Ruby Distillery” was held at the Swiss Institute, which was located on the third floor of a building down in SoHo, where in order to be buzzed in I actually had to ask for the “Snöfrid Ruby Distillery.” Upon getting inside, I was led by the receptionist down a long narrow hallway and through several pitch-black rooms to a small studio space.  There I found a scantily clad woman and a man with a beard, ponytail, and no comprehension of English hunched over a mini-distillery while a Peter Jackson lookalike lurked in the corner carving homemade corks with a large kitchen knife. Although all of my instincts told me to run away, I ended up talking to Peter Jackson, who explained to me how the installation worked. The woman and the bearded man were taking perfectly good champagne and distilling it with rubies to create 168 proof alcohol—for what reason, he did not seem to know. He further explained the purpose of the cooling system, actually a giant pot.  Apparently it and only it prevent the whole concoction from exploding. I suddenly noticed the numerous fire extinguishers and the terror-stricken look on the bearded man’s face.,The other—and perhaps oddest thing—I noticed about the installation was the fact that I was pretty much the only attendee. During the forty minutes I stood there, the only other people to show up were a friend of the two artists and their assistant, hardly the turnout one would expect from what is supposedly the largest festival of its kind. Before I left, they offered me some of their moonshine. Mindful of my frail underage body I politely declined and headed off to my final installation: “Mother Earth Sister Moon” by Princeton’s very own Christian Tomaszewski.,The physical construction of the installation “Mother Earth Sister Moon” was rather interesting. Inside a giant room surrounded by windows on the ground floor of a building right in the middle of hectic midtown lay a giant hollow spacesuit on its back. The suit was modeled after Russian Valentina Tereshkova, the first female astronaut in space. The performance took place inside the spacesuit: a futuristic sci-fi fashion show depicting a world that Communist regimes of the former Soviet Union may or may not have imagined.,Inside the spacewoman, fifty or so audience members found their seats on the floor while one performer lounged in a chair and another, a barmaid, served only milk. Models entered one at a time through random zipper-like entrances placed around the interior of the spacewoman. The outfits ranged from plausible to extreme, the most absurd ones being a woman with a dead body tied to her back and a woman dressed up as a giant umbrella. As this went on, cacophonous music played from outside the spacewoman, giving the whole thing an eerie vibe. After all of the models came through for a second time, the show ended. The woman lounging in the chair got up, walked over to the barmaid, drank a glass of milk, and left.,The sternness of the models juxtaposed with their absolutely ridiculous outfits made it impossible not to laugh, and I wasn’t the only one who thought so; over half of the audience was laughing. The performance certainly had interesting concepts and themes, but in the end it was just too ridiculous for a performance-art-newbie to take in, analyze, and retain.,Ultimately my one-day excursion to Performa 09 has led me to conclude that there isn’t much to performance art that makes it meaningful or worthwhile. While they go out of their way to be weird and abstract for the sake of trying to justify their work as art, performance artists might be better served if they acknowledged the fact that performance art is art and focused more on trying to make good art. Then again, I did only see three performances. Maybe if I had seen the Thursday night premiere of “Jesus Christ is a Sausage” I might think differently.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/if-performance-art-happens/,"

"Most can agree that eating on a daily basis is pretty damn important. And aside from an ever-growing contingent of foodies who want their leafy greens local, chemical-free, and cooked very slowly, that’s about the extent of the collective awareness (look no further than the recent Double Down from KFC if unconvinced). But a new contingent of culinary artísts is acting to expand the way we conceive of our fodder. The official field of molecular gastronomy is a new and succulent beast, though its founders’ interest and inquiry into old wives’ tales suggests that amateurs, too, have theorized on the same old queries for centuries. The co-coiner of the phrase “molecular gastronomy” and former Oxford physicist, Nicolas Kurti, was rather indignant about the kitchen’s separation from academic study: “I think it is a sad reflection on our civilization that while we can and do measure the temperature in the atmosphere of Venus we do not know what goes on inside our soufflés.” ,The current big wigs of the industry, Hervé This and Ferran Adriá, are leading the exploration into these processes, one in the lab and the other in his world-class restaurant elBulli, respectively. Both employ chemistry apparatuses that any nerd would swoon for—we’re talkin’ titration burettes, rotary evaporators, vacuum chambers, and nitrous oxide canisters for the foaming of unusual items (read: meats). These make for a most interesting, if not entirely substantial, carte de jour; liquidized olives that pop in one’s mouth like a balloon are complemented by the foie-gras cotton candy. Kellogg’s paella—it snaps, crackles, and pops! and is eaten with forceps— and tobacco flavored crushed ice are some of his more bizarre concoctions, but surely serve to keep things interesting throughout his thirty course meals. ,Adriá opens elBulli, situated in rural Spain, for half the year, only serving 8,000 in that span despite the two million dining requests. Ranked as the best restaurant in the world for five of the last eight years, one can only imagine as to how it operates at a loss, barely sustainable only due to Adriá’s more profitable pursuits—lectures, trainings, and writing. Ferran Adriá is a much-admired figure, though controversy plagues him due to assertions that he is in fact poisoning people through his cutting edge chemical tinkering. Oh, well! It was probably worth it…,In reviewing Adriá’s new book, Anthony Bourdain, host of food travel show “No Reservations,” may have said it best: “Pastry chefs everywhere—when they see [his book]—will gape in fear, and awe, and wonder. I feel for them; like Eric Clapton seeing Jimi Hendrix for the first time, one imagines they will ask themselves ‘What do I do now?” One of the more mysterious assertions of the Top Chef’s Wikipedia page is that “Adrià has made almonds into cheese and asparagus into bread with the help of natural ingredients.” I honestly do not understand it, but there it is ladies and gentlemen—the guy is pure magic. ,The pairing of certain ingredients like cocoa and cauliflower, or marshmallow and parmesan, may seem strange until one considers the importance these chefs place on “mouthfeel,” which is a much more nuanced definition than that all too familiar sensation of, well, tasting something. Foods are categorized throughout mastication based on nineteen factors that include fracturability, mouth coating, moisture release, and uniformity of chew and bite. The quantitative analysis of heaviness is determined by the item’s weight. That seems straightforward enough. Force and energy come into play when testing for gumminess and viscosity, however, which leads me to a fantastical image of scientists in lab coats, all strapped into their chewing monitors and chomping down on giant carrots. You might ask yourself why, following the ingestion of spinach, one has that strangely-gritty-and-yet-squeaky-clean mouthfeel. Oxalic acid is the culprit. This type of investigation is just the tip of the iceberg lettuce, and Adrià has decided to close his restaurant so he can limit his focus to the creative exploration of avant-garde cuisine. His culinary physics class scheduled for Fall 2010 at Harvard is wildly popular, signifying the extent to which molecular gastronomy has infiltrated intellectual circles. Or perhaps it signifies the extent to which we all love food. Either way, this futuristic cuisine has crossed the pond and is likely to inform our opinions on the proper use of foam and forceps in the coming,years.,_Cooking Myths Debunked:_,Adding garlic before onions in the frying pan? Nope. Add the moister ingredient first.,Three minutes to the perfect boiled egg? Hervé suggests four hours in an oven of 68 degrees Celsius.,Sear your meat to lock in the juices? Don’t.

"Nassau Weekly: There’s a huge community of magicians in Paris. How do they distinguish themselves? Do they pick a look? Do they have individual styles?,Graham Jones: Well, that’s a vast question. You know, there are different subgenres of magic, so already in terms of the type of performance they choose, they already kind of classify themselves. They classify themselves according to the style of performance that they choose. So, one of the basic distinctions concerns the scale on which they perform. So they sit there—stage magicians, close-up magicians— that’s the basic dichotomy. And there are kind of increments between them—so, like, parlor magicians, salon magicians— but the basic distinction is between stage and close-up. So a close-up magician does tricks right in front of an audience, in direct conversation with an audience, whereas a stage magician is separated by the stage itself.,NW: They might ask for a volunteer?,GJ: They might ask for a volunteer, but the audience is not as active a participant in creating, in determining the flow of events.,NW: Does that mean—I’m sure this is another really complicated question—but does that mean it requires a certain degree of skill to be interacting so intensely?,GJ: It requires a huge degree of skill [laughs], yeah. There are perpetual quarrels between stage magicians and close-up magicians about whose work demands more artistry, whose work demands more talent. Because a stage magician has to master all of the skills of acting, of theatrical presentation, of movement; many take courses in dance and pantomime, and they have music and costumes; and it’s a different kind of choreography—it’s a show. So they liken what they do to more theatrical forms of entertainment. Close-up magicians, while they have to think about all those things—their clothing, their body language—really focus overwhelmingly on their hands, things they do between their hands. So it demands, in many ways, more dexterity, more virtuosic skill than, say, the kind of dexterity it required to make a woman disappear from a box. The box does the work, and the woman in the box does the work! The magician just points at the box, let’s be clear. And there’s a whole kind of Marxian analysis you can do about the mystification of women’s labor in magic. But, the thing that close-up magicians really have to think about is, as you insightfully point out, they have to think about how to successfully interact with a public that may or may not be interested in seeing magic in the first place. Because whereas a stage magician is performing in a situation where people have come to a theater or a cabaret, to see him or her perform—close-up magicians mainly do what they call table hopping, which means they’re in a restaurant or at a bar or a special event, and they’re just walking around, they’re perambulating around, and doing performances for small groups of people, or tables, and those people aren’t necessarily expecting a magician to come, and they may be talking about something else, they may be fighting, they may be having a break-up, someone is proposing marriage—you never know what people are going to be doing! Magicians have all these horrible situations that they walk into, unwittingly, or horrible things that they say by accident, unwittingly! This is what I’m writing about this morning, actually, which is why I’m feeling very inclined to talk about it. There are all these strategies that they use to establish what I would call a frame of play, a comedic frame, a frame of play that allows, that makes people well-disposed to engaging in this experience of mystery and imagination. But it’s hard, too—interactionally—because basically what a magician is doing is displaying skills, or displaying abili- ties, that are incomprehensible by design. And so basically what they’re doing is showing a secret to people, and saying, implicitly, “I know this and you don’t”—there can always be a combination of power or competition. So particularly when you’re just cutting into a group of people that aren’t expecting it, you have to be very savvy about defusing the potential for antagonism or competition or hostility.,NW: Right, I can see that.,GJ: And I think that that’s one of the reasons, historically, in terms of the psychology of it, that magic is such a masculine, a male-dominated practice, with so much masculine symbolism. I mean, obviously there are historical reasons for that and you can look at the history of the evolution of the art, but whereas many other performing traditions, you know, have much more gender parity now, magic remains overwhelming male-dominated. And I think a part of it is precisely because of the attractiveness of these themes of competition and aggression, not just to men, but particularly to adolescent boys. [Laughs.],NW: Have you seen the show Arrested Development?,GJ: No, no.,NW: Do you get this question a lot?,GJ: You know, I have a little sticky note on my bulletin board to see it, because of the magician, yeah—I mean the boy.,NW: I think it would be very interesting for you. I mean it’s a great show besides that, and like the , characters.,GJ: I should—I’ll do it this summer, I’ll watch it this summer.,NW: That’s a great time to do it! So, are we [the students of ANT 433] right in thinking you’re working right now with Christian magicians? Did you mention something about that? ,GJ: So this project on magic kind of exploded in all these different directions because what I found in doing research on magic, is that [it] really is a topic that scholars have shunned in a way, because I think there’s an assumption that it’s culturally trivial, that it’s something that doesn’t merit sustained,
scholarly attention. ,NW: You mentioned that, with being in France, with your little notebook.,GJ: Yeah, Paris. There it’s especially bad, I mean, people just—other academics made fun of me all the time.,NW: [,] So you’re used to this bullying?,GJ:That’s worse! So one of the things that’s a challenge for me is that. I think that’s changing; there is some interesting stuff that’s come out now. But there’s still a lot of work to be done, and one of the things that I’ve been trying to do in things that I’ve written about magic, is to show precisely that it’s not culturally trivial at all. One of the magicians that I worked with said something that I thought was brilliant: he compared magic and opera. And he said, “Opera is a high art that deals with trivial matters. Magic is a trivial art that deals with matters of the highest importance.” Which I think is true! You know, it’s really about a kind of dancing on the threshold of illusion and reality, what is real and what is not. What could be more profound metaphysically than that? [Laughs.] So I’m trying to do this, write this book about entertainment magicians in France. What they’re doing is entertaining. They’re not necessarily thinking about these profound questions about the nature of reality. I mean, that’s not really their job, and so that’s not really a part of that book, but I think that to be able to write about the subject, I had to kind of examine some of these questions in greater detail. And so that pursuit led me to look at areas where the meaning of magic gets very blurry. Entertainment magicians, sometimes they kind of toy around with esoteric imagery, or supernatural themes. You know, you might see an iconic poster of a magician with a little devil on his shoulder or something like that.,NW: Is it spooky?,GJ: Oh yes, spooky! You know, it’s a joke, it’s a trick that’s kind of nominally about a ghost. But, in reality, they’re operating within a cultural frame in which there’s absolutely no expectation that audiences will attribute any supernatural significance whatsoever to what they’re doing. If there ,, they couldn’t really do that as a form of entertainment! But I think that one thing I wanted to do—I’m sorry this is a very roundabout answer! One thing that I’ve wanted to do is look at the way that that relatively safe and unproblematic framework in which entertainment magicians operate has been culturally constructed over time. How it’s an historical accomplishment. So one of the things I’ve looked at is encounters between Western travelers—explorers, missionaries, colonists, merchants—with non-Western indigenous traditions of slight of hand performance.,NW: Looking at other people’s ethnographies, this kind of thing?,GJ: Looking at old ethnographies, you know, things from the 1600s through 1900s. And one of the things that you find is Western observers often make very invidious comparisons. They say, “Well, look, these people have tricksters just like we do, but the difference is that , believe it’s real, and , know that it’s false,” which generally when you look at the reality of things, it’s much, much more complicated than that. Generally I would say that those kind of imputations of credulity to non-Western peoples are almost always wrong. The reality is almost always much more complicated. But what’s interesting to me, given what I’m doing, is the reflex that these Western observers have to attribute credulity to other people, and incredulity to themselves. And that’s where you see it, that Western magic is something that really is connected in a deep way with assumptions about modernity, what it means to be modern, and what it means to think like a modern person.,NW: Rationality . . .,GJ: Rationality! It’s connected with the story of rationality and the disenchantment of the world. So when you see a magician perform, there’s the subtext of disenchantment or rationalization that makes it all possible. So the thing with Christian magicians that I got really interested in was the way—insofar as entertainment magic as most people know it today is predicated on a kind of distinction between magic and religion, that they’re doing something very different from religion—I was interested in the way that Christian performers, who have a supernatural message or religious message to convey, could use this medium that has a problematic relationship to the supernatural; either because it is so closely associated with secularism or disenchantment or rationality, or because it’s so closely associated with the miraculous and performance as miraculous. The thing that I’m interested in is how they use magic as a form, a medium of communication, but are very careful to distinguish it from forms of paranormal occurrences that they believe are real: miracles. The miracles of the Bible.,NW: They’re not claiming to—?,GJ: Not at all. And they’re very careful to frame what they’re doing as fundamentally different from Biblical miracles.,NW: Kind of just hinting, though? Do they, in their magic, provide some sort of watered-down depictions of what could be possible with the Lord?,GJ: Yes and no. Everything they do is metaphorical. They use the imagery of magic metaphorically, and they remind audiences that it is only metaphorical. So they would never, except for someone who was really inexpert, really clumsy— all of the ones that know what they’re doing, which is most of them, systematically avoid doing anything that resembles Biblical miracles. So they would never, say, produce loaves of bread or turn water into wine. They would—so for instance, they’ll turn water into blood, to symbolize the blood of Christ, but they would , turn water into wine. It could be the same trick, right? It’s the same visual illusion, but they’ll always do something on the theme of blood—turning water into blood—they would never say water into wine, because basically what that would suggest—and they’re very perspicacious on this point—what that would suggest, is either that Jesus was a magician and that the Biblical miracles were just tricks, or that they themselves were charlatans, trying to usurp the divine prerogative of producing miracles. So either way, they have to steer totally clear of that kind of stuff. So that’s very interesting to me, is how they, in the course of performance, manage this very precarious symbolism of what they’re doing. They have to be very savvy about it. So it’s cool!,NW: That sounds super interesting. I’m kind of curious about what courses you would teach ideally, if you could do anything. Besides this one [ANT 433], of course.,GJ: Well, this course is one of my ideal courses. You know, this is my first time teaching it and I’m really happy with how it’s going. There are some things I would do differently, some things that I didn’t do quite right. In terms of the content of the course, I’m really happy and I feel like, I mean, I can’t speak for the students but I feel like everyone is really engaged with the material and people are doing the reading. So I think it’s very exciting. I’ll be, you know, next year I’m starting a job at MIT.,NW: I didn’t know!,GJ: I’m just on a post-doc here. So I’m starting a job at MIT and actually there I can teach whatever I want: because there are no anthropology majors! [,] So there are no requirements. So I’m kind of teaching the things that I want to teach. So I’m teaching, my first year I’m teaching a course on language and technology, looking at the interaction between communicative practices, practices of communication, and forms of mediation, from literacy to chatroulette, from writing to chatroulette. And so I’m really excited about that, because it’s an area that—the thing that’s great about teaching if you do it well, and you know, I’m a neophyte, I’m just starting to hit my stride, but when I look at my own professors, I see that the best teachers are the ones whose classes are very open-ended, and who continuously learn from their students; so that they’re driven by a spirit of curiosity, where you’re not just regurgitating things again and again, year after to year, to a nest full of baby birds. But there’s really some kind of back and forth where it’s the engagement of the student that keeps the subject interesting to you. So that’s what I really want: my courses to all be open-ended in a way.,NW: To continue your process of life-long learning.,GJ: Exactly. Pedagogically, I’m still trying to figure out how to do that, how to make a course that both imparts an established body of knowledge but remains open-ended to the unknown, remains amenable to encounters with the unknown. So that’s why in this class you guys are doing these projects that apply a kind of relatively stable body of literature to the understanding of something totally unprecedented. And I’m excited to see what you do. So I’m teaching this course on language and technology, and then I’m teaching a course called “Fun and Games,” on the anthropology of playing in a cross-cultural perspective. But partially, I just wanted it to say on people’s syllabi, “Fun and Games.” I mean not on people’s syllabi, on people’s transcripts! “Fun and Games.” It just looks so bad, you know. [,] It’s good to foster a playful spirit in students. Here, too, especially, I think people take themselves too seriously. [,] And it can be stultify- ing, for students to take themselves too seriously.,NW: Well, thank you! This was fun. ,GJ: Thank you.,Nassau Weekly: I want to talk a little bit about France.,Graham Jones: Okay. [,] I know a little bit about France.,NW: A little bit! How long did you spend there?,GJ: I spent probably off and on, probably something like two or three years there. But I’ve been, I mean, I’ve been going back and forth for—,NW: Visiting—visiting friends? ,GJ: Yeah, since I was eighteen. ,NW: Oh my gosh, okay.,GJ: So . . . that means ten, six, sixteen years? Fourteen years.,NW: Fourteen years.,GJ: No! Sixteen years, sixteen years. [,] Because I’m thirty-four.,NW: In what part of France did you study, with the magicians?,GJ: Paris!,NW: Paris. That sounds great!,GJ: Yeah, France is such a centralized country. Per capita I wouldn’t say there’s any more magicians than here, but it would be like if you took all the magicians of Las Vegas, Atlantic City, New York and LA and put them in one place. Everything is really concentrated there. It’s the same in academia. Academia is crazy there because it’s, like, so focused on Paris that everything happens by personal connections and a few people in power wield so much patriarchal influence—a few people of influence wield so much patriarchal power that everybody is kind of neurotic.,NW: You see them at a party, or something and—,GJ: You just see them around, you know? It’s not like here. I mean here, you know, you see people, like, “Oh! It’s Cornel West.” Or you know? [Laughs.] But, the United States is big enough that people have room—,NW: There are different spheres.,GJ: Different spheres of influence. So there’s a kind of—and it’s the same in magic, you know. Paris is funny, because it’s simultaneously this immensely dynamic place but that dynamism is also kind of constrained by the kind of neurotic sense of competition [laughs] that people have with each other. It’s, like, very cliquish, you know.,NW: There’s almost a neurotic sense of competition here on campus, sometimes.,GJ: Oh yeah! ,NW: For sure. How is it different? ,GJ: You mean among students? ,NW: I mean among students, yeah, definitely. ,GJ: I mean that’s a fundamental part of human nature. ,NW: I guess so… ,GJ: But certain environments amplify it. ,NW: I think Princeton might be one of those.,GJ: I, yeah, Princeton is a little bit perverse in that regard, because of—I don’t want to say anything that I’ll regret. [,],NW: No need! You went to NYU, is that right? How is it different from NYU?,GJ: Princeton? Well, oh god, I really have to be careful about what I say. [,] Have you ever seen the show ,?,NW: No.,GJ: It’s a really good show about—what’s her name. Do you remember that show ,?,NW: Yeah, definitely.,GJ: Lisa Kudrow on that show. Right after, I think in about 2005, she did the show on HBO, about this washed-up sitcom actress, who makes a comeback, and it’s kind of like a reality show, like ,, but she’s just so awful, so awful, in a really painful way. And she looks like she’s going to cry in every scene and you just feel… And she always goes like this, time out, time out—so she can say things off the record. But it’s obviously inefficacious. But NYU, you know, NYU is an interesting place. I found it disappointed my expectations in some ways about what grad school should be. But I think that grad school is inherently very disillusioning, because most of the people who go to grad school have a liberal arts education—I mean grad school obviously in the humanities and social sciences—come from liberal arts colleges, have a liberal arts background. And you kind of imagine, you fantasize that it’s going to be a kind of apotheosis of the liberal arts model and that it’s going to really be about the love of ideas, but it’s just trade school. You know, you’re really slogging along. But NYU is, you know, it doesn’t really have a campus. Life in the city just kind of merges indistinguishably with the life of the campus, which is kind of cool in a way. I mean it keeps you on your toes. You don’t get lulled into the ivory towers. Princeton is the paradigmatic ivory tower, the quintessential ivory tower, the quintessence of the ivory tower.,NW: Yeah, just looking around . . .,GJ: So that was a shock to my system, to come here. And it’s good, I mean it has its advantages. It has its drawbacks, too.,NW: What did you think were the main differences, just in terms of living, in Paris and New York for instance?,GJ: In Paris and New York? The food is much better in New York—so much better. Especially, I’m a vegetarian, and France is a , for vegetarians. It’s really, it’s , slim pickings, and people are really dismissive of the idea of vegetarianism. Really so dismissive in fact that some menus, many menus, almost all menus, they don’t even always specify if there’s meat in certain dishes, so you might order a salad that says green salad with eggs, and it’s just covered with bits of ham. It’s disgusting! And people are really prejudiced against vegetarians, too. My advisor was visiting and we were going to go out to dinner with a friend of hers, and she said, “Oh yeah, my friend,” she told the person, “my friend is a vegetarian, we need to go someplace where [he can eat].” And the woman said, “What’s wrong with him? Is he gay?” Like, what is the connection there?,NW: What a line!,GJ: There’s not, even! Their thinking is a little backwards about some things. But there are some kinds of food there that are amazing. I mean the baked goods, for instance, the cheeses—,NW: Breakfasts!,GJ: —the wines, the open-air markets are great; you get great produce, you know, direct farm, direct produce, but, for vegetarians, New York is much, much better; and restaurants are much cheaper in New York. I mainly have to eat all Indian food there, which is fine, but… I mean when I ate out, which was a lot. Although, Princeton is weaning me of my restaurant addiction.,NW: Really?,GJ: Well there’s just not that many options. And I don’t have a care.,NW: Carol Zanka [department manager for Anthropology] was talking about how she’s lived in Princeton for, like, I don’t know how many years, and they used to have that one—,GJ: I ,.,NW: —that , little joint, where everyone ate.,GJ: It’s not that—it’s pretty, it’s pretty good now.,NW: It’s expanded.

"Salamishah Tillet told her sister Scheherazade that she was a rape survivor when she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the late nineties. At the time, Scheherazade was enrolled in a social documentary class at Rutgers taught by Steve Hart, famous for his seven-year documentation of a HIV/AIDS positive family. In a Penn feminist newspaper, Salamishah had just published the story of her assault by a fellow student, and was becoming very vocal about her recovery process. Hart encouraged Scheherazade to track her sister through the difficult time of reclaiming her sexuality and self-respect. Salamishah agreed to let Scheherazade take a few pictures of her and follow her to therapy. Salamishah said about the initial stages of the project, “anything I was doing that seemed like I was healing she would capture on film.” Scheherazade started documenting Salamishah in 1998 and continues to do so today.,The next year, both sisters were in Boston—Salamishah at Harvard and Scheherazade at Tufts. The Women’s Center at Tufts heard about the project and encouraged Scheherazade to expand it with their support. Thus, SOARS, Story of a Rape Survivor, was born. The multi-media show tracks the process of recovery following sexual assault through photography, dance, poetry, and testimonies. Initially, the students involved were mainly friends of Scheherazade at Tufts. A fair number of them expressed interest because they were rape survivors themselves. The project emerged from what Salamishah describes as the “really intimate relationship” between her and Scheherazade, but it documents the stages of healing common to sexual assault survivors. Now, the show employs professional actors and dancers, picked for their talent and their healthy understanding of sexual violence, essential for the last segment of the show called Speak Out-Teach Back. The actors undergo rigorous training to facilitate this conversation. ,Salamishah currently manages SOARS in addition to teaching here on campus as a visiting professor. During an interview, she remarked on the high level of energy necessary to make each show a success. It is exhausting work, but the audience is very supportive. Often, audience members speak from their own experiences. “It’s always difficult for me when survivors disclose, not because it’s my experience but I’m just so empathetic,” Salamishah explained. The process constantly reaffirms the importance of her work in preventing sexual assault and in helping survivors find their voices and get help. “While we were doing this program on recovery and trying to educate people around how this trauma affects sexual assault victims, we’ve been creating programs that are more prevention oriented. So now we have a program in Chicago called Girl/Friends, which gives young girls the tools to become peer educators around sexual violence. This reinvigorates us. We use the multi-media art model and they also go through a rigorous advocacy training, using the SOARS model to help the next generation to become activists and advocates.”,A Long Walk Home, Inc., a non-profit the Tillets founded in 2003, was inspired by the success of SOARS and the perceived need for more comprehensive training, from workshops on how to support survivors to lecture series on how race informs public beliefs on rape victims and assailants. The new tagline for the show is “_Vagina Monologues_ meets _For Colored Girls_…” (The latter half of the tagline references _For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf_, the late 1970s choreopoem by Ntozake Shange.) The cast has been pleased by the diverse audience at their shows, including people of color and men, two groups who are often underrepresented in the realm of sexual assault awareness. Scheherazade, who acts as the artistic director of SOARS, also works in Chicago as an art therapist and rape crisis counselor.,SOARS’ primary audience lives on college campuses, the ones that have the funding to hire the cast—the show costs $3,000, not including travel costs. The focus on college rape awareness and prevention, which extends to workshops on staying safe from sexual assault while studying abroad, reflects the statistics: only ten percent of college women who are raped will report it. Thanks to SHARE and 14 other Princeton sponsors, a Take Back the Night rally was held on campus last April. (For readers who want to learn more about last spring’s event, equalwrites.org covered it well.) SOARS has been performed as part of Take Back the Night on other college campuses. Those who participated in Princeton’s—or even just considered it—should certainly plan to attend this performance that Suzanne Brown-McBride, the Executive Director of the Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, calls “an incredibly effective, powerfully constructed, and beautifully performed testament to the power, pain and transformative nature of the experience of sexual violence.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/look-soars/,"

"At 11:15 PM, in the grand ballroom of the downtown Philadelphia Sheraton hotel, a small crowd surrounds board 20 at the far end of the table. The rapid clanking sounds echo across the room and attract,more people to the circle of spectators. Five minutes later the clanking stops and is replaced by the steady ticking of a clock. Sitting at the table a portly middle-aged man digs his knuckles into his forehead as he stares at the landscape of wooden figures, ruminating on what could have been. Sitting across from him a boy one-fifth his age and one half his size calmly looks at the board contemplating what type of ice cream he will have his mom buy him as a midnight snack. The boy, knowing he has won, has earned his right to relax. The man, recognizing all is lost, begrudgingly knocks over his white king in resignation. They shake hands and the crowd quietly disperses.,This was the first round of seven at the Philadelphia Open Chess Tournament held over Easter weekend. With a grand prize of 10,000 dollars, this inaugural event attracted 515 players from all over the northeast. But it was just one of the many regional chess tournaments held across the nation in an underground subculture unknown to most.,The US chess world is overseen by United States Chess Federation (USCF), an organization that conducts the rating of tournaments and general promotion of chess. The rating system is a complex algorithm that ranks players according to their abilities. Basically, the higher your rating, the more badass you are., Although few players fully understand the complexities of the rating system, ratings nevertheless take on great importance. Much a like a GPA is to a student, a rating is often perceived as a sense of identity for the chess player. Typically, a player strives to become a member of the Master Class, a rating of 2200 or higher. For a sense of perspective, a good club player will have a rating of 1600, and the highest rating ever obtained was 2855 by Grand Master Garry Kasparov.,The USCF president Bill Goichberg is also the head of the Continental chess Association, an organization that runs the largest tournaments in the country such as the Philly Open. Although there are small tournaments held at local clubs on a regular basis, these large-scale annual tournaments are considered the real competitions, drawing forth the best and brightest of the chess world as well as the strangest.,The stereotypical image of a chess player, the scrawny nerd with bifocal glasses and the social skills of a TRS-80 computer, is sometimes accurate; there are indeed chess players who fit that description perfectly. But in truth a chess tournament is more like a session of the UN general assembly: long, a little boring, and as racially diverse as you can get.,The upper echelons of the chess community are dominated by first and second-generation immigrants from the former Soviet block. Many of the highest ranked players in the U.S. are either Russian or Ukrainian. The intimidation factor of simply having a Russian sounding name cannot be overstated. But other top-notch players also come from India, China, and South America. Chess has also developed a large base in urban communities, attracting both the street hustlers of Washington square and kids from public city schools with budding chess programs.,Leveling out the diversity are the middle-aged white men who used to play a lot when they were younger and know like to play occasionally on the weekends as a hobby. Many of these men tend to be overweight, do not know what deodorant is, and sport sweet seventies porn-star staches. They also have been proudly rocking flannel and plaid long before hipsters invaded the fashion scene.,As for the middle-aged white women there is not much to say, since essentially (and unfortunately) girls don’t play chess. To see one at a tournament is a statistical anomaly. Chess does not generally attract female players; like math and the sciences, it is a male-dominated field. A fair amount of girls play at younger ages but tend to quit by the time they reach middle school or high school. Those who remain are usually,very strong.,A demographic not lacking, however, are child players. While experience can prove to be a valuable asset in chess, age is not entirely a handicap, as the younger players,tend to have sharp analytical minds that can make rapid calculations. Once thought of as humiliation, defeat at the hands of one of these prodigies has become an accepted part of a chess player’s life.,But regardless of age or race, all chess players at these tournaments equally share a great deal of concentration and focus since the average game tends to last anywhere from three to six hours. Rather than using elimination or round-robin systems, chess tournaments typically adopt the Swiss-system of competition in which players play a set number of games and the player with the most wins in the end wins the tournament. These tournaments typically last between three to five days, many over holiday weekends,,and most are held in large hotel chains that offer discounted rates affordable to the average player. A few are held at casinos and two-and-a-half star resorts. Two are held every year at the Bradley International Airport.,Due to the lengths of the games it is common for players never to step outside the hotel during the course of the tournament. This does not seem to be a problem for the chess player immersed in his games, but for the non-chess playing parent this proves to be hell. Eating quickly becomes restricted to the hotel restaurant and elevators have a tendency to break down from overcapacity. High-powered dads will pace back and forth through the lobby with blackberries in hand and blue-tooths in ear. Low-key moms will sit in scattered chairs, patiently reading for hours on end as they wait for their kid to finish playing. But the environment is not very conducive to either activity as stress-filled energy permeates the room with the coming and going of anxious chess players. To escape the chaos, my father would remain in our hotel room during my games and watch Law and Order Marathons on cable TV. This kept him entertained until he realized they were playing the same episodes from the previous marathon, and that by Law and Order they mean Criminal Intent.,However, in the ballroom these toils go unnoticed as the players remain fixated on their games, strategizing every possible way to win. Yet despite the intense competitive nature of the game, the portly man from before quickly shakes off his solemn expression and opens up a smile. Outside the playing hall he and the boy set up a board and review their game, discussing all the various variations they should’ve or almost played. The man is happy that he’s had the opportunity to play a strong opponent and the boy is happy that his mom is bringing him cookie-dough ice cream. While both players may have tried desperately to beat one another, they also realize that chess is just a game.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/blitzkrieg/,"

"Big Star are sacred to me – a summer devotional, everything that John Cusack and Emilio Estevez could never be for me, a holy confessor and mentor.  I would be surprised if that other late auteur of American adolescence, John Hughes, didn’t draw inspiration from their sugar-coated, angst-filled gems in creating his teenage operas.  For me, Big Star crystallized a kind of suburban puberty that is at once personal and catholic. And was I ever a sucker for this stuff.  When I was in high school, I fell in love with my fair share of “September Gurls” (like song’s speaker, I was always a December boy) and found solace in listening to their beautiful, fractured _Third/Sister Lovers_ after a recommendation by a friend.  I quickly bought the rest of their catalog (only two other [hard to find] albums).  So when I heard that Alex Chilton had passed away, needless to say I felt a little heartbroken, as if a part of my awkward childhood had somehow slipped away.,Alex Chilton wrote a soundtrack for every teenager.  He sang about wooing girls and telling their dads to get off my back, driving fast in big black cars and hanging around aimlessly, wishing we had a joint so bad.  And whether you know it or not, you’ve been touched by Chilton, too (bet you didn’t [or maybe you did] know the theme to “That 70’s Show” was Cheap Trick’s [bastardized] version of a Big Star song, “In the Street”). With jangly guitars, big chords, and a voice that sounded perpetually warbling on the side of tears, Chilton and his music, with straightforward pop group the Box Tops and especially with power pop giants Big Star and his ramshackle solo career, has influenced the likes of R.E.M., the Replacements (who have a song named after him that is really quite good), and Pavement (whose ubiquitous “Summer Babe” can be seen as a kind of reworking of Big Star’s “September Gurls”).,Chilton started his career in pure pops.  As lead singer of the Box Tops, a chintzy 60s blue-eyed soul band with a knack for surprisingly complex harmonies and conveying a certain kind of earnestness, he found success with the #1 hit “The Letter” and several minor hits including “Soul Deep” (a real gem) and “Neon Rainbow.”  After declining a spot helming Blood, Sweat and Tears, a project that Chilton deemed “too commercial,” he met up with childhood friend Chris Bell and started Big Star, whose three albums are all perfect and all classics, creating a style that was familiar and referential, yet completely fresh.  They touched on the Who, the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Thin Lizzy, and the Velvet Underground. They still haven’t gone stale to this day.  After three short years together, they split up.  Both Chilton and Bell went on to influential solo careers, Chilton producing the much sought after lo-fi album, _Like Flies on Sherbert_.  After dabbling in rockabilly and blues, Chilton reformed Big Star in 1993 with two members of the Posies (since Bell had tragically passed away in 1978).  They released their final album in this incarnation in 2005 and had plans to play the South by Southwest music festival this year.  He passed away on March 17th of heart troubles in a hospital in New Orleans.,When I found out that he died, without thinking about it, I went to my music catalog and put my Big Star collection on repeat.  And I was seventeen again, just like that.  I came upon “September Gurls” and entertained nostalgic thoughts about my former flames, I mourned silently during the hormonally tragic “Holocaust,” I let “Thirteen” play and felt the giddy optimism of a kid just discovering rock and roll.  Alex Chilton allowed me to detangle and come to understand all the most embarrassing and triumphant moments from my fraught adolescence.

"Next Monday, March 29, Princeton University will begin distributing Census forms to Frist Center mailboxes for students who live on campus. Students will also find another envelope in their mailbox that week, containing a short letter and a pink sticker with the following words:,Attn: U.S. Census Bureau,It’s Time To Count Everyone!,Are you (check all that apply):,[ ] Lesbian,[ ] Gay,[ ] Bisexual,[ ] Transgender,[ ] A Straight Ally,The stickers are a part of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) “Queer the Census” campaign, which promotes the inclusion of a question on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities on the Census. We are working with other students to bring NGLTF’s campaign to Princeton, and are advocating for gender and sexual identity visibility on the Census beyond what the sticker calls for.,Why Queer the Census?,The Census is more than just the government’s way of counting how many people live in the United States. Asking questions on sex, age, household relationships, home ownership, Hispanic origin and race, it helps determine how over $400 billion of federal funding are allocated annually. Furthermore, the Census produces uniquely valuable data because it tries to reach everyone in the United States, unlike sample-based statistical surveys.,The Census has already contributed to LGBT visibility. In 1990, having added “unmarried partner” as a relationship category on the Census form, the Census Bureau accidentally began counting same-sex couples. That year, the Task Force began asking same-sex couples to identify themselves on the Census. Census 2000 data revealed that same-sex “unmarried partners” lived together in at least 99.3% of counties in the United States. More locally, Census 2000 found there were 4,774 same-sex couples living together in Mississippi. State Senator Dean Kirby, the Republican who authored the bill outlawing gay marriage in Mississippi, shares his hometown of Pearl with 55 cohabiting same-sex couples. When the Jackson _Clarion-Ledger_ confronted him with these facts, Kirby replied “Surely you jest. Wow! I have never met any of these people.”,Facts like this can open eyes. As Senator Kirby has illustrated, people are often unaware of the diverse sexualities and gender identities in their communities and hometowns. Census data on LGBT identity can be used to push policymakers to combat hate crimes and promote safe environments for LGBT students and families. The data would be useful in targeting funding for educational programs, such as sensitivity training in workplaces, schools and public health services. ,Queering the Census also means queering the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey (ACS). Because it asks more specific questions about quality of life, the ACS has the potential to produce government-recognized data on inequalities in LGBT health, health insurance, income, home ownership and employment. These statistics would be useful tools for legislators, LGBT people and the general public in understanding what it means to be a member of a sexual minority in the United States. They would also be critical in measuring the success of possible future laws such as ENDA (Employment Non-Discrimination Act), currently one of the main targets of LGBT rights advocacy. ,The benefits of measuring LGBT inequalities can only result from asking about sexual orientation and gender identity directly, and not from asking about same-sex partnerships. Because the Census counts shared-household same-sex relationships rather than individual LGBT people, it leaves out transgender people altogether and fails to acknowledge the existence of bisexuals. Even for lesbians and gays, these statistics come from a biased sample that excludes singles as well as couples that don’t live together. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students are uniquely invisible because they are less likely to live with their partners, and those that do may be recipients of a special student Census form that doesn’t include the question on relationships.,While the Census Bureau gives only two options for “sex,” it encourages everyone, including transgender people, to check the box for the sex/gender they feel they are, not the one that may appear on other legal documents or was assigned to them at birth. This is fine for trans people who identify as male or female, but those who don’t are left with no appropriate choice on the Census form. Whether or not they reject the gender binary, all trans people are left without a way to specifically record their transgender identity, even though they are often the victims of the same types of discrimination and inequality that other Census data are used to assess. ,One of our friends was concerned that the fluidity and diversity of gender and sexual identity may be lost when trying to fit one’s experience into a checkbox. But queering the Census isn’t about putting one’s true self into words. Rather, it’s about rendering visible classes of people that too often are invisible or marginalized in everyday life. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and trans people all stand to gain from Census visibility.,Queering “Queer the Census”,We think it is reasonable and necessary to push for even more inclusive revisions than simply the addition of a question like the one on the sticker (minus “a straight ally” which, as Task Force representatives explain, is only there for straight people to signal their support). Task Force representatives encourage everyone to write-in their own sexual identity for the sticker campaign, but we think a write-in option needs to be included on the Census form itself. Furthermore, “straight or heterosexual” specifically should appear as options, so that heterosexuality is not the assumed default category. “Asexual” should also be a listed choice.,In addition, we believe that transgender identity should not be a part of the same question as sexual orientation. Instead, the “sex” question itself should be amended to accommodate transgender people, recognizing that “male” and “female” are not unproblematic categories. Although trans people face similar types of legal discrimination as lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, gender identity is distinct from—and should not be confused with—sexual orientation.,The race and Hispanic origin questions for the 2010 Census have 20 checkboxes and 4 write-in fields—inclusiveness isn’t unprecedented. The above reforms would also benefit from being paired with a revised way of administering the Census, to guarantee the privacy of all respondents from their own families and housemates. While it is increasingly common to be “out,” bigotry has not disappeared.,Visibility and LGBT Rights,Last Thursday, March 18, ten people were arrested and fined for staging sit-ins at the Washington and San Francisco offices of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Their demand: that a House vote on the Employee Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) be held this month. Getting ENDA passed is a priority for the LGBT rights movement, because it is still legal in 29 states to fire someone because of their sexual orientation and in 38 states (including New Jersey) based on gender identity or expression.,Queering the Census has the potential to shape advocacy and policy for years to come and, like ENDA, is critical in the push for equality and the freedom from discrimination that every American is entitled to. ,So please put the sticker on your Census envelope—not on the form—to show your support for LGBT visibility. If you are interested in taking further action, please stop by the Queer the Census table at Frist next week for information on how to contact your Congressional representatives directly. We will have form letters and phone numbers ready. If you can’t make it to Frist, or have any further questions, don’t hesitate to contact us at jmuenzel@ or brendaj@.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/three-cheers-queering-census/,"

"A little after eight o’clock on Friday night, I received my ticket for the Spring Dance Festival and fought my way through the throng of latecomers into the last available seat, slyly offered up by the crabby woman at the front desk. The Berlind Theater was packed throughout the weekend, which was, as far as I gather, unusual and likely due to the larger troupe of dancers performing in this recital. Upper-level dance students from the fall joined those working with the five guest choreographers in the varied, entertaining showcase.,This year’s festival demonstrated a dramatic break from the standard modern and post-modern repertoire of the dance department through its incorporation of ballet fusion compositions. Susan Jaffe, the former principal ballerina of the American Ballet Theater, choreographed the premier number of the evening, _Pulse_. Her twenty-year reign at the ABT, as well as her worldly sophistication—she (almost) literally danced across Europe, you know—shone clearly through the four movements. The dancers performed on point, and with explosive vibrancy. The tinny start-and-stop action cadence of Donald Knaack was deftly complimented by the flexibility and grace of the dancers. Working with the Madonna of the ballet world was thrilling for those who know her work, and the other four guest choreographers of the festival were no less impressive.,One such choreographer is Twyla Tharp, known for her incorporation of pop, jazz, and classical music into a new style, named cross-over ballet. She arranged one of her classic numbers, _The Fugue_, in 1970, and now, a full forty years later, helped to restage the piece for eleven Princeton dancers. This was the only number during which I longed for resolution. At some point I must have accepted my fate, that each time the dancers marched offstage another more fully recuperated batch would replace them. One of these professionally outfitted dancers would inevitably count or pat the beat aloud, reestablishing theseries of eruptive movements that carried the piece. The twenty-count theme was the central leitmotif, and if there were pleasure to be found in _The Fugue_, it was in tracking the series of spasms across the stage. Each dancer followed the series in one way or another, performing it backwards, forwards, and, at times, all jumbled up. Each dancer also had to learn everyone else’s part, which, along with the dress pants, likely impacted their opinion of the dance (for the worse, I imagine).,_The Fugue_ was impressively long, and impressively loud given that there was no musical accompaniment. The program explained that “the original, female cast presented one woman as bass, one as alto and another as soprano, in choreographic tone,” meaning that the individualized stomping onstage provided the sole source of musicality in the piece. In later productions of Tharp’s seminal composition, all performers were male, which altered the composition’s tenor. Princeton’s version was co-ed, which, to follow this reasoning, likely produced the greatest possible range of tones onstage. The piece was slightly cerebral, but interesting enough, especially in that the tone established by the dancers’ dress—slacks and a business shirt—and demeanor seemed competitive and slightly impartial. This is either an intentional directive of the choreographer (which subject was humorously addressed in Hannah Rich’s _That’s Just Not It_), or the result of the thorny process of memorizing the disconnected movements so common in the Tharpian oeuvre.,Mark Morris’s _Polka_ displays physical comedy at its best. Morris has a long history in folk and ballet dance, and has collaborated with such notables as Mikhail Baryshnikov, a luminary of the ballet world, and Yo-Yo Ma. The polka’s whirlwind cycle of clapping, slapping, and scurrying in circles premiered in 1992 at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom and was performed in the festival by twelve dance students. A fellow observer claimed that she spent half the piece trying to determine whether the frilly upper garment would be considered a dress or a shirt. It was not until she made her decision (a shirt) that she noticed the two males sporting them among the crowd of dancers. Just like the much-loved polka of every wedding and bat mitzvah ever (i.e. the Chicken Dance), the building intensity adds a flair of hysteria, one resolved in this case by a discordant last note and a sheepish bow. _Night Blooms_, choreographed by the student dancers and Rebecca Lazier, was like watching Fantasia’s “Pastoral Symphony,” by which I mean it seemed like the most fun conceivable. The mismatched cabaret garb and whimsical desires of the cast, as well as the floating lanterns that opened the piece, created an ambiance of playful celebration and sexual mischief.,Student choreography ranged from the alternately turbulent and graceful _Fáh Mái/New Sky_ and the decidedly charming and eccentric _Habit_ by Eva-Marie Walsh and Sarah Simon, respectively. In _House_ two lovers—Jeff Kuperman and Ariel Trilling—exchange seemingly comfort- ing physical contact—an arm around the shoulder—that becomes a manipulative struggle for control, while Yael Nachajon loses an epic battle with a stool. _That’s Just Not It_ performs a fantastic reversal as the dancer receives instruction in front of the drawn curtain, only to turn away from the audience when it’s finally opened, pushing us backstage as she emerges to perform her newly perfected composition.,My overall impression after the show was one of muted awe. That we have talented dancers on this campus is no surprise, but the artistry of the compositions was novel, as were the ambiguities in tone. Often in dance performances, I am told what to feel through overt displays of sentimentality, sexuality, or some other concept noun ending in -ality. Certain compositions in this show left me with questions of what it all means, what purposes these pieces, free of real-world applicability, are to serve—_l’ art pour l’ art_? The Spring Dance Festival was a smarter, more challenging show than many other student productions in that its intrigue hinges on these nuances in tone. The show was a pleasure, to be sure, and is one I plan to attend at the end of this semester.,Just one word of advice for the choreographers next time: don’t _Fugue_ it up.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/attacks-and-coordinations/,"

"I haven’t been young in a very long time, at least in the sort of way Max is in Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are. That book, which sits on my bookshelf at home with a tattered cover and a note from the author to my six-year-old self: Dear Zack: I’ll eat you up I love you so, was the sole entertainment of so many of my childhood nights and days that I cannot really think of my youth without it. In it, Max is brash and resourceful and crazy and lonely and funny and sad and brave, all in a story of ten or so sentences. He goes from his bedroom to an island of wild things, monsters with terrible roars and terrible teeth and terrible eyes and terrible claws. And they really were so. They weren’t colored an inane blue and they weren’t declawed—they looked like exotic beasts one might find wandering about the woods in some fantastical, far-off place. Reading that book then, as a child, was like staring them in the face and taking command, as Max does when he becomes king. There was a bit of madness in the very act of reading such a story, the story of a little boy who plays with monsters. And how I revered that story. Every once in a while as I grew older I would pull it off the shelf and read it again, and I would once again become intimate with my youth, with a time when I stared monsters in their eyes and didn’t blink once, perhaps because I was naïve and didn’t know rightly what else I was supposed to do. So it was with mixed emotions that I first heard of Spike Jonze’s film adaptation of the book. I didn’t doubt his talent, certainly, and I didn’t doubt the merits of the project. What I feared was what it would bring out of me, or rather what it wouldn’t. Because the whole time I believed the film would be successful, certainly in its own way, but I worried that it wouldn’t do the same thing that the book did for me—make me remember what it was to feel like a child, completely unbelieving all the new images flashing before my eyes but diving in just the same, fearing and understanding very little: a completely clean canvas.,I saw the film the Thursday of Princeton Halloween. The film had been out for over a week by then, and I had read the reviews, some glowing and some less than enthused. I had watched both trailers several times, scouring the Internet for the acoustic version of Arcade Fire’s “Wake Up” used in them to no avail. I read every article on the film’s production and took in every still. The monsters look just right, I said to myself. Even Max looked just right, even though he was clearly older than he was in the book. So I took the bus down to some no-name mall in some no-name town to watch it, believing it would be good, but hoping it would be something more.,The film opens with no wild things at all, save Max. He’s in his wolf suit and running around the house whooping and hollering. Then he’s building an igloo in his front yard sans wolf suit, and we are reminded right away that Jonze had quite a bit of adding to do to make ten lines last ninety minutes. It is established early on that our Max is lonely. His parents are divorced and his sister is about as cold as the snowy day he runs out into. He tries to play with her and her friends by provoking them into a snowball fight, but it ends horribly when one of them dives on top of his igloo with him inside, drenching him and sending him into hysterics. He retaliates by destroying her bed, then recreating a fort in his own room.,The film is beautifully shot, all the way through. There is something about it that recalls the way a child sees things: slightly different, slightly rosy. Sure, it’s sad and bleak at times, but it’s not a hopeless sadness. There are ways out of everything, ways to rekindle relationships, ways to remake broken-down igloos that seem to escape us as we grow up. Jonze makes sure the tragedies don’t last forever. His film is accompanied by a rather whimsical and generally wonderful soundtrack composed and performed by Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ lead singer and Jonze’s former girlfriend Karen O, and it, too, has just the right amount of menace and joy. ,But before that score can really rear up, and before the wild things even appear, the film has its most gorgeous scene. It doesn’t occur in the awesome city the wild things and Max build, and it doesn’t occur on the beaches or in the woods or across the sands of this land far away, but in Max’s own house, where he narrates a story to his mother while she works. Max probably thinks she is typing away and hardly listening as he tells of a vampire ostracized because his teeth fall out, but in fact she is transcribing it on her laptop. This scene is one of astonishing intimacy and is framed beautifully by the director. This and the other scenes at Max’s home tell us all we could ever need to know about Max and his life. He feels a little lost, a little detached, and a lot lonely, and he responds by trying to start a rumpus and getting everyone to join in—to lose themselves for a little bit and just be wild. His sister and his mother and his mother’s boyfriend can’t seem to give him that. ,And so he runs off, like we all do at some point, away from definition and safety and certainty into the big unknown world. And he comes upon a boat that seems to sail itself across choppy waters through night and day, and one can only wonder how much time passes as he goes. And then, just like that, he’s on the shore and running towards a mysterious bunch of noises and lights. And there we see the wild things for the first time, masters of destruction, roaring and burning and wreaking havoc. And we don’t really know why they are so angry, just like it’s hard to place what makes Max so aimless in the first place. But it all harkens back to the way we were when we were kids, when things made us cry for no reason at all except that they struck something within us and the response just seemed natural. The wild things turn out to be just as aimless as Max, just as confused. And while they may be the manifestations of his unpredictable character, they are also representations of the people he’s left behind. In Carol and KW’s most doting moments, they recall quite easily his mother and her sympathetic eyes. In their anger and rage we see her calling Max crazy and wishing him to change. In a desolate, sandy landscape we wonder at what was lost, what used to be. In the mayhem that ensues on the island, there is more than one truly baffling moments of film making. A detour to retrieve a pair of owls seemed so nonsensical it made me cringe.,But the film works because of how it all feels. This is not a film about redemption, but one about recalling. The filmmaker isn’t seven anymore, and Sendak wasn’t when he wrote the book. But they kept kindling the sort of feeling that could create this sort of art because they felt it mattered. When Max comes home at last for dinner, I felt myself feeling as I did at the end of that picture book the first time, now so many years ago. I’m going to miss the wild things, I thought. They were lots of fun. But they also made no sense, and were sad and scary and had terrible claws and terrible teeth and lived awfully far away. But when we’re young we don’t think about these things, we just go, and for ninety minutes, watching Jonze work wonders on the screen, I didn’t look at my watch or worry about missing out on campus merriment. I thought about my mom and my dad and places with funny names that are only as real as the images I make up in my mind and dancing in the woods with fire all around. How crazy it all is. And how utterly perfect.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/where-wild-things-still-are/,"

"Slavoj Žižek seems like he is on the brink of a nervous breakdown when he lectures. He waves his arms wildly. He pulls at the front of his unassuming gray T-shirt. He grabs at the hair on his forehead. He even scratches at the sides of his thickly bearded face. Žižek’s anxious mannerisms give his presentations a palpable sense of urgency: it is clear that he feels the need to be understood, as well as a sense of danger; he seems to be fighting to get his ideas across. His ultimate success or failure in this endeavor becomes the drama of his presentation.,To convey his earnestly expressed thoughts, Žižek relies on a curious didactic method. He makes references to high-brow Continental theory—his background is in Lacan and Marx—but just as easily drops in a joke or a reference to popular culture. He will begin to prove a point with a reference to Derrida, follow it with a joke about Moldavians, and then conclude with a critique of _The Sound of Music_, which he has made the subject of substantial analysis. No reference is too pretentious, too scandalous, or even, it seems, too inane for Žižek. At the reception following his recent lecture on campus he analyzed his son’s video gaming habits to make points about human nature, while drawing on his unseemly, encyclopedic knowledge of dirty stories to gossip about members of the Frankfurt School.,The intense Slovenian’s lecture in McCosh 50 last Tuesday was exemplary of Žižek’s presentational style, but was not as aptly suited to the Princeton environment as it could have been. His dirty stories were on display, as were his frantic gesticulations. But the sense of place Žižek’s work often has seemed to be missing. Žižek usually seems to fit his message to his environment or his environment to his message. In the documentary _Examined Life_, Žižek discusses ecology in a junkyard. In his film _The Pervert’s Guide to Cinema_, he talks about his understanding of movies at Bodega Bay, where Hitchcock’s _The Birds_ was filmed. More applicably, he has presented his atheistic take on Christianity at theological conferences. Žižek’s decision to present on that very theme in his lecture on campus, titled “Why Only an Atheist Can Be A True Christian,” seems curious, especially considering that much of Žižek’s other work applies to the relatively secular modern university environment in a much more pointed manner. ,Namely, Žižek is known for his fierce criticism of liberal multiculturalism and pluralism. He challenges these cherished principles of the modern academy from the left, condemning them as fraudulent and misguided. A presentation by Žižek on these themes would likely have made broader waves on campus. His wandering style led him to address these issues indirectly, but his real focus was, for better or for worse, a rereading of Christianity. Žižek began his talk with an extensive analysis of the ways in which religion functions and concluded with a new interpretation of the Gospel in which Christ affirms a secular view of the world through his death on the cross.,Žižek’s treatment of Christianity seems to function better as a series of individual analyses rather than as a complete argument. The first major point made in his lecture was a refutation of the maxim, “If there is no God, then everything is permitted.” In classic form, Žižek turned this idea on his head: if there is no God, nothing is allowed. Atheist liberal hedonism, he argued, leads to the creation of endless rules of self-control that circumscribe the pursuit of pleasure. The fear of violating the rights of others or other ethical standards becomes paralyzing. On a campus where strict dietary codes such as vegetarianism and veganism propagate amongst secular rationalists and people who defend radical sexual freedom often have conservative sex lives, Žižek’s argument seems to ring true.,The real Carnival, Žižek argued, is not the celebration of liberal freedom, which leads to self-restraint, but rather the freedom brought by absolute certainty in one’s cause. Žižek cited an encounter he had with Serbian nationalists to support his point. The nationalists said that they were joining their traditionalist, conservative movement out of a desire for freedom—freedom that was denied in the modern world, which frowns on the wife-beating, rape, and killing which were justified by the nationalist cause.,For Žižek, religion operates in the same way—it can become a means for promoting transgression. Under the strictures of religion, the believer is compelled to rebel, to break the rules. These violations of principle become, in Žižek’s analysis, _necessary_ for true belief. Religion, rather than secularism, becomes the facilitator of true hedonism. Žižek is deep enough into his lecture at this point that a _Sound of Music_ reference seemed called for. He launched into an analysis of the scene where the Mother Abbess consoles Maria with the song “Climb Every Mountain,” concluding that the song is an exhortation for the conflicted lead to go back to the Baron and make passionate love to him. Fittingly, in Žižek’s eyes, a powerful symbol of religious chastity drives Maria to indulge her lust. ,Following his _Sound of Music_ reference, Žižek’s talk was about as fun as a public lecture can be—his audience laughed frequently throughout, and intensely at this point. The laughter he evoked, however, was not altogether an affirmation of agreement with Žižek; it represented a nuanced response to his thought. On some level, it is a criticism of Žižek that so much of what he says comes across as so outlandish and inherently comical. His jokes evoked laughter, but so did points of analysis that his arguments depended upon.,Almost as soon as Žižek came to rest on a particular analysis of religion, he leapt to another. Listening to a recording of his lecture after the fact, his train of thought becomes even more difficult to follow than it was in person. When first listening to him present, it is easy to assume that each new point will be neatly linked back to previous thoughts, but upon second listening it becomes clear that many never are—a frustrating realization. With little explanation, Žižek moved to a discussion of the role of the Lacanian Big Other in religion. He described the Big Other by analogy, comparing it to the official reality enforced in the Soviet Union. That official reality, he said, was not something that everyone actually believed. On the contrary, everyone knew that it was false, but the Big Other was still able to provide comfort. He noted that a half-dozen or so Communist party officials suffered breakdowns, even heart attacks, during Nikita Khrushchev’s “Secret Speech,” not because its revelations about the horrors of Stalinism were inherently shocking to them, but because those truths had never been expressed as official reality. He made the interesting distinction between belief and practice: not the simplistic distinction that sometimes people act like they believe even when they do not, but the more nuanced position that people do not necessarily even know the degree to which they believe in what they appear to disregard or disbelieve in what they publically espouse.,One of Žižek’s signature characteristics is a willingness to criticize everyone, even to the point of contradiction, and this lecture was no exception. After analyzing believers for the better part of an hour, Žižek continued his analysis of unconscious belief by suggesting that atheists hold onto some vestiges of faith even when they think they have completely left it behind—an idea very much akin to Nietzsche’s conception of the “Shadows of God,” which haunt our society in the aftermath of God’s death. At the same time, though, Žižek also suggested that no believer actually believes; that religious institutions become a means by which people find someone else to believe _for_ them. Here Žižek’s willingness to engage in contradiction emerges. Are all atheists really believers? Or are all believers really atheists? Both cannot be true and yet Žižek advanced both theses.,After having covered an enormous amount of ground, Žižek reached the end of his lecture without being much nearer to proving his starting thesis. He swiftly returned to the explicit topic of his lecture and offered a new reading of Christianity, arguing that the death of Christ is like the loss of the Big Other for his followers, that it signals the very real death of God and the death of external meaning. In essence, he offered an existentialist rereading of Christianity: now that Christ is dead, religion must exist only among people condemned to freedom. This was, perhaps, the most underwhelming part of his lecture—it was neither particularly original nor relevant to his other work.,The conclusion of his talk, however, was swiftly followed by the moment that crystallized the absurdity as well as the genius of Žižek. Peter Singer rose to ask his brother philosopher a question. Singer pointed out that Žižek had expressed sympathy for animals in his talk and yet had recently published an article attacking the movement for animal rights, to which Singer had responded. Which position did Slavoj maintain, Singer inquired, the sympathy towards animals put forward in his presentation, or his previous dismissal of the people fighting for animal liberation? Žižek’s answer was roughly 15 minutes in length, covering many of the topics already discussed in his speech. Only at the end did he circle back to animal rights—yes, he said, I sympathize with animals, but no, I do not think you are doing any good trying to help them. If anyone in the audience thought Žižek would be cowed or abashed for being caught in an apparent contradiction by one of the giants of modern philosophy, he was swiftly disappointed. Žižek partly argued his way out of the contradiction, but mostly seemed not to care. Instead, he concluded with a flourish of profound bravado, blending praise with derision and topping it all off with incredible cockiness. Although I am not on your side, you are on my side, he told Singer, and so when I am in power and you are in the gulag, I will make sure you get two bowls of cabbage soup, instead of one. Žižek, the anxious madman, had the last laugh.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/desert-meal/,"

"“The editor of Analecta, the official literary and arts journal of the University of Texas at Austin, was flipping through some old volumes when she came across the writings of former UT student and current filmmaker Wes Anderson. Published in the Analecta in 1989, Anderson’s short story, ‘The Ballad of Reading Milton’, isn’t as good as some of the screenplays he has co-written since but it is certainly full of the quirky charm that has inspired so many people to become fans of his work.” – slashfilm.com,“What are you doing?”,Jason Schwartzman closed the volume of _Paradise Lost_ he had been reading and placed it squarely on the table in front of him. The woman was framed precisely in the doorway of his study, as though placed there by a director with a masterful sense of aesthetics. A cigarette smouldered in the corner of her mouth. Her face showed no clear signs of emotion, and Jason Schwartzman took great care in ensuring that his did the same.,“How did you get in here?” he said.,“Your Indian butler let me in,” she said.,“I will have to fire him,” said Jason. “His Indian son will be devastated.” Jason Schwartzman took off his reading glasses to get a better look at the woman in front of him. She wore a peacoat, and her hair fell over her eyes in such a way as to look both accidental and entirely deliberate. She looked weary, but her weariness made her pretty. As he watched her, she flicked her cigarette onto the bearskin rug and put it out with her foot. Jason Schwartzman’s eyes followed the arc of the cigarette, and as she spoke again, he stared at the burnt patch on his rug.,“I am here to seduce you,” she said. “There is something about your gawky features I find inexplicably irresistible.”,***,Bill Murray stood in front of the tiny motorcycle and regarded it.,“What’s wrong?” said Owen Wilson.,“I can’t ride this,” said Bill Murray, “I’d look ridiculous. This motorcycle is so tiny.”,“Well, I could drive it, and you could ride in the tiny side car,” said Owen Wilson.,Bill Murray shook his head. They stood in the cool fall air, the pale blue sky behind them, the early afternoon lighting just so.,“I know you’re down on your luck, Bill Murray,” said Owen Wilson. “These days, you look desperate and haggard. You drink quite a bit, and you don’t crack jokes like you used to.”,“I have felt like I’ve been playing a very different person than I’m used to,” admitted Bill Murray.,“Riding this tiny motorcycle might be good for you. It could put what you’ve been going through into perspective. Small moments like this can have a cathartic impact, especially when you are in the depths of your despair.” Bill Murray turned to Owen Wilson, a hangdog look on his face.,“Can it play music?”,Owen Wilson didn’t move his feet, but leaned forward and flipped a switch on the tiny motorcycle. A chirping French cover of a Buddy Holly song played through the speakers, and it seemed to surround them, coming from everywhere at once. Together, they stood and stared at the tiny motorcycle for a long while.,“I think you know who you ought to be,” said Owen Wilson finally.,What does that mean, wondered Bill Murray.,***,That afternoon, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson finally found Jason Schwartzman inside of the pantry.  There was a large bandage across his forehead, and his glasses were broken. In contrast with his disheveled state, everything in the pantry was perfectly arranged. Luke Wilson took a moment to wonder why the pantry was full of products which exemplified the muted tones of 1950s packaging, and whether they’d expired. Jason Schwartzman did not rise to meet them, but straightened his tie and smiled ruefully.,“I was seduced,” said Jason Schwartzman, “By Anjelica Huston.”,“How do you spell that?” said Owen Wilson.,“With a ‘j,’” said Jason Schwartzman. “It is an interesting name. She is an interesting woman. I believe she was using me to have an affair.”,“That would make sense,” said Luke Wilson. “People seem to be having a lot of affairs these days.”,It was true. In fact, unbeknownst to the other two, Luke Wilson was having an affair with a reclusive opera singer who lived in the ornately constructed and lavishly decorated mansion which, as a boy, he had walked past on his way to and from school. Luke Wilson also knew that Owen Wilson was having an affair with Bill Murray’s wife, a chain smoker and sculptor who spoke no English, but he did not know that Owen Wilson was also having an affair with Bill Murray.,“Where’s Andrew Wilson?” said Jason Schwartzman.,“Who?” said Luke Wilson.,***,Bill Murray pushed his way through the crowd, which seemed to part in front of him. He heard the party guests whispering all around him, holding their high balls and martini glasses, but as he caught Anjelica Huston’s eye, they faded from his attention. He moved forward and opened his mouth to speak, but his words caught in his throat. Anjelica Huston stepped back to reveal another man, wearing a red velvet suit and bow tie, his hair slicked into the best approximation of a comb-over that it could reasonably achieve.,“Who is this?” said Bill Murray.,“Bill Murray, this is Barnabas Honeysuckle,” said Anjelica Huston. “He’s an architect.  He’s just come back from Europe.” Barnabas Honeysuckle smiled and offered a hopeful wave.,“Barnabas Honeysuckle?” said Bill Murray. “Did your parents name you by playing darts? Did you get rejected from a Pynchon novel? You are ridiculous and unrealistic. Get out of here, Barnabas Honeysuckle.” They both watched him leave.,“Anjelica, I love you,” said Bill Murray. “I didn’t know it until today, when I rode a tiny motorcycle. It was as though everything had gone into slow motion, and for the first time I realized what really mattered.”,“I pity you, Bill Murray. I really do,” said Anjelica Huston. “You don’t know what love is, but you wish you did, and you just won’t stop trying.” She flicked her cigarette. It bounced off of Bill Murray’s forehead, but he didn’t flinch. With that, she was gone.,Why do people keep summing up my complex personal problems in pithy platitudes, wondered Bill Murray.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/faking-wes-anderson/,"

      Oct 20, 2010    ",Dan Abromowitz
"Wes Anderson has always been a divisive filmmaker. There are those who revere him and those who think all his films are simultaneously overwrought and underdeveloped. But whatever you may think of him, it is hard to deny that he has style, and that he does what he likes. And most will agree that his successes (_Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums_) were films of both style and substance, portraits of unique collections of characters in slightly odd but still familiar settings that were evocative and affecting. Still just 41 years old, Anderson can expect much more to come in his career. ,Recently a short story from Anderson’s college days at the University of Texas at Austin was released online. Fittingly, the story is presented as photographs of the pages as they appeared in a campus literary magazine called _Analecta_, much like _Tenenbaums_ is presented as chapters of an ongoing saga. Anderson’s cinematic vocabulary is present in the story: he employs quirky ruminations, a sort of dreamy, anachronistic protagonist, vibrant colors and specific references. But, like most writing done at such a young age, the story suffers due to the fact that Anderson is simply no master—he is only just learning how to tell a story. The plot and his protagonist are a sort of mix of Frédéric Moreau, narrator in Flaubert’s _Sentimental Education_, and Holden Caulfield of _Catcher in the Rye_ fame. Interspersed throughout are philosophical asides that firmly place the piece in the category of pompous college-student writing. ,It begins predictably—that is, idiosyncratically. The protagonist, named Max, decides to try to balance an open can of Dr. Pepper on the back of his left hand, which he succeeds in doing for the very precise amount of time of 36 seconds, before losing his concentration and spilling the contents of the can into an air conditioner, short-circuiting it. He then catches sight of a Porsche double-parked outside his window, painted “African lotus blue.” The car, the narrator is careful to note, is not Max’s. ,The story then transitions to another point of view, marked by italics, and we read Max’s interiority, a first-person reflection on Plato and his intersection with modern life. It is the type of passage you would expect from a college student who has just spent a good deal of time reading Plato for a class. Anderson finds himself straining to adapt Plato’s Theory of Forms to such fields as tennis. (Björn Borg is the Form of “baseline groundstroke passing shot tennis,” says Max.) It is quintessential grandiose collegian, and it is not the last time the device will be invoked.,Max then walks through a restaurant kitchen, where he adds half a cup of olive oil to a dish of mushrooms and proceeds to get into an argument with the chef, who wants them to be “crisp” and not “saturated.” This is a criticism one could level at almost all of Anderson’s work to this point, and certainly at this story. His hands are all over, and too many of his thoughts overlap and blot each other out.,The rest of the story continues in a similar fashion. Max is walking around, running into people, and withdrawing from the narrative to air his thoughts on life and living it. There is a bit of Baudelaire’s _flâneur_ in Max, who walks this environment in order to experience it. There is a good deal of cinematic language and imagery. At one point, Anderson suggests “a medium-close shot from the waist up” of Max opening a door would make a viewer believe Max had opened it with his mind. These details, which probably seemed gratuitous to Anderson’s college peers, demonstrate that all the ingredients were already there. Anderson was already on his way to being the filmmaker we can recognize today. ,Perhaps what makes this feel most like a work of Anderson—more so than the aforementioned use of his standard tropes—is the feeling of an omnipotent puppeteer making the whole story work. Max’s thoughts are often so arbitrary and random that it seems the only reason they would ever come to be in his head would be if someone had planted them there for him to ruminate upon. This is a common criticism of Anderson’s cinematic characters, who hardly seem organic. But it is, I think, his greatest strength—the ability to make sympathetic the undeniably odd and zany characters who look in from outside the norm. Max is just this sort of character, and he might even be the seed for Max Fischer, the protagonist of Anderson’s most widely praised film, _Rushmore_.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/making-wes-anderson/,"

"I steal another glance at my phone. Nothing. My attention returns to homework. It’s been getting more difficult to concentrate. I hear a low buzz and my eyes dart back. There’s no change. It was only the leaves in the wind. I’ll just put it in my pocket. Then I can feel if it rings.,Another ten minutes pass and I haven’t finished another paragraph. I must have missed the vibration—that’s happened before. I slide my phone out of my pocket. Still nothing. Were they all in class? Asleep? Could they be at the gym? I can wait no longer. I have an appointment later this afternoon. I pause before grabbing my backpack. I’m briefly tempted to skip the meal, but realize that I can’t be distracted by the afternoon’s appointment. I have no choice.,I’ll be entering the dining hall blind.,I’ve already lived the next twenty minutes more times than I care to admit. Every Princeton student has. It’s a ubiquitous, but unspoken social ritual. Students play this game on campuses across America. The game is dining hall friend-finding.,It begins with a warm-up lap around the dining hall. Casually you observe the room, searching for familiar faces. You enter the servery alone. It’s safe there. Any observers assume that the “friends” he was supposed to “meet” are also getting their food. The food line offers a second chance. If you are lucky, you’ll meet a familiar face. To buy time, you often choose the longest line—regardless of what food it leads to.,Plate full, you begin a second lap around the dining hall. The stakes are higher in this round. No more servery as a safety net—you need to put your plate on a table. In order to allay suspicion, you must appear sociable. You know almost everyone in the dining hall. You’re just trying to decide with whom to sit. This is a delicate deception. You build your facade with waves and “hellos.” You occasionally target distant acquaintances, but often aim greetings at no one at all. There is no margin of error. If a classmate spots the charade, you will surely be the target of hushed snickers.,Now you’re in a waiting game. Simply making laps around the dining hall isn’t an option (the “wandering freshman” is one of the most desperate sights on a college campus). You need to be inconspicuous. You need diversions. You find any excuse to leave the main hall and stall eating. The “missing spoon” is a time-tested favorite. Curiously, only spoons at the farthest end of the servery will do. Other ploys: “more ketchup,” “accidently got Diet,” and “emergency cup of coffee.”,There is one fail-safe. Princetonians may be social, but they’re also studious. A solitary, diligent diner can be a perfect cover. This route takes careful planning, however. There is a fine line between busy and antisocial. A mere book won’t do. Nobody goes to a noisy dining hall to read. You need a laptop. A multi-tasker is hardly an oddity—there’s one or two at every meal. And they’re believable. A writer madly keeping his train of thought through a meal? A student frantically typing up an email for a deadline? I’ve seen both before. Some may even have been real. Despite its value, the mealtime study is a last resort. The laptop is a double-edged sword. It may justify one’s solitude, but it also deters any possible seatmates. It’s an admission of defeat, something a Princetonian does not handle well.,“Have a good day.”,I snap out of my daze. A woman is smiling at me. It takes a moment for me to recognize the pleasant lady who swipes our cards at lunch.,“Thank you,” I respond, still a little disoriented.,I continue into the dining hall. The scene is all too familiar. My eyes trace the path for my first, casual lap. I don’t even bother to look for a friendly face. ,My phone vibrates. I’m shaken form my stupor and cautiously check the screen.,Hey just saw you walk in, we’re in the corner.,Relief washes over me. I’ve never read such beautiful words.,I walk into the classroom. Besides the eager community auditor in the corner, it’s entirely empty. I had awoken early with one thing in mind. There are only a handful of power outlets in this classroom. Of these outlets, only one is front and center – the optimum learning zone.,I want that power outlet.,It’s a matter of necessity. My laptop, like so many Apple products, has become temperamental in its second year. I can’t trust the battery to last more than three hours. I have a long day ahead of me. I need that outlet. I pitch camp at the electrical oasis. The outlet nurtures my laptop as I open notes from the previous lecture. I slip into a pleasant daydream. Sometimes life’s smallest victories are the sweetest.,Then the door opens.,I don’t need to glance from the screen. I’ve already caught the whiff of another stag. I return to my work. This is nothing to worry about—I’d left my backpack occupying the other seat. I check my Google Calendar. There will be a lot of work this week. But for this moment, I’m content. Yet something isn’t right. I have a nagging feeling that I’m forgetting something. Did I have my wallet? Yes. Had I checked my email that morning? Of course.,Then horror hits me. I catch my backpack in the corner of my eye. On the ground. I had failed to mark my territory. A rookie mistake. I motion to put my backpack on the neighboring seat, but my adversary has already caught my error. He makes a beeline for the opening. Filling the seat now would be rude. Even in the most vicious competition, I can’t break social decorum. That’s what makes me different from him.  My rival takes the seat next to me. My messiness has cost me a clean victory. Now it’s a war of attrition.,At this point, I owe the audience an explanation. It’s not sharing the outlet that’s the problem. There’s plenty of power for the two of us. We’re alone in this room. And there’s another outlet a few yards away. True, the center outlet is the most valuable real estate. But I earned it. I came here first.,Now another alpha male comes and squats at my outlet. Out of several dozen other seats, he chooses the seat next to my outlet. And I don’t even know the guy. Strangers don’t sit next to each other. Not in empty movie theaters, not in empty busses, not in empty classrooms. Not when there are other options. It’s just weird. It’s a denial of all the progress humanity has made. Did our forefathers build these spacious wonders so we could huddle like cavemen in a storm? I think not.,But it’s more than that. I have friends in this class. Where are they supposed to sit? This is their class too, but now they’ll need to choose between my company and a power outlet. I was looking out for my own. I was saving room for my pack at the best watering hole. I’m being selfless, really.,And what if my friends misunderstand? What if they think this jerk is my friend? My comrades will feel alienated, if not betrayed. But there’s not much I can do. It’s a contest of endurance. The unease will eventually force one of us out.,Through the window, I see students approaching the building. If I don’t act quickly, all the outlets will be taken. My friends will need their outlet. I need to claim new territory, while it still exists.,But this isn’t giving in. This isn’t a loss. It’s a more nuanced kind of victory. It’s a victory the beast next to me can’t understand. I make the painful decision. I walk away the bigger man.,Sometimes, a schedule lines up perfectly. Lectures start late in the morning. Classes lump together in two-hour periods. Labs are few and far between. Precepts casually dot the afternoons.  In these ideal schedules, a student can expect some nice breaks. From ten-minute rests to the two-hour spans. Some students can even organize a free afternoon. These breaks are beautiful. But these aren’t the breaks I’m talking about.,I’m talking about the one-hour passing period. ,One hour isn’t enough time to do much of anything. But it’s too long to justify doing nothing. Many students can’t return to their beds to nap. The round trip to the dorms can swallow half an hour alone. Going to the library can be even more unrealistic. During peak study-hours, hunting down a quiet nook can be a lengthy task.,The weight of this crisis rests squarely on the nucleus of day-to-day life: Frist Campus Center. On any given weekday, bystanders may observe the Hoover-town set up in its halls. They will see the city set up in front of Café Viv, and the suburb next to Witherspoon’s. They will pass the colony founded around the C-Store, perpetually hypnotized by the latest ESPN coverage. They may even journey through the freshman ghetto in the Gallery, waiting for the next late meal.,None of these students stay at their camps for long. They pitch tent and work—or perhaps nap—for that free hour. They don’t get much work done, but the session hopefully puts a dent in their weekly tasks.,Few students need to stake their own territory. Even most freshman can find a familiar face. Most people settle at a friend’s camp, taking the spot as their own when the original owner leaves. But the student won’t be alone for long. Another classmate will soon take the vacant seat. The result is the perpetual hive of marginally-efficient workers. It’s a weak imitation of a library’s industrial efficiency. But it’s still more rigorous than a dormitory common room. Caught in the middle of work and relaxation, Frist is Princeton University’s limbo. ,And it’s all thanks to that dreaded one-hour passing period.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/rawk-awk/,"

"Baltimore’s Red Emma’s coffeehouse proves that communism works.  Okay, it’s not a country, and it’s not got much to lose (except a buck), but no one who works there seems to mind. There are no power struggles, unless you count the baristas bickering over who gets to make a customer’s iced latte. Emma’s propaganda boasts “democracy behind the counter,” and since all of the workers co-own the shop, that works too. Though, who cares really? Their “Grounds for Rebellion” make a damn good mocha, and that makes for a well-oiled machine. And by oiled, I mean patronized.,It takes my best friend Anna and me ten minutes and four blocks to find parking on a Sunday in April. Frustrating as it is, I don’t blame Red Emma’s (though it would be nice if they had a parking lot for the People); I blame the arts district. Red Emma’s façade, mounted in block capitals (red, of course) across the exposed basement level of two classically Baltimorean row homes, is one block north of the city’s regional theater, two blocks east of the Baltimore School for the Arts, three blocks from the Walters Art Gallery, and less than a mile from the Maryland Institute College of Art. Whoever said communism is a flawed economic system didn’t take into account the single most important business mantra: location, location. Artists are famed for their activism. Where but Red Emma’s would they get their coffee?,Fair enough, when I was in high school at the School for the Arts, two blocks was too far to get coffee in between classes (and it didn’t help that no one at Red Emma’s seems to be in a hurry), so I ducked into Donna’s, a Baltimore coffee franchise conveniently located a mere one block away. Location. But I yearned to run to Red Emma’s, feeling myself a part of the revolution, fighting against the school district’s rules against off-campus lunch. ,The first time I made it to Red Emma’s was on a field trip to the theater. I departed the mass of my peers and brazenly stepped down the stairs into a darkly lit, heady basement, the brightest lights shining from four old PCs lined against the near wall. I wondered who was using them. (Now I know: whoever wants to.) Without time to browse the handmade signs pinned to the counter for the specials, I asked for a dark roast, made it weak with sugar and milk, and ran to rejoin my party, passing the hundreds of journals, lit mags, rags, and zines that are stacked on tables and in racks, dominating the front of the shop. My absence had gone unnoticed by our chaperon. “You went to Red Emma’s?” a friend whispered, eying my coffee cup. I kept my lips sealed. I was now a part of the revolution.,“Revolution of everyday life,” proclaims Red Emma’s flyer, which I pick up without reading when Anna and I arrive. We are tired, annoyed by the four-block walk from the car through chilly weather we didn’t dress for, and jealous of the owners of bikes locked against the railing right outside the door. We stand awkwardly between bar and tables for the first minute, staring two seats into existence. No seats free, but in that minute we remember where we are. I glance at the flyer and read “community solidarity” before deciding to sit with a stranger at the far table. “C’mon Anna.” ,Anna’s first time at Red Emma’s was only last summer, after her graduation from Baltimore City’s Polytechnic Institute, one of the two most intensive public high schools in the city. She was ready for rebellion. Meeting me after my internship at the Baltimore City Paper, we would stroll to the coffeehouse in summer heat, past my old high school, Donna’s, and the district’s token thrift store, the Zone. Anna refused to order at Red Emma’s that entire summer, intimidated by the casually mismatched and disheveled hipsters, fearing the dreadlocked, grunged-out, all black-wearing punks, and generally recoiling from the men with beards. Perhaps she thought they wouldn’t serve her in her yellow sweater, her orange dress. Her straight and side-parted red hair. We lived on my favorite menu items: iced mochas, Naked fruit smoothies, and Malepesto sandwiches made with fresh mozzarella, tomato, and pesto on a bagel of choice (mine: sundried tomato, half-price if a day-old).,“What do you want?” Anna asks me. I stammer something about an iced mocha and watch in awe as she walks to the bar. She comes back five-minutes later and sets my drink on the table. “I’ll be right over there,” she says, pointing to a newly emptied table where she then places a latte and her computer. She is studying for a government and politics exam. ,Left sitting across from the stranger with nothing to do but stare, I do. I can only assume he is an anarchist, with his books, his computer, his headphones, his green T-shirt with illegible writing and a little cat on the front. I mean, he has a shaved head. He shifts in his seat and my eyes dart to the wide front window, which is halfway up the wall and overlooks the pavement outside. We really are underground. A wrought iron fence is set up at the back of the window, which serves as a display case for communist literature. Oh yes, Red Emma’s is a bookstore too.,There are cardboard signs hanging from the ceiling that point me to various sections of light revolutionary reading:  Anarchism, Activism, Feminism, Labor, Maxism/Communism. They have more neutral sections (Anthropology, Civil Rights, Poetry, Art and Comics), more provocative topics (Prisons, Policing, Politics, Religion, Pakistan and Israel), and local topics like Urban Baltimore. Their flyer claims the “best philosophy section in Baltimore!” pretty unrealistically, since their entire stock takes up only half a room, and the Enoch Pratt Public Library’s main branch is up the road. Red Emma’s most likely does have the best Emma Goldman section in Baltimore. I carefully avoid it, and pretend to know what specifically Emma Goldman did, other than make anarchy (cause anarchy? Be an anarchist? Whatever, I bet Emma wouldn’t want me to obey the rules of grammar); I pretend I belong. But surreptitiously, I Wikipedia her.,Emma Goldman (June 27, 1869 – May 14, 1940) was an anarchist known for her political activism, writing, and speeches. She was lionized as a free-thinking “rebel woman”—,I stop reading almost as soon as I start, resisting the urge to cover my computer screen when a fellow Wi-Fi-er unplugs his computer next to my table. I close my screen slowly, consciously playing it calm, and casually glance around the room. Anna is hunched over her notes, the back of her black sweater giving me the cold shoulder, her red hair hanging in front of her face, so I can’t even catch the attention of her peripheral vision.,Mine is caught, however, by the shuffling of an old and jolly-looking man in a blue jumpsuit who, by the length of his beard and the grey of his hair, may be Santa-in-training, though his frame is more stalk than stuffing. I hear a coin drop on the counter, and a jovial interchange between cashier and skinny Saint Nick; he walks away with a cup of tea and I wonder if communist charity extends to Baltimore’s homeless. “It depends on who’s working, what kind of mood we’re in, and how polite they are about it,” says a beret-wearing and bearded 20-something whose shirt declares, “One Big Union—we want the Earth.” He probably bought it here, where shirts for sale line the walls: the sleekly designed “PANTHER POWER AMERIKKKA” T- has a silkscreen of rapper Tupac (who happened to attend the School for the Arts before moving to California and allegedly getting killed, and whose mother, Afeni, was a Black Panther). On the front of a small, red, muscle shirt, a beauty-marked bombshell outlined in black cries “I said Anarchy, not MANARCHY!” My eyes gloss the signs I once didn’t have time to read: a neon-yellow enticement for “BLENDY FREEZY DRINKS” hangs below the hand-made “UNION MEMBER? You get a 5% discount!!” ,I look down at the flyer I’ve been fingering and notice a new assertion: “If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution.” Then the music that’s been tinkling in the background registers, and I remember: Red Emma’s introduced me, with a Clap of Hands and a “Yeah!” to Alternative music. It gave Anna and me a place to form a friendship that is now stronger than coffee. It gave us a place to grow up and be independent, our own personal revolution. I tap her on the back. We pack our things. We thank Red Emma’s. And leave.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/liberation/,"

"Ever since I realized, a few months ago, that the qualities that make me an anomalous 22-year-old are not mere deficiencies but a product of a legacy, I’ve daydreamed of a time when such a legacy would have still been in currency. The realization was this: what I had once considered a disposition that made me a pocket of air free of both youthful turbulence and highs of youth—which I once described in a job application as my ‘preternatural gift for sanity’—is in fact nothing more than a genetic trait. My father was raised Buddhist, my grandmother was Buddhist. My great-grandparents were Buddhists. How many generations could it have gone on for!?! I was born wearing the yellow of the middle path, the blue of universal compassion, and the red, blessing of practice. My even temperament was not an aberration that made me boring and confrontation-averse, but the product of self-selective breeding, an inter-generational compact to make the blue more blue, the yellow, yellower, the red bleed redredder. So, I’ve since dreamed of a Buddhist dreamland in which my qualities would be illuminated as the highest ideals of masculinity and sociability. No more rewarding the hunky Christian souls who throw themselves left and right in conflict with the world and society! A night nightclub to sip tea in and an action film in which a small-framed Asian boy fixes everything through guile and practice, not force.,The more I dream, the more implausible such a high noon of Nirvanic existence becomes. Not only because the context within which such a realm could have existed is, frankly, unimaginable to my expatriate brain, but also. But more so because my recollections of Buddhists and Buddhism from my childhood are clear enough to prohibit my having a free reign over my imagination. My dad, a cynical evolutionist, belongs to what was once a Buddhist youth group, which is now an old boys’ club. Whenever we went to see, for New Year’s, the plump old man who had created the group (the one-man evangelical who preached colloquial chanting, but could not become a monk because “he liked meat too much”), my dad put on an overly social demeanor that I recognized as his mannerism in front of those he wanted to be kind to but did not agree with (i.e. the in-laws). We laughed together at the vanity of the old man importing a gold plated portrait of a Buddha from India. We ignored the postcards that came, informing us of the next service. I never went to a Buddhist temple, but the ones I saw, being driven through the streets of Seoul, seemed like set pieces—not from another time, but merely as timeless and time-prone as a shanty—about to be crushed by adjoining office towers.,The obfuscation of my own legacy from my awareness was not the result of opacity, but of a uniform, unflattering illumination. I struggle to erase from my daydreams the evidence of such people and such places, but. I must, in order to reflect onto myself a better image. I take out the ugly, neo-traditional clothes favored by some temple goers and the cold, stone floor of the Buddhist youth group’s cement headquarters. The more I imagine, and the more omissions I make, the further I run from what must have been the legacy of beauty in those realms, in their genuine, historical contexts. Nothing like stepping into a candle-lit temple in the early dawn remains. My notions of masculinity and sociability belong to a contemporary Western context and imagination. Even as I understand the nature of my constitution, I still find myself wanting sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll.,Reading is a way to immerse myself in the beauty of those lost realms without being pulled away by my jejune fantasies. Tanizaki Junichiro, in his essay “In Praise of the Shade,” describes how the Japanese home replicates the shadowed dimness of the Noh stage, where lines are softened by the absence of light, darker colors are made attractive, and the folds and wear of well-worn clothes are made natural, the color of red miso made brilliant, and soy sauce is made to gloss. Plates of gold reflect light into the darkened spaces, while the brilliant Noh costumes complement the Japanese complexion, while simultaneously dramatizing the Japanese anatomy, most noticeably the hand. Tanizaki goes onto describe his artistic mission:,“*Even this is a grumble of sorts, and even I know how to be grateful for the changes in the world. So I don’t mean to throw objections at this late hour, when Japan has already set its step to the march of Western Civilization; it even occurs to me that there is no way now but to push aside the elderly and throw ourselves headlong into the changes ahead. We must resolve, however, to bear the loss that we will have to carry forevermore, for as long as the skin tones do not change. What I wanted to note with this essay was the idea that perhaps in some spheres—let’s say the literary arts—we may preserve and make up for these losses. I wish to call forth the fading world of shadows, if only in the realm of literature. Carve deeper its eaves to make more dim its walls, push into darkness that which is too bright and apparent, take down the unnecessary interior ornaments. If only one such house remains, it would suffice. Let’s see what happens when we turn off the electric light.*” – December, 1933,With the same imperative with which I attempt to flee my life through the imagination of the Buddhist dreamland, I try to argue that Tanizaki’s house is no longer standing, so as to not lose myself in lament for the beauty of the house of the shade. Even if Tanizaki succeeded in building it, it is now hidden in impenetrable darkness. A darkness that has consumed the kind of beauty Tanizaki sought to represent, a darkness that consists of Western narratives that teach the East of how friends should be made, how sex should be had, how life should be told. Still, I seek for some incantation to call the house of shades into being, to dispel the unseemly illumination that besets me. I try to break through, to reach in, to dig out, so as to bask in the glow that world would emanate onto my being. This is, even as I understand the truth in Tanizaki’s mission: whatever it was that was beautiful about the world Tanizaki saw passing, one could do no better than to try to preserve it between the covers of a book, in a narrative that might keep it from rotting, sealed away, by words, from the ocular vision that will already have gone after the Western eye.,I find this desire of mine troublesome, if only because it resembles fascist imagery. Cast off the capitalist dirt and cleanse the Japanese Imperial body politic, restore the authentic Japanese spirit. To realize that I could easily have been seduced by the call of the fascists! Could there be some way to express this yearning for restoration without sounding the bugle call of totalitarianism?,I claim to have found just such an act in the case of arson that destroyed the 14th-century Namdaemun (“Great South Gate”) in downtown Seoul. Of course arson can’t be justified, the arsonist should be punished, and a wanton act of destruction ought not to be aestheticized. But follow me.,The arsonist, a 70-year-old Mr.Chae from just outside Seoul, was given the following profile by Hankyoreh, a Korean daily.,_According to the police, Mr. Chae, 70 years-old and married with children, had lived an ordinary life in the bedroom community of Ilsan, outside of Seoul, until his land (approximately 99 square meters) came to be included in a new construction project in 1997…_,*At the time, the company overseeing the construction of a new apartment complex attempted to buy the land for access in and out of a new development. The company had allotted what was then the publicly assessed value of the land, 9.6 million KRW (approximately $70,000 at the time), for the purchase, but Mr. Chae held out for 40 million KRW ($ 300,000).*,*Mr. Chae, enraged, sought avenues of appeal, at the courts, in the city hall, and in the president’s office, but his efforts came to nothing.*,The article goes on to describe Mr. Chae’s first crime against society. In 2006, he went to Chang Kyung Palace, armed with newspaper and a can of butane gas. Using the material at his disposal, he set alight the wooden door of the building Chosun kings had used as their office (in reality, it was only a reproduction of the building the kings had used—the original had been destroyed when the palace was converted into a zoo during the Japanese occupation). He was immediately apprehended by guards and tourists, but the court handed him only a suspended sentence, in view of his old age and his clean criminal record.,The Great South Gate was his second try. Once the southern boundary of the medieval walled city, the gate now sat in the middle of a roundabout, having had its wings clipped during Japanese rule, when the city expanded. It now sits (or, rather, whatever is remaining of it sits), surrounded by office towers, in the middle of busy traffic heading in and out of the city’s heart.,Mr. Chae approached the gate on the evening of February 10, 2008. He later said that the monument had been poorly guarded and that he had no trouble accessing it. The fire quickly consumed the top, wooden half of the gate, while the Fire Department and the Agency for Heritage Preservation dithered, arguing whether or not water should be sprayed. The gate burned through the night, televised across the globe. If arson could be an art, the critics would have raved. “A perfect expression of his deepest inner rage.” The gate burned, illuminated by nothing but its own light—Mr. Chae’s rage was all-consuming. He set fire to his barren clearing of land, as if it would set it free from the encirclement of apartment towers. The gate burned and lit the windows of the office towers with its reflection and its dancing shadows. “It felt as if the glass would melt,” said an observer.,I speak of this act of arson only as a metaphor: it seems to me that the only form the expression of a yearning for the reclamation of a bygone legacy of beauty can take, apart from a fascist call for restoration, is that of self-immolation, self-destruction—that of illuminating the existing material world with whatever light can be made by excising the still-remaining elements of beauty. Still, the burning of the “National Treasure #1” might serve a practical purpose. If some good were to be made of the loss, this act of arson would become a symbol marking the conclusion of an era. An era marked by encounters with fascism and totalitarianism, first in the shape of Japanese annexation and then nationalist drive for industrialization. Perhaps, with now only a reproduction standing, the ever-recurring calls for the restoration of old glory will be harder to sound.,As for me, I think there is no choice but to find humility in the fact that I am far from the first to have sounded an appeal to the beauty of the old. And to resolve to be content with treading the world of dimness, where beauty is obscure, even to the clearest eye, unlike in that place where the beautiful may have been obvious, its illumination unwavering, the house of shades that I hear once stood.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/appraisal-house-fire/,"

"Welcome to Education City: the first knowledge-oriented theme park. Take the path to your left to experience true southern craftiness at Virginia Commonwealth University. But wait a second, if you’re a real Southerner at heart, then you may want to walk a little further to Texas A&M, just down the road. For novelty’s sake, you can take a few courses down south, but if tex-mex is not your style, don’t fret. Walk north a bit to Georgetown, Carnegie Mellon, or even Cornell – life is better in the North anyway. But remember, after foosball and a Texan holler, don’t forget to go to mosque, its only a skip and hop away. Oh, right, did I mention that this theme park is actually a 2,500 miles distant multi-university campus in Doha, the capital of Qatar? Okay, so maybe theme park is a little harsh, I’m sure Texas A&M probably doesn’t serve tex-mex, and I guess the creation of knowledge-based society is probably a beneficial goal. But I wonder if it is a good thing that soon everyone may be a Texas longhorn.,Education City is the flagship project of the Qatar Foundation, a private, chartered, non-profit organization that was founded in 1995 by the Emir of the State of Qatar, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani. And in the ten years since the founding of Education City, great strides have already been made to further their mission: the creation of a community built upon progressive education and innovation, and the cultivation of a group of students who are prepared to meet the challenges of a global culture. The large campus currently hosts about six educational centers specific to Qatar as well as branches of five American Universities, each offering degrees in specialized fields (medicine, business, medias, and not surprisingly the largest field of all: engineering).,The idea is commendably progressive and under the guidance of Sheik Hamad may create a truly global difference. In fact, under His Highness, Qatar became the second country in the Persian Gulf to give women the right to vote (it only happened 10 years ago, but better late then never), and Education City manifests even greater strides for the women of Qatar. Many traditional families are opposed to their daughters traveling overseas to attend university and Education City gives women the opportunity to continue their higher education without having to leave their culture and society behind. Instead, America is brought to them.,The mission statement clearly explains that Education City intends to host the elite research institutions from around the world, so why is it that all the institutions are American? At what point does honest striving for better education become little more than cultural hierarchy? Before you cry “cultural imperialism”, I will remind you that it is the Qatar Foundation that originally did the courting, not the other way around. It was the foundation that asked each of the five American universities (soon to be six with the addition of Northwestern’s Journalism and Communications program) to build branches in Qatar. Each surrogate mimics the respective architecture of their mother university, as well as many of the social aspects of their American schools, complete with dorm life and traditional American activities like bake sales. In fact, even the traditions of specific universities are exported: come pajama day at Carnegie Mellon, the only difference between Qatar and Pittsburgh is that interspersed between the fuzzy slippers and draw-string pants are the dark figures of traditional hijabs.,With no shortage of money, the Qatar Foundation is almost limitless in its possibilities, so why import ready-made universities (unavoidably teeming with cultural implications)? If it is the progressive American style that they desire, nothing is stopping the heads of the foundation from creating new universities based upon the Georgetown blueprint. I am sure that the $750 million that Cornell is receiving over the next 11 years (along with other unspecified “gifts”) could pay for a few good professors even for a new university that (due to age alone) will unavoidably lack the prestige and allure of a Cornell.  But just because something is older, does not mean it is inherently better. In fact, by building their own Universities and creating their own plan, they would be able to attract and cultivate professors with a personal stake in the universities’ futures.,The American universities cannot just export their staff to Qatar on a whim. As a result, many of the classes in Qatar are taught by professors near retirement and visiting professors that only stay for a few months at a time, some lectures are even given by video chats. These situations are less than ideal. But professors at the height of their career lack the motivation to travel to a foreign country, which would effectively put a halt on their tenure track since Education City lacks the facilities for (except for the petroleum engineers) independent research projects. ,But maybe none of this is actually important; maybe it truly is just the name on the diploma that matters. It is assumed that after the students of Education City graduate, they will travel to America to finish their education. But is this the most advantageous plan for a foundation that has the goal of furthering Qatari society? The few students that attend school on scholarship are required to work in Qatar after the completion of the education, but that says nothing of the rest. With the millions of dollars that Qatar is sitting on, why are they looking to create a group of culturally American college students who will leave Qatar in their early twenties, only to potentially discover that their identity as a Georgetown student has permanently rooted them to American soil? But then again, America probably is not the greatest place to work at the moment, so maybe returning home is their best bet. ,For me, the problem does not lie with the education but rather with the culture in which this education is situated. As more American universities are exported to Qatar, aspects of our cultural differences could begin disintegrate. I am not suggesting that American culture is inherently stronger than the traditional culture of Qatar, but as enrollment in these American universities becomes increasingly popular (as of now there are only 300 spots and competition is fierce), grade school education in Qatar (as well as the surrounding areas, as not all the students are native Qataris) will have to shift to a more American method in order to best prepare students for this competition. ,Already at a current college fair in Qatar, hordes of teenagers had to debate the same question that many Americans teens ask themselves each year–questions of extracurricular and SATs, dorm life and social clubs. At this rate, the next question will be: What club do I want to bicker? And I am not so sure I want to live in a world where that is a universal question.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/lawrenceville_of_arabia/,"

"I am a huge fan of public transportation.  I’m a sucker for a good train and trams are pretty cool too. But you know, as funny as I thought public transportation was, it has nothing on private transportation.  And by this, I do not mean real private transportation, but public transportation that, in some underdeveloped countries, has been privatized – in, for example, a place like Nairobi, Kenya.,Public transportation that has been privatized creates a whole new set of issues of standards and organization that I will not even attempt to delve into at the moment, but it also creates a different sort of hilarity that I never thought transportation could have.  In Nairobi they have the large average buses with standardized pricing and rows of seats, but the common mode of transportation is the Matatu (actually, the real common mode of transportation is walking, but that’s less interesting).  For all those who read Obama’s first memoir (Gobama!) where he talks about his heart-wrenching trip to Nairobi, they might already know this.  But for those who didn’t, Matatus are basically just vans.  But like the average road in Nairobi is less a road than a Mario Kart-esque trial of potholes, spiked road belts placed by the police, and all sorts of other obstacles; Matatus are less vans then they are the wishful remnants of what used to be vans.  Think Pimp My Ride, Kenya style, and you have got yourself a Matatu. ,You can tell a Matatu from a mile away, which is good because there is always a chance that one will hit you.  They are tropical-Skittles colored, bright purples and yellows and greens with spray-paint-font words stretched haphazardly across the sides.  The words are almost comprehensive slogans, but someone somewhere seems to have gotten confused, resulting in “What’s ‘Beef?” written on the back of one Matatu, while the words, “EAS COAST DOTCOM REPRESENT” are proudly displayed on the inside of another.  ,Another trademark of Matatus are their sound systems.  The bass thumps in accordance to the pothole bumps and if you’re lucky, you ride will include music videos usually played on two tv’s behind the drivers seat.   ,It was not until Week Two of my internship that I actually rode a Matatu.  Edelle, a girl I worked with, was going the same direction as I was, and was assigned to take me home.  Having a chaperone seemed a bit silly, but it wasn’t until we got to the corner, that I realized how disoriented I was.  There was no line or bus schedule, Matatus whiz as men lean out the opened van doors yelling stops to people on the corners.  I squish into the full Matatu and end up with a seat that is both disconnected from the row, and almost disconnected from the floor.  But the Matatu starts, the fare-taker jumps in, and that’s it.  With every turn my whole chair swung from side-to-side, and just as I realize this, I also realize that the door can’t or won’t close.  Besides the lean body of the man standing in the small space next to the door, I am the closest thing to the door, and I know that as much as the fare-taker is trying to hold the door closed, the next time the van swings right, my chair and I are going left. And no amount of strength is going to keep that door closed.  But the driver decides that he doesn’t feel like going to his usual stops, and so I change Matatus, and resultantly survive.,Matatu Number Two was rather insignificant–it was just a van. But the third of the day was the true Matatu, blacklights and all.  The vinyl seats stuck to your back, but it was barely noticeable through the thumping Zimbabwean-beats and the music video displayed dark toned bodies gyrating on the beach. The blacklight set the tone, perfectly lighting the graffiti stickers on the wall.  I realized then, that I might die on a Matatu, but it would probably be worth it.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/east-com-dotcom-represent/,"

"“In our society, intimacy is strongly equated to sex,” says David Jay, founder of AVEN, creator of asexuality.org, and a self-avowed asexual.  During a lunchtime talk at the LGBT center about asexuality, Jay points out that as kids, we grow up with the understanding that intimacy equals sex and that sex will make us unequivocally happy.  In a sappy romance, the hero’s eyes meet the heroine’s, they share a cute or witty repartee, and all of a sudden we see glimpses of smooth skin, feel our own nervously fluttering pulse, hear crescendoing music that reverberates in our bones and lulls us, crashing wave after violently crashing wave, to our first cinematic climax even as our parents try to protect our virginal, prepubescent eyes. Perfume is sold in delicious shots of exposed necks.  Clothes are sold in ads where nobody wears anything.  As Switchfoot sings in _Easier Than Love_, “sex is currency […] sex is industry […] sex is easier than love, it’s easier than life.”,This is not to say that sex itself is not valuable.  What I am suggesting, rather, is that the hype around it is misguided.  I think that sex can be an incredibly intimate expression of love.  I also think that sex is a pleasurable act and should be enjoyed as such by those who so desire, not covered up as a disgrace.  However, I don’t think that it is inaccurate to say that our current model of talking sex is not working.  The fight for hetero sexual rights has resulted in much needed conversation about sex, but it has also historically promoted heteronormativity.,In his 1990 essay “The Invention of Heterosexuality”, Jonathan Ned Katz, a historian of human sexuality and director of OutHistory.org, writes: “Starting […] as defensive subculture, heterosex soon triumphed as dominant culture,” so that in the 1900s-1930s, “ironically, we find sex-conservatives […] fighting against the depiction not just of sexual perversity [in which homosexuality was then included] but also of the new normal hetero-sexuality.”  According to Katz, Floyd Dell’s _Love in the Machine Age_ was essentially an argument by “a prominent antipuritan of the 1930s using the dire threat of homosexuality as his rationale for greater heterosexual freedom.”,As Jay pointed out during Wednesday’s talk, heteronormativity affects asexuals in much the same way that it affects homosexuals.  In the late Victorian era, mental health experts “defined a new ideal of male-female relationships that included […] an essential, necessary, normal eroticism.”  In 1892, Dr. Krafft-Ebing defined, in his _Psychopathia Sexualis_, the word “hetero-sexual” as “erotic feeling for a different sex” and hypothesized an “inborn ‘sexual instinct’ for relations with the ‘opposite sex’, the inherent ‘purpose’ of which was to foster procreation.”  Not until half a century later would non-procreative and premarital sex enter “within the boundaries of normality,” but as early as the turn of the century, hetero sex was already becoming currency in the emerging consumerist culture.  In the heterosexual fight for reproductive and hedonistic rights, homosexuality and asexuality were left behind.,Ironically, one common misconception of asexuality seems to be that asexuals are sex-conservatives. One of several “Asexual Perspectives” on asexuality.org points out the contrariness of such thinking: by imposing limitations on sex, sexual conservatives actually presuppose that people want to have sex.  According to Jay, asexuals don’t think that sex is “bad” or “evil”, just “boring” or, for some, “gross.”,Some asexuals are, indeed,  “antisexuals,” but Jay describes them as a “splinter” group, with which the general asexual community tends not to agree.  As a general rule, the community does not say that people should not have sex.  Nor do asexuals believe that they are morally superior for not having sex.  They would just like to not have sex, and not to feel like there must be something wrong with them because they don’t want it.  One of AVEN’s recent battles has been for the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders entry on “hypoactive sexual disorder,” which implies by its very existence in a manual of “mental disorders” that you’re fucked up in the head if you don’t want to fuck.,Nor is asexuality the same thing as abstinence.  While abstinence is the conscious choice not to have sex, asexuality is a sexual orientation.  Rather than choosing not to have sex, asexuals simply don’t want to have sex, no more than a lesbian wants to have sex with a man or a very straight man have sex with his very gay friend.  In order to help every shy newbie to feel comfortable, the asexual community maintains the belief that sexuality, like any other aspect of one’s personality, can vary and that such variation is not trivial.  However, Jay adds that most asexuals see asexuality as “something that won’t change, that they’ve felt their entire life.”,I was relieved to hear few such assumptions about asexuals among students’ comments and questions during the talk.  Rather, the questions centered around, well, sex.  “So, what if an asexual has a sexual partner who wants to have sex?” Jay mentions the possibility of open relationships where sexual partners can have sex with others as long as they remain emotionally faithful.  “Yeah, but will they have sex if the sexual partner insists?”  Jay notes that individuals differ, but says that it likely wouldn’t be the same, intimate experience as sex between sexuals because only one is “exposed and vulnerable” while the other is just “going through the motions and trying to figure things out.”  “Do asexuals masturbate?”  Jay notes again that individuals vary, but also cites a survey that found that the proportion of masturbators was about the same as among sexuals. ,Well hold on a sec, David Jay, how can somebody masturbate and not want sex?  Here, Jay makes an important distinction between physical arousal and sexual desire.  According to Jay, most asexuals experience scientific arousal, but don’t desire to actually have sex with another person.  So while masturbating, an asexual might think about the feeling of melting or of sleek tuxedo cats or of nothing at all, but will not fantasize about sex as a partnered experience.,For more on the distinction between arousal and desire: The famous sex scholar Kinsey found in the 1940s and ’50s that 54 percent of men and only 12 percent of women reported being erotically aroused by depictions of nude people. Despite this discrepancy, however, “laboratory studies have shown that women almost invariantly show physical signs of sexual excitement to porn movies,” according to Erick Janssen of “Why People Use Porn” (www.pbs.org/frontline). If you think this means that your girlfriend really does want to watch porn with you and has been lying this whole time, think again: these same physical responses to porn occur even “when [women] experience negative emotions such as disgust or anger” as well (“Why People Use Porn”).,And of course, the question that everybody expects: If asexuals don’t feel sexual attraction to their romantic partners, then how can they distinguish between partners and ‘just friends’?  I can see Jay’s frustration at the difficulty of explaining love without sexual attraction to a group of sexuals used to seeing sex as the penultimate expression of love and the precious pinnacle of intimacy.  An “Asexual Perspective” entitled “Understanding Asexuality from the Outside” asks us to consider an alternate world where a cultural obsession about eyebrows replaces an obsession about sex, concluding that “there are more important things in life.”,My most satisfying answer has been my own incredulity at such a question.  Sure, sex is “great”, “the ultimate”, “da bomb”, but seriously?  What is love if we can’t conceive of its existence without sex?  Isn’t it more than just being friends who fuck?  There is a level of devotion, of caring, of understanding, and of attraction beyond the physical that draws people together regardless of whether they plan to have sex or not.  If we can’t conceive of loving somebody as more than a friend or family member without wanting to fuck them, I think that we are seriously confused.  Risking redundancy, I want to point out another quotation from Switchfoot’s Easier Than Love: “Everyone’s a lost romantic/ since our love became a kissing show.”  Read as such: we no longer understand romance when we confuse love and physical affection.,In a January 4, 2009 “Asexual Perspective” on asexuality.org, an anonymous asexual writes,,“Who should care about asexuality? Everyone who’s ever felt pressured to kiss someone they weren’t attracted to, suffer through a boring blind date, or have sex because everyone else was doing it. Everyone who ever wondered if there was something more than the dating-marriage track, and why we have so few meaningful relationship options. Asexuals are tired of our culture’s constant pressure to be sexual and sexy. We envision a world where people are free to explore their sexuality in their own way and in their own time, whether their libido is at zero or hyperdrive. Why would anyone disagree with that idea of freedom?”,According to a 1994 survey of 18,876 British residents, an estimated 1% of the population has “never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all.”  Assuming that this estimate holds true, then nearly 70 million people worldwide, among them approximately 76 Princeton students (50 undergraduate, 26 graduate), do not experience sexual attraction.,In a society where lust and love are so frequently conflated, a disinterest in sex can be isolating.  “Before Google”, David Jay tells us, “asexuals had no way of finding one another.”  That’s why Jay created asexuality.org in 2001, only a few years after Google went online.  The website serves as a tool for educating visitors about sexuality, but more significantly as a forum where asexuals can connect with other asexuals.,Often times, newbies come to the forums feeling confused or “broken” because they feel like they somehow can’t connect with others.  They feel left out of a society that doesn’t try to understand them.  As each person comes out to the accepting forum community in the “Welcome Lounge,” they are presented with slice after loving slice of cake.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/unaroused-proud/,"

"On Monday, November 22nd at 4:30pm in McCosh 50, Peruvian novelist, critic of authoritarian regimes, and recent winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Mario Vargas Llosa will sit with acclaimed Irish poet Paul Muldoon to discuss Roger Casement, an Irishman well-known for his reports against human rights abuses in Peru. As though Casement’s shared nationality with the former and political convictions with the latter were not good enough reason to bring the two literary superstars together, he is also the subject of Llosa’s most recent novel, _El sueño del Celta_ [_The Dream of the Celt_], and the two are both members of the Lewis Center for the Art’s extraordinarily talented cohort of professors in the Program in Creative Writing.,If you haven’t heard yet, Llosa is a visiting professor (in the Program in Latin American Studies and the Lewis Center for the Arts) who won the Nobel Prize in Literature about a month ago.  Ever since, Llosa has “said [that] he is overwhelmed with interview requests and that his adored daily routine is now in chaos,” the Associated Press reports, “but he insists, ‘I will continue to write and talk.  It is the supreme passion. […] Death will find me with my pen in hand.’” This kind of dedication and enthusiasm for writing is probably why Llosa still comes to class instead of playing hooky and investing his $1.5 million prize in ice cream (apparently an actual offer according to _The New York Times_).,If you’re not thoroughly convinced you that you want to go to the lecture just so that you can glory in the presence of such literary champs, I’d like to share with you something about the subject of the discussion himself. Casement is a fascinating historical figure worthy of the attention of Llosa, Muldoon, and this article. Born in Ireland in 1864, Sir Roger Casement was a British consul in Portuguese East Africa, Congo Free State, and Brazil from 1895-1911. He became famous for his reports on the cruelties of exploitation of native labor by white traders in the Congo and in Peru. Half a century before Llosa’s short political career, Casement fought for much the same cause as did Llosa: human rights, in Llosa’s property rights and in Casement’s indigenous rights.,Later, Casement unfortunately sailed for Ireland in a German submarine in the middle of World War I. For this, he was sentenced to death. Although influential Englishmen tried to secure a reprieve in view of his past services to the British government, they must’ve failed for he was executed for treason in London in 1916 and became one of the principal Irish martyrs in the revolt against British rule in Ireland.,Another interesting tidbit about Casement to bring with you to the lecture is that Casement is likely homosexual, according to some diaries describing homosexual practices that are generally considered to be in Casement’s handwriting.

"“Kids…absorb pornography very differently from the way adults do…. Even young teenagers are generally not sophis- ticated enough consumers to differentiate between fantasy and reality…. They learn what women supposedly look like, how they should act, and what they’re supposed to do.” “Boys who look at pornography excessively become men who connect arousal purely with the physical, losing the ability to become attracted by the particular features of a given partner.” It’s sentences like these, taken from a pdf of Pamela Paul’s presentation at “The Social Costs of Pornography” (a consultation hosted by Robert George at Princeton in December 2008) that make me cringe every so often as I listen to her lecture “How Porn is Anti- Sex” on April 8.,I feel the way that I do when- ever some so-called “expert” talks about me or people like me—here, this demographic refers to 15-24 yr olds who have looked at or chanced upon pornography—and makes generalizations that make my jaw drop and my eyes roll.,I am reminded of the time that I turned on a major television news channel and was greeted by the concerned face of a middle-aged white woman (apparently some sort of “expert”) who explained a group of teenage pregnancies in some small town as part of a national trend in teenage pregnancies deriving from popular culture portrayals of having babies as cool. It wasn’t the fact that she suggested that media might give an incorrect impression of baby-making or her suggestion of national trends that frustrated me. What frustrated me was that she made statements like “kids think…” or “teenage girls believe…” that made me wonder what gave her the right to make such gross assumptions about me and other autonomous human beings like me who fell in this demographic. How could she really think that she knew me?,Since such a vague recollection of old-person propaganda does not make for substantive evidence, take, as another example of unwanted preaching, Jack Thompson, a 60-ish year old “activist” and former attorney who concentrated his legal efforts against the “obscenity” of modern culture and whose name sets gamers’ teeth on edge. I grew up around teenage boys who were gamers. Not one of them tried to rape, shoot, knife, or otherwise harm me, as Mr. Thompson continually suggests is the case.,Pamela Paul uses vocabulary as generalizing as that chanced-upon “expert” and looks fearfully close to being as sensationalist as Thompson. Okay, so maybe pornography is a slippery slope. Maybe looking at porn that plays on the Catholic school-girl, flat-chested, hairless, or cheerleader fetishes do lead naturally to child porn. Maybe porn shouldn’t be used privately, without your partner’s consent, to the point where sex with your partner is no longer desirable, enjoyable, or possible.,If you’re not a fan of pornography, then imagine for a moment that you are a casual user who likes to gratify him- or herself with a little girl on girl action once or twice a week. Now listen to what Pamela Paul says about “casual users”: “[porn] desensitizes them, then [casual use] escalates into more extreme and excessive interest. [...] It’s scary–the casual user was showing the same effects, just to a lesser degree than the addict was.” By equating casual users – probably the part of her audience that she has a chance of swaying – to porn addicts, Paul is not winning any friends.,To make matters worse, Pamela Paul has an unfortunate tendency to come off as heteronormative and gender-normative. Her original research consists primarily of interviews with straight male porn users and their straight female girlfriends. She looks only at heterosexual couples, and she looks only at male porn users. Her interviews with women are all about how they feel about the effects of porn on their partners.,As stereotypical as Paul manages to sound, though, she presents some interest- ing arguments. I walk into the lecture hall believing that pornography, like masturba- tion, is a personal act of pleasure, which would-be sex-politicians have no right to criticize. I walk out seriously questioning my assumptions. Although there are many points on which I don’t agree with Paul, I can understand her concerns about the prevalence and intensity of porn use today.,Paul answers the title question “How Porn is Anti-Sex” by asserting that:,1. “If you’re jerking off to pornography, then no. You’re not having sex.”,2. “If he’s jerking off 10 times a day, then when he comes home he’s too tired to have sex with his wife.”,3. Pornography “isn’t particularly sexy; it’s a commercial product. (But then again, I also prefer homemade muffins to Hostess.)”,Paul also supports her argument that “porn is anti-sex” with recollections of interviews with men who told her how porn affected their sex lives. She says that her interviewees told her that “they had problems maintaining an erection, some found it impossible to ejaculate in [women’s vaginas] or at all, a lot of women said that men had to watch porn at the same time [as having sex], [and] men got images in their head and couldn’t get them out even when they wanted to.” In her earlier lecture, “How Porn Destroys Lives,” she also asserted that porn “changes what men expect from women” and “ruins relationships.”,Paul worries about youths who see porn and, for instance “the girls think they need to be in vulnerable, crying positions” because that’s how women are portrayed in the porn. She says that women who know that their partners have been looking at perfect bodies all day experience “the feeling of being unshaven and wearing granny underpants.” These women question what it is that the porn stars are offering their partners that they can’t. Porn “undermines intimacy because you’re introducing something else, and it doesn’t just go away.”,She also points out that men will say things like “that’s an enjoyable fantasy, but no, that’s not how I want to relate with a woman,” yet the media to which we are exposed stick in our minds, so that when she asks these men if porn “affects the way that you look at women in the workplace”, she says that “if you talk to them for a while, then they admit” that it does.,According to Paul, the old anti-porn stance in the ‘80s centered around the hypothesis that porn encouraged rape. She says that pro-porners now say, “if porn doesn’t cause rape, then there’s nothing to criticize,” but according to her, “well those men are still dealing with women on a daily basis: wives, daughters, etc., even if they’re not raping them.”,Paul insists that she’s never advocated censorship. However, she does support regulation. In her December 2008 lecture, she claims that “If pornography involved blacks or Jews or any other minority or group, I think that liberals would respond with outrage. But it’s women and there’s been no response.” She realizes that “the pro-pornography movement had a very strong argument that appealed to liberals. It was about the First Amendment, civil rights, human rights.” Paul states that “pornography is a kind of media and it’s also a product—and both of those things are regulated.” She believes that porn should also be regulated, in the same way as aspirin, cigarettes, or R-rated movies, instead of occupying the political gray area that it does now.,Paul uses the heyday of cigarette smoking as an analogy for the current popularity of pornography. “Cigarettes were once extolled by doctors and glamorized in the movies … but once people know that cigarette smoking isn’t very good for you, the consumption “Kids…absorb pornography very dif-started to decline. My hope would be that that would happen with pornography.”,I think that most people, porn us- ers included, can agree that porn isn’t particularly good for you, even if some debate whether it is all-that-bad for you. Yes, porn is pleasurable, but that doesn’t make it healthy. Like smoking cigarettes, drinking any more than two drinks in an hour (the most that your liver can handle before starting to feel strain), eating a bag of chips, or having cake for dinner, porn feels good but isn’t good for you. Just like eating cake for dinner, however, I don’t think that it’s going to kill you (or your figure or your libido) either. I personally believe that porn is not the devil that Paul claims it to be, that it is not the origin of all female objectification, or of all sexual perversity.,Still, porn tends to encourage objectification of its subjects. Additionally, among those of us who occasionally blur the lines of reality and fantasy (quite a few, given the existence of Second Life and the hordes of pubescent girls in love with Edward Cullen), porn also encourages a skewed perception of sex itself. Paul’s unfortunate tendency to sound very biased might not bring this point across very convincingly, but being exposed to staged and airbrushed sexual imagery at a young age definitely affects one’s perception of sex.,A friend of mine suggests a solution that I like much better than Paul’s (which sounds more like a series of accusations with no solution): spread sex education. Teach that porn exists, that it isn’t healthy, and that it degrades those within it. At the same time, teach that it’s not evil, that if used it should be used in moderation, and especially that it does not reflect real life (and can easily get confused with it).,Paul gets a lot of flak for her anti-porn stance. Some of the more incredible critiques, she tells us upfront. Claims that she is a prude, hates men, hates sex, and basically wants men to be shackled by their wives (and I don’t mean as in BDSM).,However, a quick glance at other critiques against her book _Pornified_ reveals that these haters are by no means her only critics. Some one-star reviews on amazon. com point out that Paul left out some of the preeminent scholars on sex addiction in her considerations, that her study is hardly scientific by any sociologist or psychologist’s standards, and that she presents a one-sided, biased argument.,To conclude, I’ll share this excerpt from a review in _Slate Magazine_’s Book Club, written by Laura Kipnis:,“Porn may make a convenient scapegoat for everything that’s appalling in the world these days, but new technologies or genres like Internet porn only thrive when they confirm dispositions already inherent in the culture. [...] Paul mistakes a symptom for a cause.”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/porn-anti-sex/,"

"Roman Polanski has lived one of the most fascinating lives of the last century, though it would be hard to call it “good.” Such a title ought to be reserved for more pleasant, straightforward existences that perhaps begin modestly and end with a substantial list of quality works and a likable persona maintained till death. Paul Newman comes to mind, him of the dazzling blue eyes, remarkable performances and charitable donations, born in a suburb in Ohio to a Jew who ran a sporting goods store. Polanski, perhaps due to his European roots, is much harder for us Americans to relate to, even in his early years. He lived in Krakow, and man- aged to escape the Ghetto there, while his mother died at Auschwitz, a story similar to that of the musician Władysław Szpilman, whose autobiography Polanski adapted for his Academy Award-winning _The Pianist_. His life continued its rather tumultuous arc with his marriage to Sharon Tate, who was the victim of one of the most infamous of all crimes, the Manson Family murders in 1969. She was stabbed to death when pregnant with Polanski’s child, while the director was abroad making a film.,Of course, these episodes of immense personal struggle have nearly vanished from the public conscience due to Polanski’s sexual assault conviction in 1977 of a thirteen-year-old girl. He fled the United States to avoid prison after that, and has never returned.,It is hard to believe that he has not set foot on the shores of this nation in over thirty years when watching his most recent film, the sharp, clever, mostly satisfying _The Ghost Writer_, adapted from the British novelist Robert Harris’ _The Ghost_. (Harris also worked on the adaptation.) The film is set almost exclusively on Martha’s Vineyard in wintertime—which of course (unless one believes in the sort of vast conspiracies Polanski’s film finds itself dealing with) is not at all where the film was actually shot. Instead, he used the German North Sea, creating one of the more remarkable settings for a film I have seen in some time. (Amongst those that are real, so Pandora doesn’t count.) The cinematography is credited to Pawel Edelman, who creates lushness and a physically and emotionally dense setting out of drab gray skies, churning slate-colored water and seemingly endless rain. For whatever reason, I found myself reminded of David Carradine’s speech about the mythology of Superman from Quentin Tarantino’s _Kill Bill_. “Superman didn’t become Superman. Superman was born Superman,” he tells us, as the titular Bill. Where Peter Parker must put on a costume to become Spider-man and Bruce Wayne must do the same to become Batman, Superman instead must put on a costume to blend in with the rest of humanity. He chooses to be a docile, largely pathetic man with conservative fashion sense and wire frame glasses, who is meek at work and generally a “coward,” according to Bill. “Clark Kent is Superman’s critique on the whole human race,” he says. Likewise _The Ghost Writer_ is Polanski’s America, seen through the lens of a banished outsider. It is domineering and bleak, but with a sort of romance to it, as though somewhere in the seams of this great, gray-blue cloak spread over the screen there is the possibility of the sun returning. Perhaps this is what Polanski believes about his own relationship with America. But I’m getting sidetracked by conspiracies. Which means I’m not really, because The Ghost Writer is about just those things.,Even more specifically than the faked locality of Martha’s Vineyard, the film takes place in a massive modernist palace on the dunes and overlooking the sea. The thing itself is colored the same as its surroundings, and is a rather handsome and compelling character on its own. I don’t think I would be exaggerating to say that the cinematography, the lighting and the set design are reasons enough to see the film. The house was concocted by production designer Albrecht Konrad, and is a set somewhere in a very large studio. The massive floor-to-ceiling windows and blemish-free concrete walls are housed somewhere far away from any actual beach. Thus, the scenes inside the house feel insular, as though the howling rains outside are a world apart from the one experienced by the characters nestled uneasily within.,But enough of this delay; Polanski’s film is about Tony Blair, it seems, and his strange relationship with the United States. Of course, the film does not acknowledge this so blatantly. The Prime Minister in the film, now out of office and attempting to write his memoirs, is called Adam Lang and played quite compellingly by Pierce Brosnan. Ewan McGregor plays the Ghost, the unnamed writer who is charged with the task of taking the rather daunting manuscript Lang composed with his previous ghost to turn it into something that will sell. (There are several amusing scenes that go over life in the modern publishing world. In fact the film is riddled with humorous sight gags and clever jokes that move it forward without diminishing the tension. One word I would use to describe the thing would be “tight.” It feels finished and complete, which is much more than I can say about many movies today.) Of course there is a bit of menace to the whole escapade, as the writer McGregor is to follow was discovered washed up on the shore a couple of weeks earlier—under, we come to discover, rather mysterious circumstances. One of the subtle (or not-so-subtle, depending on how you see it) gems of the film is a cameo by Eli Wallach of _The Good, The Bad and the Ugly_ fame (he played the Ugly) as a Vineyard lifer who helps McGregor on his quest to uncover some information regarding the death of his predecessor.,All in all, the film moves swiftly, with clean editing, crisp dialogue and beautiful, spiteful scenery. The film is not a thriller in the modern sense. It does not aim to shock with sudden directorial flourishes or special effects outbursts. It is grounded very much in reality, and it is within this realness that we find ourselves quite comfortable, making the twists Polanski offers us both satisfying and believable. There are a couple of moments I hesitated to believe were possible, regarding a bent- on-vengeance military father, and I feel the film could have been much longer, actually, and offered a bit more. But as it stands, the film is highly enjoyable. It shows that for however long Polanski manages to remain free, or even alive as he advances in age, he will continue to make films that showcase his deft touch, and one can at least call that part of his life a success.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/america-afar/,"

So, at the end of Pride and Prejudice (at least, the one with Jennifer Ehle from 1995), the giant bug-alien wearing Edgar D’Onofrio’s skin tries to leave Earth.  Normally Tommy Lee Jones would be there to stop that from happening, but he’s gone inside Bobby Fisher’s stomach in order to get their guns and win the final match of chess against Arnold’s grandfather (Arnold from Hey! Arnold).  Without Tommy Lee Jones there to make his aggressive moves, Colin Firth has to fend for himself.  At first he gets upset and rejects his American daughter, played by Amanda Bynes, because she is not British enough, but then after she does a fashion show and is silly during it, he realizes that family is super important.  Upon realizing this, he figures out that by crushing little bugs that have fallen out of a dumpster nearby the spaceship, he is actually killing family members of the giant bug, who gets upset. The bug decides to not leave Earth immediately but instead try to kill Will Smith—both because he is upset by the bug thing, but also because he doesn’t want Will to move to Bel Air and turn his family’s home into a wacky brothel run by Will and Bill Murray, who smokes two cigarettes at once because life is just that bad.  Meanwhile across town, after witnessing a failed attempt to meet the aliens when the albino religious freak blew up the first crazy space station, Jodi Foster goes into space and sees her father, who died in her very home when she was just a young girl.   And she called the ambulance but he had already died and she was so upset about that that she couldn’t even enjoy sex with Matthew McConaughey, who’s like, “I’m in this movie?  How charming is that!  I must be very lucky and/or hungry, always!”  Then, the alien who is her father tells her that he is actually not her father, just an alien, but she’s still super touched when she sees him.  Then Tommy Lee Jones busts out of the alien/daddy’s stomach by shooting his gun from the inside, and the alien goo gets all over Jenna Jameson and Harvey Keitel, and they both chase down Will Smith and torture him until he confesses that he was dead the whole time, and that’s the end of the movie.,- Wise Wendy,Dear Wise Wendy, ,I’m pregnant.  ,From,,- You Are the Father,Dear mother of my unborn child, ,Wow.

The disciples really were the prototypes for the moron in front of you at the supermarket who takes so long to write a check that you can actually see her hair follicles growing.  But don’t get angry, just think about what Jesus had to put up with every day.,Take the eighth chapter of Mark as recorded in the Medium Rare Nass Extra-Sensitive Annotated Bible, in which Christ feeds the multitudes.,8:1 In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them, 2 “I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat….4 And His disciples answered Him, “Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?” 5 And He was asking them rather smugly, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven.” 6 And He directed the people to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them…7 They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well. 8 And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces. 9 About four thousand were there; and He sent them away. 10 And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples.,11 And they had forgotten to take bread, ,…and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them. 12 And He was giving orders to them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and don’t hit that rock!” 13 They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread. ,14 And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet see or understand? Do you have a hardened heart? 15 “HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR?

"“We have a report of three men running out of the forest and chasing a vehicle, one of whom was wearing a trench coat and a hat.”,That is among my favorite sentences in the English language. Poetry like this rarely stumbled into real everyday life, and when it does, it should be tumbled and slipped into back pockets like a semi-precious stone.,—,The sink and the toothbrush and the shower and the shirt and tie and the minivan and a bowl of cereal inhaled in hurried spoonfuls. This—from the maternal wakeup nudge to the tardy sprint through the doors of my prep school—was my ritual. A decade old, ancient and untold, never to change. At least until I got my license a few months later, at which point everything stayed the same only I couldn’t eat cereal in the car anymore so I usually ate a granola bar.,And the day unwound the way all Friday afternoons reliably unwound. Ties lolled loose around necks and shirttails liberated, we found ourselves sipping cool chocolate milks in the cafeteria. Some shipped off to practice or rehearsal or whatever, but inevitably we were all shuttled back home in our respective minivans. Then came another recurring ritual. Now we would figure out how we were going to enjoy our Friday night; or, more aptly, we would determine whose video game console would be tapped for collective use that evening. That fateful day it happened to be mine.,We knew nothing of trench coats or hats.,The night began as an innocuous one, notable only for how staggeringly average it was. Three chums sitting around a lukewarm box of Domino’s, Coke cans fizzling their way into static: a set piece borrowed from countless sitcoms, life imitating art but only the boring parts.

There was no conceivable plan in mind, but along the way we gathered some random detritus sitting in my garage:,i. A Canon digital camera.,ii. Several pieces of sidewalk chalk.,iii. Three bucket hats.,iv. A neon orange skateboard.,The agenda: carve something worthwhile out of this night’s mediocrity.,The hats were easy enough to figure out. The chalk, too. But not a single one of us knew how to ride the skateboard, and perhaps that was for the better, because this was where the camera came into play. First, one of us would leap into the air and position the skateboard at some glorious improbable trajectory. Using careful timing, a not insignificant amount of luck and quick trigger-fingers, we froze each faked moment on film. With nonexistent skateboarding skill, merely average leaping ability and a passing familiarity with the flash button, we assembled a portfolio, formidable by any real skater’s (read: gullible person’s) standards. A beautiful hoax.,Whenever two people were off a-hoaxing, the other member of the trio would be scrawling out some pseudo-graffiti in the middle of the road. Crayola on asphalt was our oil on canvas, a perfect medium for this midnight magnum opus, though admittedly we had curfews to make and it wasn’t quite midnight. Cartoon faces (real creepy), meaningless phrases (“Evry Bodi Tans A lot” [sic]), an only half-ironic “Anarchy” symbol (O we were young) … all these strange runes etched out in pastels for no one to see.,[I pause the narrative for prolepsis. If all this—the faux-skateboarding and jumping and photographing and graffitiing—seems totally baseless and bizarre to you, you are not alone. Let it be said that I have no idea why any of this was taking place. This was the product of clinical boredom, of shapeless gray routine and ritual. More than anything it was teen rebellion, rated PG.],This was a quiet road but whenever a car approached, we’d grab the skateboard and hop off onto the sidewalk. That is, until a familiar black-and-white car sidled up next to this bunch of law-abiding hoodlums, and there was no hopping anywhere, just honesty. My stomach lurched even though I knew I hadn’t done anything worth punishing. Out came the cop, greeting us cordially, searching our pockets, soliciting our addresses (this was essentially my backyard), smirking at the skateboard. I just went through the motions and didn’t know why. But as I set a piece of chalk down on the hood of a car, explanation arrived by way of police radio buzz:,“We have a report of three men running out of the forest and chasing a vehicle, one of whom was wearing a trench coat and a hat.”,Now. This sentence deserves some parsing. Rarely is life so exquisitely misinterpreted. ,“men” = _perhaps generous for a couple of skinny 16-year-olds_,“running” = _sauntering back onto a road_ , “forest” = _a little copse of trees by the side of the road_,“pursuing a vehicle” = _sauntering back onto a road, maybe in the general direction of a car that had passed by a few seconds earlier_, “trench coat” = *a tan, waist-length jacket*,“hat” = _the hats_,It should be revealed now that the hats were not ordinary hats. These were relics of a baffling third grade phrase when floral bucket hats were all I ever wanted to wear. This spell proved short-lived because my tiny nine-year-old head couldn’t quite fill out the empty space; now, years later, skulls swollen with time and schooling, we wore that floppy Hawaiian print with aplomb.,And the sentence reproduced, in all its glory:,“We have a report of three men running out of the forest and chasing a vehicle, one of whom was wearing a trench coat and a hat.”,I tried to repress the dumb smiles that sprawled across my face while the cop calmly picked up the receiver and responded: “I have three juveniles.”,With the smiles came the realization. Everything we had done tonight had been hugely and hilariously misunderstood. One of the drivers that passed us by must have felt threatened by our imposing 5-foot-something presence, enough to warrant a call to the police in which he or she described us in rather flattering if inaccurate terms. I figured our lively headwear would have blown our cover as rough-‘n’-tumble hooligans.,So the cops were obliged to make an appearance. And given the circumstances—we were three inexplicably happy kids holding sidewalk chalk, wearing flowery hats, holding a shamelessly neon skateboard—it was not unreasonable for the policeman to assume some potent substances were at play. But they weren’t. The only things in our bloodstreams were some vestigial caffeine and the impulse, the aching impulse, to do Something Else. The cop left and left us in a daze, a fog of silent laughter: we all knew something surreal and fundamentally teenage had just happened, but no one was sure quite what, just that it was Something Else. At the very least it was an unforgettable sentence and an odd Facebook album.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/pg-teen-rebellion/,"

"“When you’re famous and say you’re writing a book, people assume that it’s an autobiography—I was born here, raised there, suffered this, loved that, lost it all, got it back, the end. But that’s not what this is. I’ve never been a linear thinker, which is something you can see in my rhymes. They follow the jumpy logic of poetry and emotion, not the straight line of careful prose. My book is like that, too.” —Shawn Carter,The New York Public Library recently hosted a conversation between Shawn Carter—also known as Jay-Z—Princeton Professor Cornel West, and NYPL’s Paul Holdengraber. The topic: Jay-Z’s forthcoming memoir, Decoded.  To be released on November 16th, the book is being promoted as Jay’s reflections on his art and his life and his craft. What follows is one writer’s instantaneous reflections on the dialogue:,7:08 p.m.,Jazz plays loudly in a dimly lit room at the New York Public Library. A screen—either projected or LCD—shows images of Jay-Z’s childhood stomping ground, Brooklyn. On the stage are three chairs, two tables, and one vase of roses. The stage is set. ,7:30 p.m.,They still have not begun. Perhaps a reference to Kanye’s Late Registration, on which Jay-Z rapped and whose cover picture was taken outside McCosh 50—a place Professor West knows all too well. Perhaps? The stage is as it was at 7:08. ,7:36 p.m.,The song Jay sampled on “Can’t Knock the Hustle” bounces through the room. Nut!  Still hasn’t started, but that screen is dark.,7:38 p.m.,NUT! NUT! NUT! Jay’s fittingly autobiographical awesome song “December 4th” comes on but is interrupted by the traditional spiritual, “Let My People Go”—will that be the theme of the evening? Holdengraber comes out and introduces the event, gets the people pumped up! Invites audience to join NYPL mailing list…,7:44 p.m.,Holdengraber (hereafter known as H—I don’t feel good, don’t bother me) introduces Cornel West, reveals he himself is a Princeton alum. West shakes his butt before sitting down—nut! Introduces the book as the greatest of the past decade, Jay-Z as the greatest poet of that same period. Woah. ,7:50 p.m.,H begins by reading a passage, Jay makes the inevitable comment about H’s strong German accent. Cornel giggles. Gets down to business of talking about influences and stuff… H makes the obvious point about his childhood being different from Jay’s.,7:56 p.m.,Oh, the glory days of Princeton! Jay-Z and Toni Morrison talkin’ Socrates! Nut! West makes point of Jay-Z being Plato to Biggie’s Socrates. Hm. He says Jay’s music has value in its context as part of history and black music and its anti-terrorist resistance to the siege of black America… Jay is the scion of that cultural tradition. ,8:03 p.m.,H brings discussion back to book. Compliments Jay’s “almost Talmudic” analysis of his own lyrics; he posits another analogy: Jay the critic is Ezra Pound to Jay the rapper’s T.S. Eliot.  This is heady, beddy stuff. Compliments Jay for expanding his (H’s) vocabulary in the book. ,8:09 p.m.,Jay discusses “Socratic exchange” with Oprah Winfrey about “the N word.” Talks about “ninety-nine problems but a b—h ain’t one” being provocative and not misogynist. That b—h is not a woman but a dog in a drug-sniffing K9 unit—nut! Criticizing critics for criticizing his profanity; he is either being clever, descriptive, or provocative. ,8:14 p.m.,Some Curtis Mayfield blasts over the speakers (he is one of those influences). Professor West grooves hard and sings along to “Pusherman.” He and Jay suggest the drug hustler is the freedom fighter, but with a lower level of maturity. They are young Lech Walesas; they are young George Washingtons! Jay, in his soul, is “hustler first, artist second.” (Me, too, I think.),8:21 p.m.,H asks Jay, “You can be naughty, right?” Pause. Tells Jay, “You create a sense of intimacy for a man such as myself.” ,8:24 p.m.,Professor West makes good point about people criticizing rap’s “barbarism” without recognizing the “barbarism” it responds to. ,8:27 p.m.,Jay posits rap as a linguistic revolution. His influences (Prince, Mayfield, etc.) weren’t speaking his generation’s language, so they created music that did. West: “It was your power, your voice!!!!!” ,8:32 p.m.,Jay gets into “technology and society” and oddly praises internet as not democratizing but purging of bad music from labels; internet, he says, will bring back “old days” of music. He is, as we know from “Encore,” “out the country but the BlackBerry still connect.”  ,8:35 p.m.,H talks about going back to Germany to visit his ailing father, who asks him what rap is. H reads a letter his nine-year-old son in response to that question; “Rap,” he writes, “is what allows dreams to come true.” Talks to Jay about his mythologized notebook he would write thousands of rhymes in. He lost it, apparently. ,8:43 p.m.,Professor West, a religion pastor at Princeton, finally brings up religion. Apparently Biggie’s death shook Jay’s theology.  Jay says he believes in God, but Cornel West presses him on it. Jay says, “I believe the Ku Klux Klan prayed to the same God.” West nods his head. ,8:51 p.m.,H brings up Jay’s appropriation of Annie, but my internet fails. It truly is a hard knock life…,8:53 p.m.,Back up and running! Nut! “It was the best of times, it was the worst times”…Jay plays this to his running theme of emotions transcending external divides. Professor West asks what Jay’s ideal world would look like; Jay says this one. Oh, ever the realist poet! ,9:00 p.m.,This is a very New Jersey-centric discussion. They just played Lauryn Hill; Jay is part owner of the Nets; Professor West teaches at Princeton. ,9:03 p.m.,Jay recounts the rapper Scarface writing a verse for “This Can’t Be Life” about his friend’s son dying, moments after he heard about his passing.  To him, that is the best of rap, that direct emotional question. H hasn’t spoken forever. I miss him. ,9:07 p.m.,Guess who’s back! H starts a discussion about Jay’s parents. They were apparently scared of him (“*ucking scared”), but still supported his musical interests. Jay says rappers appear desensitized because many of their fathers had abandoned them and they are scared of being vulnerable through love to another abandonment. ,9:13 p.m.,Jay-Z: “At my father’s funeral, I was more intrigued than devastated.” ,9:14 p.m.,Nut! “Brooklyn’s Finest”—Jay’s collaboration with Biggie—fills the room. It’s a very violent song, describing a crime, beginning with Scarface gunshots, “shooting your daughter in the calf muscle.” Professor West: “This brother came from the underside of the American Empire, the projects.” He doesn’t discuss that “shooting your daughter in the calf muscle” part. ,9:17 p.m.,We get to Professor West’s favorite topic, Barack Obama. West says Obama should be more like Jay. Jay praises Obama, and for embracing rap despite stigma. Cornel brings Oprah back up (I didn’t catch why) and flips out that she’s never had a “blues man” on her show and then gets into an argument with the audience about whether B. B. King has been on her show. He recedes into contemplation. ,9:25 p.m.,H brings it back home. He references his own naïveté again about rap, says he will bravely ignore the PARENTAL ADVISORY stickers and let his kids listen to Jay.  Jay “reveals” to H that his kids know swear words and might have said them. H is pale. ,9:27 p.m.,H begins a question, “If you were to have a son or a daughter…” Apparently, that was the extent of the question, because he stops—but no one responds.,9:30 p.m.,“Empire State of Mind” plays over the speakers: all three men—the academic and theologian, the rapper, the librarian—all bob in exactly the same way. Afterward, Cornel West: “Empire State of Mind! Empire State of Minddddddd!” Criticizes its imperialism, “but [he] likes it musically…”,9:32 p.m.,West and H say they have been inspired. Event ends abruptly after West refuses to ask a final question. All three men stand about a foot apart on the stage and scratch their heads until H has an epiphany and directs them off the stage. I’m going to get a cookie, so you know.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/imperial-state-mind/,"

"A simple question: is it worth reading _The Daily Princetonian_ to keep up on the ways in which it has embarrassed itself?,A simple answer: probably not. Welcome to PrinceWatch. Welcome to _The Daily Princetonian_ of November 12, 2010.,__Terrace may open doors to graduate students__,by Molly Brean,As one becomes familiar with _The Daily Princetonian_, it becomes clear that the _Princetionian_ never justifies the existence of its own articles. There is the vague suggestion that the subjects of ‘_Prince_’ articles are significant, but rarely is there real evidence. This can lead readers to peruse ‘_Prince_’ articles in a daze, searching for a raison d’êtrê for the publication. ‘_Prince_’ writers, in turn, exploit the distraction and frustration produced by the reader’s attempt to understand why the ‘_Prince_’ is produced to write the same article over and over again without anyone noticing.,To write the standard ‘_Prince_’ article, the author carefully structures a basic narrative. First, a change is proposed. The change has backers and detractors. The author selects a prominent student to argue for change and randomly selects someone to provide a dissenting voice. This means that the person supporting change usually has something to say to support their position and the dissenting voice is often barely capable of speech.,In this week’s article on Terrace’s proposed admission of Graduate Students, the ‘_Prince_’ nails its own format. The discussion is amorphous—“I think it’s going to require a little more thought”—and unhelpful. If the reader happened to be interested in the topic, the article would be a poor place to find information about it. Everything seems thrown together—the article even wears its half-baked nature with pride when the author confesses that she “quickly found out” that the information she gave one of the two dissenting voices cited in the article was inaccurate. Before the reader catches on, the article is over and yet another unsuspecting student has been spoon-fed the standard ‘_Prince_’ Article.,Revised headline: “Terrace: Sketchy”,__Buford ’12: Life after whistle-blowing__,by Rachel Jackson,There is one other type of article that the _Princetonian_ publishes—the ‘_Prince_’ exposé. In these articles, the courageous staff at the ‘Prince’ step up their game and fearlessly investigate something on campus, producing a tell-all article revealing the sordid side of their subject matter—all while maintaining the difficult-to-capture diplomatic tone of professional journalism. Or at least, that’s what the ‘_Prince_’ staff thinks they do.,These articles truly catch the self-congratulatory tone of the _Princetonian_. Only in _The Daily Princetonian_ will you not only read the shocking tale of John Buford ’12, who endured severely humiliating hazing while pledging a fraternity, but also a follow up article on this momentous “whistle-blowing” and the newspaper that broke the story, your very own _Daily Princetonian_.,This article again airs the most humiliating details of Buford’s pledge events, such as drinking more than 20 oz. of another man’s tobacco spit and being bitten by a stripper. Despite the article’s lofty goals, at this point the reader beings to seriously entertain the possibility that the ‘_Prince_’ is writing about Buford again just to get to put this material in print for a second time.,Princesposés are also a classic example of the ‘_Prince_’s tendency to do exactly the opposite of what it intends. In “Life after whistle-blowing” Rachel Jackson struggles valiantly against the ‘_Prince_’s tendency to render a moderately intriguing subject wholly uninteresting while basing its analysis off of typecasting and oversimplification. Unfortunately she succeeds in doing the exact opposite.,Buford’s closing words offer a glimpse into why the ‘_Prince_’ has found him to be such a kindred spirit:,“‘When you read it, it sounds really dramatic and serious. It was really dramatic and serious at the time, but, you know it happens,’ [Buford] said. ‘It’s given me lots of stories. You know the times with the prostitutes and strippers. I feel very worldly, even though I’m definitely not.’”,Indeed.,Money quote: “‘I’m a Republican. I very rarely crusade about anything.’ – John Buford ’12”,Revised headline: “20 oz. to freedom”,__Legacy for a day__,by Joey Barnett,It’s a ‘_Prince_’ standby for authors to wax nostalgic about their hometown when they run out of ideas. Joey Barnett takes this to the next level—he has published a veritable canon on his city of origin, Tulare, California. In his most recent Tulare-based column, Barnett somehow manages to weave his place of birth into an otherwise unrelated article about the virtues of being a legacy at Princeton. One wonders if ‘_Prince_’ writers develop a “hometown reflex” that causes them to crank these articles out involuntarily.,To Barnett’s credit, he doesn’t mire the reader in too much of the usual muck of ‘_Prince_’ self-reflection, in which the author buries the reader in the minute details of his or her everyday life. The editorial page often reads like an atrocious series of blog posts synopsizing writers’ humdrum daily lives, producing articles that are as painfully mundane as their subject matter.,Revised Headline: “Tulare: City of dreams”,__Without direction__,by Nathan Mathabane,The Opinion pages are a great place for ‘_Prince_’ writers to show off their standby journalistic move: the extended metaphor. Nathan Mathabane’s article on Princeton academics opens with one of the most involved and extended metaphors recently seen in the pages of the ‘_Prince_’.,“You are standing at the threshold of a massive, tangled, over-grown jungle. It is not a jungle of gnarled trees and lofty canopies, winding rivers and dangerous pitfalls. It does not contain poisonous frogs, disease-ridden mosquitoes or flesh-eating barracudas, but at times it can seem just as scary and overwhelming. This jungle is built of stone buildings and libraries, websites and papers. This jungle is called Princeton academics.”,This epitomizes the ‘_Prince_’ metaphor as it manages to last an incredibly long time without actually saying anything. Like the rest of the ‘_Prince_’, the word-count-to-content ratio is stratospheric. Instead of trying to create a cohesive vision of an article and execute it, ‘_Prince_’ writers seem obsessed with overworking the necessary component parts of their articles—introduction, conclusion, attempt at humor—and never form them into a cohesive whole.,The only question is—will the next editorial be more rococo and uninformative than the last?,Revised headline: “Welcome to the jungle!”,__Editorial: An even better way to P/D/F__,Expanding the “P/D/F” option seems to be the crusade that unifies the Editorial Board. The Board—which seems to have a center-left take on matters political and a center-crazy take on campus issues—puts the full force of its influence behind expansions to “P/D/F.” After the landmark increase in the time allotted to “P/D/F” a course, it seemed plausible that the ‘_Prince_’ might move on to other topics. Instead, the minutiae of the grading system seem to be what’s on everybody’s mind over at the old Princetonian.,The only thing more absurd than the Ed Board are the cartoons that are published underneath their articles. Predictably, the cartoon from last Friday is about “P/D/F.” Suffice it to say that it was like every other cartoon in the ‘_Prince_’: upon first glance, it is confusing. Upon second inspection, it is demonstrably unfunny. ,Revised headline: “P/D/F every day”,__Sports__,The titles on a ‘_Prince_’ Sports page look like a brainstorming session to find synonyms for “defeat” and “mediocre.” This is just one element of the ‘_Prince_’s broader campaign, which aims to record all of Princeton’s athletic losses in meticulous detail. It’s somewhat surprising that the sports teams haven’t asked the ‘_Prince_’ to tone down its coverage—there seems to be little need to write a long-form essay about another football defeat.,Revised headline: “The mausoleum of all hopes and desires”",http://www.nassauweekly.com/princewatch-2010/,"

", Timothy Donnelly’s new collection of poems, is a difficult book. That is to say, it’s much more complex than the poetry I usually read. I’m a fan of talky poets, writers like Dean Young and Tony Hoagland who, even when they’re being opaque or experimental, give each of their poems a loose narrative arc. Reading them is like having a conversation with a good friend: there are starts, stops and detours, but also a shared logic that makes you both feel like you’re going somewhere. Donnelly’s collection is knotty and complex in comparison; it’s beautiful reading, but it takes time to understand. Where other poems are chatty, these are cerebral. ,Donnelly is the longtime poetry editor of , and an assistant professor of creative writing at Columbia University. He published his first collection, ,, in 2003, and wrote these poems over the course of the next six years. The new collection reflects both his academic background and his poems’ long development: it’s full of dense, thoughtful pieces that pull in a variety of texts and references and try to place them in the poet’s world.,Like many of us, Donnelley is preoccupied with the myriad and weighty concerns that have defined American culture since the early aughts: among them, war, torture, and finding his place in an expanding, fractured world. Unlike many of us, he sees these things through a frame of literary reference. So his “Dream of a Poetry of Defense,” for instance, isn’t only about poetry or just about national defense. Instead, it’s a mash-up of words from Shelley’s , and ,, a mixture of the literal and metaphorical that makes sense in both realms. ,Although it takes up the work of a lyric poet, “Dream of a Poetry of Defense” isn’t necessarily meant to be read aloud. The poem benefits from being voiced; it has a steady rhythm that underscores both its rationality and its nonsensicality. But it also rewards pausing and rereading. Donnelly’s syntax and wordplay can trip you up on the first time through; his grammar is, as a friend of mine put it, “masterfully stacked and inverted.” Maybe it’s my own mental scatteredness, but as I read through , I found myself stopping to look up familiar words, expecting them to suddenly mean something new. Donnelly makes it difficult to take meaning for granted. He has a knack for making the familiar unfamiliar. He puts the reader to work.,If you’re willing to do the work, the poems are incredibly rewarding. They offer meaning on many levels: not only are they cerebral in themselves, they ask questions about what it means to think. A few months ago, Donnelly told , that his poems “aim to capture the movement of a mind through thought.” That’s an artful way of saying that they wander, interrupt themselves, and constantly double back. They don’t feign knowledge; they’re insatiably curious, both about their own boundaries and about the boundaries of the human mind. We can see that in “Poem Beginning with a Sentence From The Monk,” in which Donnelly, sitting in prison, recounts his thoughts:,Thoughts to which a mind should not be driven,
  drove me through a bank of devilment in flower.,Thoughts to which the mind had grown immune,
  soon sickened me against me, turned me,
in among me, stranger than before, my quarantine a panic,
  room bricked in, a tightening around me,in increments only animals know.,At first, the poem explores the lines between sanity and insanity, quarantine and freedom. The poet delineates those boundaries, and then crosses them, through thought: literally, he’s just sitting down and thinking. Later in the stanza, though, Donnelly constructs thought as itself a sort of prison. In other words, the act of thinking doesn’t just make us aware of our boundaries—it is a boundary, and it can shut the poet off from the rest of the world. Donnelly wants to depict thinking as a type of movement, but he also shows how often it locks us in one place.,Trapped in his own mind, the poet occupies a particularly anxious space. He wants to connect with others, but never can. Donnelly’s poems reflect this tension; everything he sees is personal, but removed. In “The New Histrionicism,” he stages a medieval Irish story in his own garden—then withdraws to an upstairs window to watch. Once he separates himself from the scene, the poet loses his authority as well. At a crucial moment in the action, the house goes black. “A struggle between the darkness and the sense I control it,” Donnelly says, “ends abruptly. The darkness is not nice.” ,This is ,’s central worry: that extended thought will leave the poet and reader trapped, isolated, and ultimately impotent. That we will each be caught in an individual darkness, and it will not be nice. What Donnelly doesn’t seem to realize, at first, is that the kind of thinking his poems represent—thinking that is intertextual and referential—inherently connects people to other people. Because it reaches out to new texts and ideas, this kind of thought can never really seal itself off from the world. ,I’m tempted, perhaps unfairly, to compare Donnelly with Tao Lin, who’s also interested in how the mind works and scared of being alone. He and Donnelly cover some of the same affective ground, but many of Lin’s poems are so introspective that they do cut off the poet from anything outside himself. In “Washington Mutual Is A Bank That Is Everywhere,” for example, he writes:,There should be something about you,
in this poem. But,there is just me, being stupid.,
Putting shampoo on things. My roommate’s shampoo. Uncouth. My heart,
is a bar of soap. White, flashing. Soap,
is clean. Admit it. That it will kill you,
if you eat it,
probably. I mean, look,
at this poem. Where are you. I love life.  November. Wonderful. The sun. A cloud,
just said something. I don’t know what it said.,
I wasn’t paying attention.  I don’t care.,Lin takes a willful turn inwards, and it leads to fracture. He accumulates objects, but doesn’t connect with them. His final line sounds flip, but it’s devastating; by focusing his thoughts increasingly on himself, Lin removes the possibility of comprehending, or even acknowledging, another person. Donnelly, in contrast, begins to realize that he has other options. In ,’s final poem, “His Future As Attila The Hun,” he writes,,But when I try to envision what it might be like to change,,
I see three doors in front of me, and by implication,opportunity, rooms full of it as the mind itself is full,
thinking of a time before time was, or of the infinite,couch from which none part.,Donnelly alludes to Edward Gibbon’s account of Attila’s life in ,—that is, he actually reaches outside himself and connects with another text. More importantly, he shows that thought can be productive, not merely constrictive. Instead of boundaries, this kind of imaginative thinking creates possibilities. In the wrong hands, that move could seem trite—after the artist’s long struggle with self-doubt, imagination and creativity swoop in and save the day—but here it’s appropriate. Donnelly recognizes that he’s in some ways trapped, but he also comes to terms with his prison’s potential. As he puts it in “Poem Beginning with a Sentence from The Monk”:,And although I have often felt buried alive,
like an architect in the tomb it was his dumb luck to design,
for a paranoid king…,I see no reason why, given a modest,
number of revisions, I couldn’t grow to love it.,I love this idea of revision as a cornerstone of productive, optimistic thought. While Lin moves relentlessly forward, abandoning things along the way, Donnelly looks back and takes stock of both where he’s been, and what he’d like to change. That’s the way thought actually works: it’s not linear, it’s repetitious. It accounts for its influences and turns and, in that way, always builds something.,In an unintentionally brilliant final move, Donnelly ends his collection with two quick pages of notes to the reader. He lists outside texts and authors and connects them to his poems. He builds us a lovely little index; it’s really quite thoughtful of him.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/cloud-corporation/,"

"Jo was sitting behind the counter of Beacon’s Closet in Williamsburg. Her friend and co-worker Cathey was working the register and telling Jo about her most recent purchase at Strand Bookstore in the Village:,“It’s like an annotated version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, but instead of just writing about what is going on, there are litho pieces describing what Joyce is feeling and trying to express. It’s a little bit harder to dig into, but I think the comparative artwork is really fascinating. Plus, I always thought that people focused on Ulysses too much. I’m so over it. You know?” Cathey said as she bagged a gold sequin beret for a fifteen year-old girl and her mother just visiting the city to do a little shopping before heading back to the north shore. Those people didn’t understand Cathey’s intellect. None of the little girls who came into Beacon’s knew her craft, or what she stood for. ,Jo wasn’t listening. She was tapping her horned necklace on the glass-top counter in front of her. Jo was a beautiful girl, but it was obvious from her demeanor that she tried very hard for people not to perceive her that way. He brown hair was cut short in a pixie-esque ‘do, but if tousled the right way it looked like the bowl cut your mother gave you in the first grade.  She wore a pair of large, black plastic-rimmed glasses, and had a sizeable silver ring jutting out from her septum, making her look like a bull. She wore a white tank top with black suspenders. Jo forgot to wear a bra that day, though, and the straps of her suspenders were positioned just enough on the outside of her breasts to show her nipples, made rock-hard by the blasting air conditioner. She wore a pair of cut off denim shorts that exposed her lithe porcelain legs. They were thin from years of cocaine abuse. On her feet she wore a sturdy pair of vintage black leather ankle boots, which she found on eBay last week while searching for “vintage black leather ankle boots.” As she slouched over the display case, carrying the weight of infinite musical knowledge on her shoulders, Jo was the picture of everything hip. ,Milo walked through the front door of Beacon’s Closet. It was late August in New York, and he had gotten caught in one of those mid-afternoon showers while getting off the Manhattan bound L train at Bedford Avenue. He was coming from his band’s practice back in Buschwick. Milo’s hair was damp from the rain. He wore a vintage New York Knicks hat over his matted hair, which ended in two massive blonde dreadlocks. He was tan from skateboarding around his neighborhood in the hot Buschwick sun. His multi-colored Afrikan-inspired, fitted, yet still loose t-shirt gave way to his tapered orange jeans. They fit just perfectly for Jo to see the outline of his member. He wore the Knicks colored Starburys, that he had customized himself with a Sharpie one day as he tripped balls in Green Central Noll Park. Milo was on the short side, 5’5” at best, but there was something about the way he walked, the way he led his whole body with his hips, that caught Jo’s fancy., Suddenly Jo had a flashback of the encounter she had the previous night with her best friend. He worked in the vegan supermarket around the corner. She had so many feelings wrestling inside her and really needed someone to flesh them out. Milo was that man. ,Milo walked up the stairs and turned left into the Men’s Department. Jo slipped away from Cathey’s diatribe about the newest international graffiti exhibit at a small gallery on the Lower East Side. Jo passed through the entrance to the men’s section. There Milo was, eyeing a brown leather jacket in the mirror. Because of the way he was posing, his T-shirt was lifted just enough to show his jutting hip and the little wisps of happy trail leading down to his belt buckle. Jo felt her heart rate increase. ,“Hey. Can I help you with anything?” Jo said. ,“What?…” Milo was concentrating so hard on how awesome he would look in a coat that he could pretend he found in his father’s closet. “Oh, um, yea, actually I’m looking for an outfit for my gig tonight.”,“You’re in a band?” Jo’s heart skipped.,“Yea, we’re called Pig Basin. We play, like, indie-funk music. I’m the French hornist. We’re based in Bushwick, actually,” he said with a half-smile and a small laugh. Sometimes even he had to laugh at himself. Jo wasn’t laughing, though. She could feel her lower half start to tremble. A French Hornist? When would she ever have an opportunity like this again? Jo had already started forming the story she would tell to her friends at their weekly coffee at the Bowery Poetry Café. ,“Really? That’s so awesome. I live in Williamsburg, but I’ve always wanted to move to Bushwick. Williamsburg is dying. You Know? I’m over it. Bushwick is it.” Jo began to focus on Milo’s lips. They were slightly pursed as he listened to her. ,“Yea, no, it’s a great area. Really authentic. I like it.”,“How did you guys meet each other?”,“Well, we all met at Brooklyn College. I went to Collegiate and got into Columbia, but I wanted a more genuine New York experience, so I went CUNY.”  Milo started to eye Jo. He watched as her nipples became harder underneath her tank top. There was something about her waif-ish, slightly masculine body that got him wondering whether she was “a pink or a brown.”,“Yea, I totally know what you mean.” She didn’t. Jo was originally from Lake Forest, Illinois, a wealthy suburb of Chicago. “Well that jacket is great but I think I have the perfect thing for you in the back. Do you want to see it?” Jo said with a wink and as much of a smile a girl of her demeanor could give. ,Milo caught on pretty quickly. “Yea I’d love to.”,Jo grabbed Milo tight by the hand. She led him past the front counter, into the dress room, and up the stairs in the back. Milo had always wondered what was up there—turns out that it was just racks and racks of clothes waiting to be appraised and shelved.,“So what is this magical clothing i….” Before Milo could finish his sentence, Jo had already pounced on him. She kissed him deep. Deep like the ocean deep. Deep like the depths that she hoped Milo could reach. She let everything go when she kissed him, and was happy when Milo reciprocated. He grabbed her side with one hand and gently grazed her face with the other. The kiss was passionate, yet sweet. Milo put pressure on her hips, and pinned her against the wall.  ,Jo undid Milo’s belt buckle. As she did this, Jo pulled away from his face momentarily to ask him, breathlessly, “Where are you playing tonight?” ,Milo leaned in close to her. Jo was slightly taller than he was but he managed to nuzzle his lips right on the small of her neck beneath her ear and whisper “Hugs.” Jo let out a low moan. “Tell me more,” she said in the same voice as before. ,“I’m doing a live mash-up show with Boody B and Harrison Schaaf for Palms Out Sounds,” he uttered as he slipped one…no, two…no, three fingers into the waistband of her Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers boys underwear. “God I love how much you remind me of a younger me.”  As he said that Jo lost control. She was about to make incomprehensible love to a man with golden dreadlocks who played the French horn. ,“I love it when you talk dirty,” Jo said. ,Their bodies undulated together as Milo worked her into a frenzy. And then that moment came. The room seemed smaller, as her body tightened around Milo’s. Jo fell back onto the vintage chair where a pile of untagged vintage t-shirts lay. Milo pulled his pants up as he looked at the work of art he had created in the chair. He walked over to her and brushed the strands of hair out of her face. Jo looked up at him, and Milo gave her a smile. Then she dropped mad knowledge on him. ,Milo walked down the stairs and out of the store, without purchasing a single thing. His mind was elsewhere. ,He pulled his phone out of his pocket as he walked towards the train. He called up his friend L,“Yo, L”,“What up?” ,“I hit.”,“What else?”,“Plus dome”,“Say Word?” ,And he got it on that night.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/hipsterotica/,"

"BLAUW! Was I the only one who was missing the King of Pink, the don of  Harlem, the sole reason why I utter “no homo” after  any questionable sentence, Cameron “Cam’ron” Giles? Well he’s back in action with the first single off his new album Crime Pays, Bottom of the Pussy Hole.  The song dropped on September 10th, over ten months since the last time we heard from Killa Cam. ,Public Enemy #1, Cam’s first mixtape and most recent recording, was released on November 7, 2007 and most talking heads in the hip hop industry thought it was the end of Cam’ron. He had just been kicked out of  the DipSet, the group that he had founded with current DipSet president Ezekiel “Freaky Zeeky”  Jiles (no relation), and moved to SRC records.  While Cam said that he was okey-dokey after the break-up, the stinging lyrics of the Intro to Public Enemy #1 shows a different attitude towards his former Byrd Gang affiliates. In the introduction, Mr. Giles urges the current members of the dipset to put rings on their toes and bellybuttons, and “get ya eyebrows arched after that.”  Cam has a knack for emasculating his adversaries while simultaneously prompting questions from the hip-hop community about his own sexual preferences. For example, when explaining the meaning of the expression “no homo” on the Angie Martinez show, he said, “Yo Jim [Jones], Imma beat my dick on you till the white stuff comes out. No homo.” But in Pussy Hole, Cam is putting all of his sexual energy into the ladies. ,Much like Ghostface Killa of the Wu Tang Clan, Cam’ron is known as the heart of the DipSet by his fans, and he delivers in Pussy Hole. The intro to Pussy Hole is similar to many of his other love ballads, like On Fire Tonight and Weekend Girl.  The piano twinkles under a sound clip of the now infamous Alexyss K. Tylor,  host of “Vagina Power,” an Atlanta public acsss television program. Ms. Tylor sets up Cam’ron’s raison d’etre for creating this great piece of sexual-social commentary. Tylor states that when a man hits the bottom of the pussy hole, a feat only someone of John Holmes’   stature could do, a woman would lose her mind because “the penis has ejaculated all in her brain.” Cam proceed to give an “apology” to all of the women who he has made insane by his sexual prowess and LONGevity. ,This song is a departure for Killa Cam– not in content, but in the style of his rhymes. Critics have railed Cam’ron for his weak flow and use of imaginary made-up lyrics, or nonsensical words. In Crown Me, for instance, Cam utters, “Man it’s nothing I eat those/Then I piss off my fowl, I lay for it/Car, crib, credit, A-1 Steak Sauce.” Lines like these have sparked numerous parodies of the MC, including viral sensation “Dipset the Movie.” ,But all of the lines in Pussy Hole make sense, at least to those versed in Camronics.  In the sultry, slow, even-toned raps his fans have come to love, Cam tells the story of his escapades with a fine young piece and how he changed her life by hitting the bottom of her punani. His voice rides cleanly over the lyrics he spits, even when they somehow don’t actually rhyme. ,One of the better lines in the  song is, “And you gotta love it/when she came over she touched it/ Pussy Hole? Hit the bottom of it.” OK, it’s not quite on the level of Big L (greatest rapper dead or alive from none other than Cam’s hometown, Harlem, USA) but those great one-liners are what makes a Cam song a Cam song. ,Overall, Bottom of the Pussy Hole is a strong comeback from Cam, but there is just one burning question that I have left: ,Yo Killa, what exactly is the bottom of the pussy hole?",http://www.nassauweekly.com/killa-camron-digs-deep/,"

"In the video for the first single off his new LP _The Appeal: Georgia’s Most Wanted_, Gucci Mane, sporting space-age bug-eyed sunglasses, a grey keffiyeh and a mink around his head, asks his audience, “Do you know what time it is?” The answer, of course, is Gucci Time. _The Appeal_, which dropped September 28, is Gucci Mane’s third major label album, and marks a period of time what will probably be known as the apex of his career. Gucci boasts to MTV that _The Appeal_ is a ‘masterpiece.’ ,Gucci Mane has come a long way from his first gasps at fame in 2005, which marked the release of his first independent album Trap House.  His first single was the played-out middle school classic “So Icy.” Young Jeezy drives the track, offering the first two verses, and Gucci Mane finishes off the track with a flow and lyricism typical of any southern rapper in the game at the time. He talks about how much icy he has and how much women he got in a staccato similar to Young Joc et al. The production was cheesy and so were his gold Versace glasses. ,It wasn’t until 2007 that Gucci Mane was catapulted into his contemporary stardom with the release of the banger “Freaky Gurl” off _Hard to Kill_. The sound was different. The beat was a stripped bassline, a far cry from the overproduced synths of _Trap House_. Gucci’s flow had matured. Gone were the days of energetic simple rhyme schemes. Gucci’s flow had slowed down. He was rolling on his lyrics like they were the pills he took the night before. ,And Gucci’s image had changed too. In the “Freaky Gurl” video he seemed sillier, more fun. Gucci mean mugged the camera too hard to be taken seriously. When he crooned, “Don’t you think I’m handsome?” you couldn’t help but laugh at his goofy grin. The line in the chorus “then you get some brain in the front seat of the hummer” was fantastically chauvinistic. He was so delightfully overconfident. The cult of Gucci Mane was born. ,Since _Hard to Kill_, Gucci Mane has released three independent albums including _The Appeal_, two major label albums, two EPs, and almost 20 mixtapes. That in and of itself is enough to solidify Gucci Mane’s influence on the hip-hop blog circuit. The man released six mixtapes in 2010 alone! ,In the age of the Internet, rappers have to keep their fans interested at all times. Releasing a studio album every other year no longer works in the world of 30-second clips on Gawker, and Gucci knows it. So in preparation of the release of _The Appeal_, Gucci Mane released the aptly named _Buy My Album_ mixtape less than a week before the album drop in order to generate more noise around the Gucci machine. ,To be honest, _Buy My Album_ is at best a doorstop.  The mixtape has eight tracks, three of which are freestyles. The production value is similar to his early years. It is dominated by DJ Holiday adlibs and promotional shout-outs.  The rhymes in his freestyles are very weak. It basically sounds as though Gucci woke up one morning and decided to record a mixtape. In fact, this is probably what happened that morning:,DJ Holiday: Yo, Gucci! Gucci, wake up. It’s 11 o’ clock.  We gotta record this mixtape. We told people we’d do it already. C’mon man, it’s due. ,Gucci: [clears throat] It’s due?,DJ Holiday:  It’s due! That’s alright. [pause, sound of keyboard typing, papers shuffling] I got some beats; you can spit some bars. I’ll talk over the tracks. It’ll be good. Drink some juice, wash your face, I’m coming over. ,Gucci: Yeah alright, partner. I’m getting up now.,Yeah, I’m pretty sure that is exactly how it went. ,But that doesn’t matter. The Cult of Gucci Mane doesn’t listen to him because he’s a talented rapper. Sure, he had some good jokes in his verse on “Pretty Boy Swag” and “Oh Le Doit,” but he’s no Big KRIT. He has some amazing production, but not always. The Cult of Gucci Mane loves him for that novelty. ,On August 29, Gucci Mane performed at the McCarren Pool Party Concert series at the East River Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Needless to say, the crowd was predominately hip, white, suburban 20-somethings. After the crowd waited around for an extra hour, Gucci Mane stumbled on stage looking, well, fat and sweaty. He crooned his way through a couple of his verses on other people’s tracks. The crowd, including myself, went wild. And after fifteen minutes he retreated backstage. Gucci Mane was paid $60,000 to perform that day. Either way, the audience got their money’s worth, because all Gucci needed were those fifteen minutes to preach his gospel. ,And so I guess that’s what _Buy My Album_ is: the latest sermon from the gospel of Gucci. So buy that album, and think of it as a second collection for the Gucci Mane roof fund.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/buy-guccis-album/,"

"Sarah Palin is the politician Jonathan Swift would have imagined for this century if he were living in it. An attractive woman with some sort of strictly defined set of morals, she has exploded onto the scene because she is a masterful spin doctor, a skilled manipulator of her image, and someone who has found a way to flourish in modern America, despite lacking the obvious characteristics one might imagine as necessary for a life of public service (brains, ideas, experience, to name the most obvious). She is, of course, as much an entertainer as a politician—a celebrity above all—a strange thing but a natural development in this world of 24-hour news networks and multi-million dollar campaigns. It is perhaps jarring to think that CNN has as much to do with Palin’s rise as Fox, but it is stranger to see how Palin has chosen to further her career in these years between presidential elections, with her out of the governor’s office. When John McCain summoned her from the Alaskan wilderness in a desperate attempt to reclaim control of the presidential race in 2008, Palin was immediately one of the most controversial figures in all of America. Some were absolutely captivated by her, while others rued the fact that America had deteriorated to the point that someone like her could ever captivate the country. There were simultaneous arguments that Palin both lost the race for McCain and kept him in it, but no matter which side a person chose, it was obvious Palin’s career was just beginning. Today she’s one of the most important Republicans in the country, though she’s not actually in any office.  Her latest endeavor is _Sarah Palin’s Alaska_, a new show on TLC—the channel that brought us many shocking pregnancy tales such as “Obese and Pregnant,” “Paralyzed and Pregnant,” and “I Didn’t Know I was Pregnant,” as well as the now infamous “John & Kate Plus 8.” How Palin’s show falls into this sort of programming culture might seem ambiguous at first, but the viewer begins to realize that perhaps her life is just another story that we can gawk at together. ,The show is basically a chance for Palin to head into the outdoors, usually with a family member in tow, and to connect whatever experiences she has there with her own political beliefs. A particularly emblematic episode occurs when Palin takes her daughter Piper (and it should be noted here for those eager for a Bristol sighting that she is conspicuously absent from the first episode) into the wild in the hopes of seeing a mother grizzly. Excuse me, Mama Grizzly. ,Palin is, of course, a champion of these animals, who she believes are the types of critters modern American women should be emulating. She says of the bears, “They’ve got a nature, yeah, that humankind can learn from. She’s trying to show her cubs nobody’s going to do it for ya, you get out there and do it yourselves, guys.” Unfortunately for Palin’s theory, the TLC camera crew ends up capturing footage of the bear swiping at fish to feed her cubs, while her children splash around in the water merrily. But Palin has shown that she has never been defeated by reality’s unwillingness to conform to her theories and assertions. She seems entirely satisfied with the sighting, her beliefs unchanged. “Wow,” she says, four, five times. She is clearly awed by the power and grace of her home. Or at least she wants us to believe she is. ,Palin has seized upon that part of America that desires a leader no different from them, someone without a bunch of fancy degrees, someone with a large family and real home-based responsibilities. For some reason these people have decided that our leaders should not be top-of-the-class, accomplished doers, but instead Mike from down the street, and Claire from around the corner. Of course, Palin is neither of these, but instead a self-made megastar who plays up her apparent ordinary nature to seize control over the masses. But she says she’s just like you and me, so obviously she is.,Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Sarah Palin’s Alaska, besides Bristol’s absence, is that Alaska is really a beautiful place. For someone who has lived his entire life in New Haven, Connecticut, the sprawling pine forests and foreboding glaciers are a sight to behold. This is frustrating because these gorgeous sights are not narrated by an equally-awed, luscious-voiced narrator on PBS or the Discovery Channel, but in Palin’s unusual and oft-parodied Alaskan twang, which she uses to point out only the most obvious things. For instance, she chooses to explain why it’s more difficult to land an airplane on ice than on an airstrip at LaGuardia. Turns out, it’s because ice is very slippery. Who knew? The producers of the show are not here to show us Alaska, untamed, vast and majestic, but Sarah’s version of it. We watch her hunt, white water raft, and hike. We see a few scenes of her being a mother in her own house, with six kids running around, and even a few kids who are not her own. (At one point, Andy, a young friend of Palin’s daughter Willow, tries to head upstairs with the girl, but Sarah has none of it. Upstairs is a “no boys zone.”),Despite this apparent hands-on approach to living and parenting, there are some odd episodes of friction that often occur unbeknownst to Palin. Willow in particular seems rebellious and not altogether happy. She bails on an excursion to Denali National Park on account of a hurting back, after her mom won’t let her friend hang out in her room. And Piper, all of nine years old, points out that her mom is always on her BlackBerry, and then, mimicking her mother, says, “She’s like, ‘Hold on, I’ll be there in a second,” furiously stabbing her thumbs at an imaginary keyboard. ,All of these issues give rise to rather negative reviews. _The New York Times_ and _The New Yorker_, a pair of elitist journalistic enterprises, both published highly opinionated pieces about the show, and both wished Palin would stay in Alaska and not seek the presidency. I’m sure positive reviews for the show are out there that point out Palin’s humor, the lush Alaskan wilderness, and the apparent intimacy the show offers. But Piper’s sentiment about smart phone usage seems telling to me. Palin is not really all about Alaska, any more than she is all about the common American. There’s a selfishness to her, a cockiness, a star’s bravado. And though she puts up a 14-foot fence to keep the prying eyes of a writer who has rented the house next door from catching any glimpses of her day-to-day activities, Palin has no reservations about bringing America into her home. She doesn’t expect them to come away thinking anything’s wrong with her, but rather that she’s the ideal: the rugged frontierswoman with a burgeoning career, the doting mother and loving wife. ,If Palin had been discovered by TLC to shine some light on women who simultaneously revel in the wild and act as mothers, she might be something of a revelation. A person who seems so comfortable in her niche could speak to the limitless potential the vastness of America offers an individual with any passion, any background. But of course, this is not the first time we’ve all met Sarah Palin. And her abdication of the governorship, her campaigning around America for conservative House and Senate candidates this fall, and this foray into our living rooms suggest that this niche is just a stepping-stone, that Alaska is just a platform from which she might spring. But if Washington is what she seeks, she might have to look a little harder around her kitchen table. In two years Willow can vote, and I’m not so sure her allegiance is assured.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/sarah-palins-alaska/,"

"Gossip Girl airs Monday nights at 8 PM EST on the CW, though it was not always this way.  It premiered, last September, in a 9 PM Wednesday slot.  Then there was that writers’ strike; the show survived and relocated to Monday.  The second season premiered earlier this month, after a summer of Monday night reruns.  For the longest time, I thought Gossip Girl was one of the Gilmore Girls, or maybe a show about Missy Elliott.  I have not seen The O.C., save that one clip that everybody parodies with the gun and the Sadness and the Imogen Heap.  ,So. Gossip Girl is about a circle of teens living in Manhattan’s Upper East Side and their goonish, mostly despicable parents.  All involved are good looking, well heeled, and well dressed.  Like, really well dressed.  Sometimes the show feels like Masterpiece Theatre-style costume drama, but with more bass.  Gossip Girl is the nom de blog of the show’s narrator, an unseen but omniscient Scylla who publishes canards about and, identically, stirs up the lives of these kids.  I suppose we are meant, in 2008, to equate our viewing the show to the fictional experience of reading Gossip Girl’s blog entries and imagining the lives of the people described.  But I’m getting ahead of myself.,The show’s main kids are, in decreasing order of rich-assedness: Chuck, Blair, Nate, Serena, Dan, Jenny, and Vanessa.  In the first season, most of these folks are in their junior year at expensively named private schools.  They skitter about in limos and private jets and live in buildings that employ white-gloved doormen.  High school life is jittery and hyper-excited, fraught with soirees, brunches, cotillions, parties, and relentless, glittery opportunities to meet-scandalous.  They plot, scheme, talk, shop, text, connect, break up, fight, fuck, and reminisce to of-the-moment alternative and indie rock.  It’s Terribly Exciting 2.0.  Even the names of the cast have a similar sort of decadent, unworkable quality about them: Penn Badgley, Leighton Meester, Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford.  ,The show’s are characters of a comfortable sort of flatness, characters for which there is only a small, contained set of descriptors that play out mildly in various situations.  Blake Lively—the blonde sister of the traveling pants, you’ll recall—plays a marble-mouthed sun-child called Serena Celia van der Woodsen.  That’s a name you say like it’s an institution.  Serena’s a popular ex-party girl with a heart of gold.  Literally.  Nah, only figuratively.,Blair Waldorf is Serena’s best friend, a wincing, pouting, obsessive sort of person wrapped up in little girl clothes and round eyes.  She has baby-cheeks and lips like whoa.  Blair keeps a cartoonish coterie of loyal handmaidens, sycophants who never seem to muster up a personality or remain in the show for more than four contiguous episodes.  There were probably all kinds of difficulties negotiating longer-term contracts for some of these supporting characters; “minion bitch #3” is perhaps an unappealing line on one’s résumé.  ,Item!  Dan Humphrey dates Serena for most of the first season.  Dan talks too much and doesn’t have a trust fund, and he lives in Williamsburg.  He’s on financial aid.  But he’s number two in his class, published in The New Yorker, and is a good big brother to Little Jenny.  In Gossip Girl’s parade of adolescences we never had, I am, in not so many words, Dan Humphrey from Brooklyn, and so are you.  As the warm, wonderful Point of Identification, Dan is a pouting ninny in a fitted shirt, the guy who gets the dream girl but has to make sure everybody knows how disappointed he is with her sometimes.  Dan gets his cake and eats it too, masking his own brazen social climbing with shocked—shocked!—indignation about his spoiled friends and their unscrupulous behavior.  He even slams the bedroom door when he’s upset.,Chuck Bass is obviously the best character.  He’s a thing of pure camp, vaguely evil, vaguely British, all slimy and slithering and jaw thrust forward and tight pants.  In one episode, Chuck purchases a burlesque club.  ,The big/not big joke of the show is that these are all uniformly bad people.  They all suck.  We are meant to be—or perhaps it is less presumptuous just to say that the writers are—perpetually and mightily impressed with how naughtysexybad everyone is being.  Over the summer, a series of billboards promoting the second season plastered quotes from the show’s starchier critics over close-up photographs of the cast, undressed or fucking or getting there: “Mind-blowingly inappropriate,” “Every parent’s nightmare,” “A nasty piece of work,” and such.  ,Maybe I’m getting old.  ,And another thing: transportation is a non-event in Gossip Girl’s New York.  Nobody ever needs to take the subway because they all have chauffeurs and cars; nobody ever has conversations in chauffeured cars because, well, everybody has their own.  I lived in Brooklyn this summer, and took lots of subways, usually to cross the river.  I distinctly remember standing helplessly for twenty minutes in the Jay Street/Borough Hall station on a hot Saturday night and then sweating rocks in W 4th St. station for half an hour.  Gossip Girl takes place in a barely-there sort of New York City, nourished more by impression than by presence, all quick-cut establishing shots and casual name-dropping of landmarks.  Nobody sweats visibly.,It is at about this point that the author must admit his feeble claim to any kind of hard-fought, intensely personal defense of New York.  I grew up in New Haven, Conn., poster child for a more pragmatic kind of southern Connecticut than the sunny, sanguine one more common in the public imagination.  I watched the first two episodes of Gossip Girl in mid-August, sitting with my laptop on Amtrak’s Adirondack Line, travelling from Penn Station to Port Kent, NY.  Port Kent is not far from a cottage in the Adirondacks that my family was renting for a week.  My father, upon my arrival at the station, shared a conversation he had with an elderly couple while waiting for me.  They—like my family and I—had come from Rochester, NY, to vacation in the mountains, but instead of fishing, hiking, or kayaking, watching the Amtrak come in every day was their favorite Adirondack pastime.,This is all to say, in too many words, that Gossip Girl presents an idea of New York.  The series is called Gossip Girl, not 10021 or The U.E.S., but hazy and implicit in everything about it is the weirdness induced upon people interacting normally by the added variable that they are in New York.  What an abstruse testament to the power of place, that.  Extreme wealth is part of it, to be sure.  It is a Thing the characters have to deal with, a pat device to explain away character frictions, a partition that can be nicely rearranged like a piece of furniture to motivate whatever ugly decision or backstabbing might be needed.,But I’m only saying. I spent this summer working at a large investment bank in downtown Manhattan.  For ten weeks, I combed my hair, wore a shirt and pants, slid about the transit system, went out to fancy meals, and networked over expensive coffee and a mutual sense of obligation.  It was the summer, you recall, of oil prices, of Fannie and Freddie, of unemployment and ghosts in the mortgage woodwork, so there was always lots to talk and think about.  I swore a lot at work, but only because everybody else did.  That’s a thing about Wall Street, I think: the barriers to entry—the interview, the mystique—are shrouded in formality and stiffness, but once you’re in, it’s a men’s locker-room of shit-shooting, ass-slapping, and fat-chewing. ,Many days, my co-workers would jet off early from work to dates and drinks and dinners; sometimes they would even come back to the office at 10 PM after these events and do some more work before going home.  Regardless, the next day’s conversation would inevitably saunter toward how was the food, wasn’t the service terrible, why didn’t you order the scallops, I’ll bring Liz there next time.  There is a certain face of New York life that is entirely about the lobster risotto at Del Posto (“divine”) and the pommes purées at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon (“outstanding”), about drinks after work at Ulysses and bottle service at 205.  ,The conspiracy of Princeton, the Ivy League, and 2008 has turned a summer job in New York into summer-in-New-York, a kind of institutional, contrived fantasy that lures both the creative type and the consultant with the idea that, just by being in the city, your emotions will be more strongly felt, your ingenuity heightened, your dreams more palpable, your dumbass nights and weekends sexier.  These things are one and the same, the Gossip Girl reassembly of New York out of normal people and alternative rock, the restaurants, and the Princeton intern thing: all emerge from an expectation that the big city will fill in the gaps and elevate us, will make us forget how damn mundane and frustrating these things tend to be.,I am, in the end, unimpressed by drama; that is, the twisty, tightly packed stuff that writers of shows like Gossip Girl like to lob at their characters in order for their carefully workshopped personalities to blossom.  ,We’ll continue watching Gossip Girl, perhaps, like we look through old postcards or yearbooks.  We’ll speculate what it would have been like to watch it over the course of a school year, as though the show transpired in real time; what it would have been like to watch it with Kate or Shannon or definitely Erin, at least back when she said you looked good in red, before her flitting, girlish sarcasm started to sound programmatic and conditioned.  New York was a thing, sure, but only when friends from home asked where you were working this summer, or had to bring it up with your parents on the phone.  Otherwise, it was just a backdrop, a name assigned to the place where we got chocolate croissants, where we tried on goofy clothes, where we got on the train to work every morning, where we sang “Fuck Me Pumps” with exaggerated Winehouse sneer.  And there are the odd banalities we’d dig up, the mostly quiet moments we’d broach and let hang for ten seconds out of a noisy dinner.  How we’d see Keri Russell with her kid at Carroll Park on Sundays, how we’d buy Italian Ice and watch skinny kids play ball with a tattered hoop, how we’d walk the Brooklyn Bridge when the subway ended late at night and talk in hushed tones about Weezy, &c.  And it would all be a coarse microcosm of the big ideas we floated and kicked between us, about what it means to have a job, about New York landlords, about why Prospect Park is better than Central Park.,And so the first episode of Gossip Girl’s second season finds our heroes in the Hamptons, wrapping up their summers of hot lifeguards and bored wives.  Full disclosure: I watched this season premiere on my laptop while spending a few days in the Hamptons before school started.  Total coincidence.  Not all the storefronts are as clean and quaint as the ones in the show; the beaches sometimes have more sharp shells than sand.  If it gets humid, which it can, your seat back starts to stick to your shirt.  Get up.  Pour another glass of seltzer.  Sit down and adjust the dog-eared corner of your book.  Scratch yourself.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/gossip-folks/,"

For the non-nerds among you, Bean is the smartest, and smallest, of a group of preadolescents who are trying to take over a futuristic version of our universe. Somewhere in the series, he discovers that his genetic code was altered before he was born; he’s destined to hit a massive growth spurt in his teens, then die as a giant before the age of twenty. Bean is plucky and brilliant—but mostly, in my mind, he’s long-limbed and tragic. And there you have Bradford Cox.,It’s not that Cox—who has severely elongated limbs as a result of a genetic disorder called Marfan syndrome—is going to die anytime soon. I’ve just always felt a sense of dislocation in his work. Bradford, like Bean, is defiantly (N.B.: I don’t mean “definitely”) not like the rest of us. He’s looking at the world from a different vantage point, and his work (with both Deerhunter and his solo project, Atlas Sound) reflects that: there’s a lot of ambiance in your typical Cox record, a sense of gauzy confusion, and a detachment from everyday life. It’s not always sad, per se, but it’s different.,_Halcyon Digest_, Deerhunter’s fourth full-length album, has to carry all of that baggage, and at first it sags under the weight. Album opener “Earthquake,” for example, is equal parts impressionistic lyric (referenced within the first sentence are: memories, a dirty couch, and gray fog) and shimmery underwater effect. Cox’s voice drifts just between Lockett Pundt’s guitar and Josh Fauver’s bass, and you get the sense that he’s struggling to break through to the song’s surface. It’s a very good track, but it’s also par for the course with Deerhunter. There’s nothing particularly new here.,If you like Deerhunter’s previous work, though, that’s great news. Even better: the rest of the album only builds on that vibe. The first few songs are all classic Deerhunter: dreamy and haunting, even when they’re upbeat. Sonically, this is music for early fall; for the first day you put on a jacket and hug it around yourself, when the world seems a little crisper and a little lonelier all at once. Cox’s lyrics tackle that exact feeling, over and over. In “Don’t Cry,” he tries to calm a lonely little boy; in “Sailing,” he tells us that “only fear / can make you feel lonely out here. / You learn to accept / whatever you can get.” You get the sense that Cox has been working through this sense of isolation for a long time, and that he’s nowhere near finishing.,Instead of collapsing entirely inward, though, from this point on _Halcyon Digest_ begins to open outward. “Memory Boy” might be the closest Deerhunter have come to recording a pure pop song: it’s all jangly, R.E.M.-style hooks and clear, plaintive vocals. There are more pop echoes, intentional or not, as the album goes on. It’s easy to make a Beach Boys comparison on the chorus of “Desire Lines” (though it sounds even more like Grizzly Bear’s intricate chamber-pop), or to hear undertones of Thom Yorke in the drifting vocals on “Basement Scene.” More importantly, it actually sounds like the band is broadening their sound. There’s some new instrumentation—most appreciably, a saxophone on “Coronado”—and Cox’s voice is placed much higher in the mix, so it finally sounds like he’s singing to an audience, not himself. He’s going for a different type of introspection, here, almost approaching extroversion: as melancholy as ever, but also searching for genuine connection.,The weird effect of all this is that _Halcyon Digest_ does two contradictory things at once: It sounds exactly like a Deerhunter album while also sounding very different. That’s a difficult feat, but, again, it’s not that unusual for this band. Working through the last three or four Deerhunter releases, I was struck most by the sense of consistency throughout. Each of their albums has sparks of fresh ideas, but you don’t get the sense that they’re attached to a particular moment in time. They’re just strange, and interesting, and good. ,That brings me back to Bean. His character lives with a different sense of time than the rest of us; it’s accelerated, but also slowed down. He exists outside of traditional notions of linear time and development. Without belaboring the comparison, you could argue that Cox does, too. His work doesn’t always show a clear sense of development or regression; it manages to be experimental without dating itself. _Halcyon Digest_’s closing track, “He Would Have Laughed,” ends abruptly and inconclusively. Among other things, it’s a rejection of time, and a statement against ordinary ideas about how an album should be structured. _Halcyon Digest_ is, in many ways, an argument for making music that doesn’t adhere to standard ideas of how a band should or shouldn’t progress. At this point, I’m convinced.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/digesting-digest/,"

"Sarah Palin is a liar and I can safely assure you that no one gives a damn. In fact, even those who repeatedly trumpet this fact take little offense at the actuality. Of course Sarah Palin is a liar. Who isn’t? I don’t have to borrow upon the well-worn trope of lying politicians to explain why people do not respond to these accusations: Republicans aren’t the only liars in this campaign. In a recent article in Slate, “Lies, Damned Lies, and Barack Obama”, Farhad Manjoo draws upon three different fact-checking organizations, Politifact, FactCheck.org, and the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, to come to the conclusion that, during the past two or so months, McCain has “lied more often and more outrageously than Obama.” According to Politifact, the McCain campaign has made 22 “clearly deceptive statements” to the Obama campaign’s 12, since July.  There are what one might consider important differences in the kind of lies each campaign tells—the Obama campaign made zero “pants-on-fire” lies to McCain’s three—but that is only if you think the number of lies a candidate tells matters in the first place.,The simple, undeniable fact that both campaigns have lied basically cancels each other out. The only way to keep the high ground, unfortunately, is to keep the high ground. The moment you slip, the moment you get some mud on your coat, it is merely a question of degree and the judgment of degree depends on personal preference, discretion, what you ate for breakfast—vagaries beyond the reach of even the most reasoned argument. Manjoo explains, “Even if we could pin down every lie that each candidate tells, we’d never be able to reach a consensus about the seriousness of each deception… Judging political lies is a bit like trying to evaluate bad American Idol performances; we agree that they all kind of suck, but we can still have endless fights about which ones suck the least.”,No one has the high ground—at least when it comes to telling the truth. In fact, we care so little about candidates’ blatant fibs that Manjoo actually suggests that Obama lie more. Sarah Palin is flying over the Bridge to Nowhere in the plane she “sold on Ebay”—and McCain gets a poll bump? Wild, I know. But not at all surprising, and not really an occasion for despair either. What is an occasion for some serious thought not only for Democrats, but also for Americans generally are the woman herself and her fifteen minutes (and I assure you it will be seventeen at most) at the forefront of the national consciousness.,Americans do not like Sarah Palin as much as you think. How do I know this? It certainly isn’t confirmed by any poll I’ve seen. I have never examined her polling. Fact is, I do not even have to look at her ratings to know most Americans, if they got to know Ms. Palin, would promptly exile her to the country she so inexplicably brags about being able to see from her living room window. Even take the common wisdom that her presence on the ticket energizes the conservative Christian base. A large number of conservative Christians would be horrified by the Church Palin actually belongs to. From the time she was ten years old until the year 2002, Sarah Palin was an active member of the Wasillia Assembly of God. The Assemblies of God are a group of Pentecostal churches that are a part of the National Evangelical Association. As Pentecostal churches, they emphasize the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The dispensation of these gifts can be manifest in many different ways—in popular media, the performances of pastors like Benny Hinn gain the most notoriety. A man with a booming voice cries out “Fire!” as he touches a believer’s forehead and the believer falls to the ground in tremors, presumably touched by the Holy Spirit.,Yet in 1949 and again in 2002, the Assemblies of God explicitly condemned certain Pentecostal factions who made of the rare and poignant Pentecostal experience a circus show. Furthermore, they condemned a group known as the Dominionists, and Dominionist factions such as Joel’s Army and the Manifest Sons of God. These groups believe that they are called upon to create an army. By taking over political or social structures and affecting a vengeful theocracy, they will exact wrath upon non-believers and errant Christians (including “fellow” Evangelicals) who fail to assent to their message. ,All these actions condemned by the Assemblies of God and by the broader National Evangelical Association are the express practice of what is known as the Third Wave movement. Palin’s home church is not only involved in Third Wave activities which are “specifically condemned” by the General Council of the Assemblies of God, it repeatedly hosts a major figure of Morningstar Ministries, Steve Thompson. Morningstar Ministries is not just one of the most prominent ministries of the Third Wave movement; its founder Rick Joyner is a “prolific author of Third Wave and Manifest Sons of God theology”.,Without even broaching Palin’s present church’s association with Jews for Jesus, by staying within the realm of her offense to the Evangelical community itself, it is not hard to understand why conservative Christians wouldn’t like Sarah Palin one bit. And while the layperson may need a history lesson to understand what is meant by Joel’s Army or the Third Wave, you can be certain that the connotative power of these terms is far more palpable for conservative Christians, especially those who often have to, rather unfairly, answer for the sins of these rebel factions.,This is just one investigation of a host of questionable associations and actions surrounding Ms. Palin. Yet whether it is her inability to recognize and enforce the importance of chastity among her own family members, her refusal to choose sacrifice over self-interest in her governing style, or her family’s sustained connection to disloyal secessionist sympathizers, Sarah Palin is extremely unlikeable. Notice my terms: chastity, sacrifice, and loyalty. Want to know why everyone is asking the ugly duckling to prom? I assure you it isn’t her ungainly wink. It’s her diction. Do not be fooled. Sarah Palin is not charming. She is not charismatic. She’s nasty, extremely aggressive, and secretly pretty—aka the woman from Hell. But the woman has a good speechwriter and she knows how to deliver. More importantly, she knows her audience. ,It wasn’t until recently I began to suspect I was a conservative—a University of Virginia study confirmed my suspicion. Conventional Intro POL Wisdom: Democrat/ Republican is not the same as liberal/conservative. But how does that translate into the way we communicate and the way we campaign? If an election is about a candidate winning our hearts and minds, then how do you appeal to the hearts and the minds—to the morality—of the conservative Democrat as well as the liberal Democrat?,In his essay “What Makes People Vote Republican,” Jonathan Haidt writes that, “the second rule of moral psychology is that morality is not just about how we treat each other (as most liberals think); it is also about binding groups together, supporting essential institutions, and living in a sanctified and noble way. When Republicans say that Democrats ‘just don’t get it,’ this is the ‘it’ to which they refer.” As a lifelong conservative Democrat, I can attest to this fact. I strongly prefer the Democratic agenda and I have yet to seriously support a Republican candidate in my consciously political life. Yet when I listened to Sarah Palin speak, something in me stirred. I couldn’t stand her, yet something sounded…right.,What sounded right was her diction. Much as I know I will generally vote Democratic, when I listen to other Democrats speak, I often go cold. Take for example the oft-repeated mantra that it is inconceivable that someone could vote for a candidate exclusively because that candidate is pro-life. That is actually extremely conceivable. Not only is that a central part of my Catholic morality, it plays a pivotal role in many people’s largely secular morality. And while I would rather not have everyone march like lemmings to national demise in the name of Ford trucks and apple pie, I assign high value to loyalty: to family, to friends, and to your country.,Liberals believe that conservatives are immune to rational thinking; in reality, we simply do not find liberal rationale to be rational, or for that matter, fully ethical. The essential problem of Democratic strategy today is that it assumes its audience ascribes to a liberal moral code emphasizing fairness and stewardship, when in truth that may not be the case. Conservatives do not ignore liberal rationale because they are stupid or lazy or worship the sound-bite—conservatives simply speak a different ethical language, and it is a language liberals, and more importantly, Democrats could easily access to stunning advantage.,In his study, Haidt found that in addition to the Millian moral foundations of harm/care and fairness/reciprocity, there were three additional ethical systems: ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Liberals seemed to more strongly identify with the first two categories, whereas conservatives devalued these first two categories in relation to the remaining three. This does not mean that the Democrats have to change their priorities—it means Democrats have to change the way they communicate these priorities to conservatives, keeping in mind that they can appeal to both liberals and conservatives simultaneously.,Perhaps the most damning condemnation I have heard in opposition to torture came from a fellow debater at a summer program I attended during high school. Rather than use the standard liberal arguments—torture is a violation of our natural and civil rights, no one should be treated as subhuman, etc—she simply said, in her most forceful and powerful voice and with a determination which would make Ms. Palin flinch, “I believe in due process. I believe in American justice.” To this day, that is how I situate my repulsion towards torture. Not only does it nod to liberal morality in its appeal for justice and fairness, it appeals to conservative values by invoking the deeply American nature of this system of justice—and demanding our loyalty to that system and therefore our patriotism.,In a similar way, the most troubling thing about Sarah Palin is not that she lies. The problem is that she is not qualified, and in the very real event that John McCain would either pass or suffer a disease of old age during his presidency, like, say, Ronald Reagan may have, she would become the leader of the free world. So I wonder: why do the Republicans care so much about winning that they would actually put their country at such significant risk? It is an earnestly disturbed response to the Republican vice presidential choice—and it is the question the Democrats should be telling Americans to ask. At a time of war and crisis, is this how little the Republicans care about the fate of your country?,The conversation is not about whether or not Sarah actually supported the Bridge to Nowhere.  The conversation is this: in his re-election campaign former President Clinton promised to build a bridge to the twenty-first century. A decade into that century, the Republicans have offered us a sad variation on the theme. Sarah Palin didn’t just support a Bridge to Nowhere—she is the Bridge to Nowhere. And it is high time someone asked the Republicans for whose sake they want us to walk the plank.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/sarah-palin-seriously/,"

However, I believe that the self-pride of America can be better brought by the candidates such as Obama, because he cares about the environment and also said something the other day about educating people of different classes, which I personally believe is an important factor within today’s role of being within the presidency role in America.,MEGAN:  Okay, well, I appreciate your approaching me about this and having an honest conversation when you tell me your honest feelings about the situation.  However, in a time of–and it sucks to have to say it, because it’s so scary about the world, but I have to say it–when there’s us in a time of war, basically, is what we’re basically in right now, to be honest, it’s important to feel that you have the necessary protection against the people who keep wanting to fight with us.,ERICA:  Okay?  I agree?  I support Obama?,MEGAN:  But you can honestly see Obama fighting for our country instead of fighting for other countries?,ERICA:  Actually, Megan, yes, I do believe that I can see that, because with all of the problems in our world today, such as the war you mentioned, and such as money, and such as other bad factors such as global warming and poor people and sick people, I feel that Obama can probably definitely help us to fight those things because when he talks it’s very evident that he gets how important those issues are.,MEGAN:  Yeah, but that’s the same with McCain, and also, he was in one of the wars–not this war, one of the wars before this one.  And he’s been around for so long, so he definitely knows how to handle,important American issues as well as important issues not only in America.,ERICA:  That’s another issue I feel is important to raise up in terms of the discussion we’re having between each other about these politics in regards to our opinions about the political election.  McCain is so old.  He’s like, older than my dad and your dad combined.  Do you seriously think that he’s not too old to not die if he does or does not become President?,MEGAN:  Um, Erica?  Old people don’t just die all the time.  That’s a very popular misconstrued misconception about them.  It is so hard to watch America not understand the most important issues about America, like all of the problems in the world such as killing people and poor people, because the only important issues about America that they care about are age.  My grandpa is 73 years old, but he only died once last year.,ERICA:  Yeah, but Megan?  How would you feel about Palin becoming President?  Like, actually?,MEGAN:  Well, first of all, I don’t think she will become President ever, because of my previous comments that I mentioned before about how McCain won’t just die because he’s old.  But, also?  If she did become President, I think that she would be a good leader because she has a lot of kids.,ERICA:  So?,MEGAN:  So, in order to be a mom you have to know how to be a leader, like a leader to your family.  Unless the dad is the leader of the family, in which case you have to know how to be a good wife and mother, still.  So., ERICA:  That’s not about world leading.  Also, that’s very sexist, because I think mothers can be other things besides mothers and wives. They can be leaders, too.,MEGAN:  Right.,ERICA:  But look.  I’m going to be the first person to say this, but just because she’s a woman and I don’t want to vote for her doesn’t mean that I’m sexist.  Do I think she’s a woman?  Yes.  Do I think she would be a good leader?  No.  Do I think that’s because she’s a woman?  No.  Would it help her chances if she were a man?  Depends if he was hot.,MEGAN:  Okay, point taken.  But have you ever seen her when she’s speaking about important issues?  She’s really good, like, she definitely knows her stuff.,ERICA:  Could you be more specific as to how you feel this is the case?  This election is not about choosing between little things like, “Good morning, should I chew Orbit Sangria or Orbit Mojito?”  It’s about bigger things, like “Should I let these people die today?”  And, “Should I sign the Constitution?”,MEGAN:  Like, she was talking before, I think, about how you need to make quick decisions as a leader when you need to make a decision about something?  That is so true.,ERICA:  No, Megan, that’s not always true.,MEGAN:  Um, yeah, Erica, it is.,ERICA:  No, Megan, it isn’t, because what about that time when you were drunk and decided to hook up with Jay just because he was the only single guy in the house?,MEGAN:  Um, Erica?  I don’t know if we’re on the same page here, but I’m talking about the political election in regards to decisions about our country.  That’s not the same thing as hooking up with a guy.,ERICA:  Whatever,,MEGAN:  Plus, even if it is, that means you would make the worst president ever because of all of the decisions you’ve made that weren’t representing a good decision-making ability in regards to how you make your decisions, and choices.,ERICA:  What do you mean?  Could you be more specific in terms of what you were just accusing me towards?,MEGAN:  Like you made the decision to hook up with Evan even though you knew that he still had a crush on Amanda.,ERICA:  So what?,MEGAN:  So, I appreciate your coming to me and telling me that you feel that I made a bad decision during which I hooked up with Jay, but it takes one to know one.,ERICA:  Okay, Megan?  I’m finding it very difficult though, as a person, to feel the need to justify my actions towards you about small circumstances and situations such as the one you just mentioned about me and Evan in regards to Evan and Amanda, but I’m actually trying to be mature here, politically.,MEGAN:  Look, Erica?  I think that while I continue my conversing with you about such things, I should also keep reminding myself that I’m talking to someone who has openly disrespected me in private when she thought no one was listening.,ERICA:  I think that you might be acting insecure about who you’re picking to be president because you realize that they are underqualified, namely, McCain and Palin, and also because you’re getting chubby.,MEGAN:  Okay, Erica?  You’re starting to get aggressive towards both me and my personal body.  And even though you think I’m immune to comments and insults on your part towards my body from you about how you think my body looks, you’re acting very contagious if you believe that your words don’t affect me towards the way that I look at my body on myself while I’m evaluating it from a personal level.,ERICA:  I think that you misheard me.  I wasn’t calling you chubby like on your body.  I was saying that in terms of how you look at your candidates.  Chubbily.,MEGAN:  A lot of people in this house think that the way you approach ideas is stupid.  And honestly?  If you choose that it is your right to be bitchy and chubby, then that’s your right, okay?  You’re an, American, just like the rest of us non-immigrants.  Feel free to vote for whatever unpatriotic, celebrified candidate.  But you should probably stay away from me for a while.  Because now I’m just flat-out, pissed at you.,ERICA:  At least I’m not a bitch.,MEGAN:  You’re a bitch.  At least I’m not a bitch.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/political-discussion-between-two-girls-reality-tv/,"

"Dear pretties,,Instead of the usual how-do-you-do, we’d like to tell a story.,There once were two bears. Both were young and happy; both led pleasant and fulfilling lives. ,Or so they thought.,The first bear–we’ll call him Barry–liked to wake early in the morning. He would stretch and make his way to the creek, where he’d sit above the smoothed rocks and wait for salmon. Oh how the day would break through the clouds as he waited! Those heavenly streaks of green and orange, those sun-dappled leaves curlicuing across the otherwise frothy surface of the rivulet. He would wait and wait. He would scratch himself and scratch himself. He would listen. When a salmon finally leaped into view–and it always did, a salmon; it always leaped into view, though perhaps not for hours–Barry would snap to at once, pawing the fish from the creek and drawing it smartly to his maw.,He would chew and chew.,He would gulp and gulp.,He would smile, sated.,The second bear–we’ll call him Carey–did not enjoy such bear-y things. He was studious and shy. When most bears had gamboled to the local dance, he would slink off to his favorite tree and read. When female bears attempted to court him–for bear society had loosened its strictures somewhat; the girls were doing the asking as much as the guys, I mean–he would laugh nervously into his neck-fur. He did not enjoy fishing. He did not enjoy shaking trees in search of delicious foods. He did not enjoy skirting the encampments along the creek in search of human-smelling clothing items and feminine products.,And so he would read and read.,He would annotate and annotate, dutifully, the margins of his books.,He would look up the words he did not know, and the words he recognized but could not comfortably define, like ‘palimpsest.’,One night, after a particularly rowdy bear gathering in which much Bear Beer was consumed, Barry met Carey on a path near the bear village. Carey had been reading a rousing survey of the flamenco tradition, and Barry had been rubbing against potential mates. Barry was warm and drunk. Carey was sober as tree bark. Walking in opposite directions, they bumped into each other.,They stared and stared.,They glared and glared.,They growled.,Barry made the first move. He pushed Carey–gently at first, then harder–and claimed the latter was not a real bear. ‘You are not a real bear,’ he exclaimed besottedly, ‘you’re a human dressed in bear clothing. An embarrassment to our kind,’ he sneered.,Carey was incensed. ,He threw down his wonderful first-run monograph on flamenco dancing (Myers, J., Flamenco: Tradition and Form, Yale UP, 1997) and picked up a stone. Barry picked up a stone. They glared some more.,In a flash, they were at each other’s throats. Claw on flesh, flesh on flesh, teeth gnashing. They tumbled into the creek near Barry’s fishing spot. The water was cool. They clawed and clawed. They drifted swiftly downstream and into the night. ,They approached the waterfall.,‘Stop!’ came a cry from the black of the woods. ‘Stop doing this to yourselves! You’re different, sure,’ the voice–a female voice–implored, ‘but you’re not so different. You both scratch yourselves in the same places! You both like the smell of an autumn morning! You both love the forest and all who dwell here!’,And it was true. They did both love the forest and all who dwell there. But this night–oh reader, this night was something different entire, something awful. They approached the waterfall, a twenty-foot drop to a pile of rocks. ,Barry and Carey continued to claw at each other, aware perhaps of their impending doom but nevertheless unwilling to abandon the fight.,The slipped farther along. They washed over the crest of the waterfall. They disappeared among the rocks at its bed.,They were never seen again. And though all appeared normal among the bears of the forest, all did not feel normal. Something was missing. The mornings were never so bright as before.,* * *,This story is in many ways a delightful, humorous allegory for reading The Nassau Weekly, as you can well see. We will not insult your intelligence by making things too explicit. But we’ll give you a hint: Barry the Bear represents Barack Obama.,Enjoy the issue, enjoy the start of the semester, and be kind to one another.,Nasslove,,–Eds.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/beginning-year-properly/,"

"If I had five kopecks for every time an American friend has asked me about Russia’s take on Obama and the election, I’d have a hell of a lot of kopecks (but I’d still be poor – thanks, world economy!). The 140-odd million people who live here don’t all agree with one another. This is a fact sure to stun the mass media whose Obama-narratives afford only the most homogeneous characterizations of international populations and these populations’ response to the Democratic victory. This is hard news to break to my champagne-popping American amigos: most Russians don’t give two shits, or even five kopecks, about who sits in the Oval Office. ,One would think that Obama would have it in the bag with the Russians after McCain crawled into bed with Saakashvilli and threatened to kick Russia out of the G8. One would be wrong. The fact of the matter is that most Russians are racist. That may seem a heavy charge to lay at the feet of such a vast country, but it’s something I observe everyday. Even the most legitimately progressive of my friends readily admit that most of their fellow countrymen make judgments based solely on race, and the bulk of Russians I know readily admit to it in their own lives. It’s sometimes hard for me to imagine normal people casually admitting to being racist, but like so much else in Russia, things just work differently here. Racism is most obviously manifested in prejudice against Central Asians, Georgians, Azeris, etc, but there is definitely enough suspicion and disdain to go around. Though not as noticeable as the run-of-the-mill cultural chauvinism directed against Estonians, Poles, and Czechs, racism against blacks is a curious feature of Russian culture and one worth looking into.,I spent my second night of a trip to St. Petersburg staying in the apartment of a friend who was vacationing in Turkey for the week. Poking around his lavishly furnished living room (as one always does in such circumstances), I noticed two mahogany statuettes of Pygmies flanking the faux fireplace. Big childish eyes, huge lips, the usual “folk” art. I suddenly had the feeling that I had somehow gotten on the wrong flight and was actually at an auction house in Backass, Arkansas. “It’s normal,” the statuettes’ owner later assured me.,“Really? It would be considered quite unusual in the United States,” I offered.,“Yes, but you have blacks in America,” said my friend, “we don’t here, so they are considered very mysterious and ‘other’. It’s not really racism.” ,“They’re people; it’s the definition of racism,” I said.,“Sure, if you want to look at it that way.”,The whole conversation was oddly reminiscent of one I had just a few days ago with my landlady. In one breath she segued from an explanation of why Russians are never racist (“the Soviets advocated international friendship”) into a joke about evolution and blacks, complete with monkey noises. In fairness, the sound effects were for my benefit, because from the expression on my face she assumed that I didn’t get the joke. This actually happens quite a lot in Russia; people think I don’t understand what they’ve said, when in fact I’m just amazed that they’ve said it. ,Generally such charades are pointless, as the concept of racism, as we usually think about it, has no currency here. It is taken as a fact of life, and not a matter of opinion, that people from the Caucuses are crooks, Jews shrewd, and Central Asians uncultured. I would not be surprised if in wandering the city’s back alleys I were to stumble upon the St. Petersburg State Phrenological Institute or some other such entity. Political correctness is treated as a joke in Russia, and when a Nass writer finds something offensive…it’s probably pretty offensive.,What my friend with the Pygmies wasn’t kidding about what the sense of mystery that shrouds blacks in Russia. Russia’s exposure to blacks consists almost entirely of African students brought to the Soviet Union for higher education (few stayed) and what they see in American movies and music videos. I know I’m in a white-ass country when I am the local expert on “black culture.” Of the many wonderful innovations blacks have brought to and developed in America, none is more sorely missed here than rhythm. Watching Russians dance is like watching a slow motion replay of a middle school boy putting a spider down his partner’s dress. ,But I digress. ,When I say that I’ve checked my observations out with “my black friend,” I am not being the tiniest bit ironic. I’m one of the only guys I know in Russia who knows a black person, and if I count the half-black pop star I met last summer who lives here, but carries a Dutch passport, then I know two and could host a multicultural festival in my kitchen. I had been carrying around with me the nagging feeling that I was perhaps taking out the stress of living here on the whole culture in an unfair and, indeed, prejudiced manner. That’s when black-friend-number-one told me about the brick thrown through her window a month after she moved into university housing. Of course, every country has its violent morons and an isolated incident has little significance, but as she unloaded on me what it’s like to be black in Russia, the incidents of prejudice began to seem less than incidental. The real tragedy is how little energy is expended in the public sphere to combat racist attitudes. Off-color (no pun intended) jokes do less damage in the short term than bricks, but they do make otherwise well educated, cultured people look like jackasses. In the long run, they amount to the same thing: an accepted racial hierarchy.,Given the state of racism in Russia, what’s really amazing is that nine times out of ten, total indifference to the electoral process trumps any concern over the prospect of a black administration. The hyper trendy crowd wishes they were riding the Obama tidal wave, but they’re only splashing in a kiddy pool. Afisha, the journal of everything hip east of the Iron Curtain, put Obama on the cover of its November 3rd issue and even wrote his name in a trendy lower-case font. However, closer inspection of the magazine reveals that it contains no actual information or opinions about Obama or about the relevancy of his candidacy. Instead there is a multi-page time line beginning in 2005 cataloging Obama’s celebrity endorsements. I can’t say that I’ve read every (or indeed any) other issue of Afisha to confirm that such glib trash is par for course, but if there was ever a time to say something substantive in a biweekly about something to happen on November 4th, the November 3rd issue is the place to do it. Afisha addresses only the pop star angle of the Obama phenomenon, and its attitude of ignorance and indifference to the social and political ramifications of an Obama administration is well in keeping with that of mainstream Russian society.,Certainly one piece of the puzzle is the popular reluctance to acknowledge that the United States is a superpower and that its policies will affect Russia. In a major address last week, President Medvedev made no mention of Obama’s victory and apparently has since congratulated him only by telegram. The speech was about establishing the rule of law, extending presidential term limits, and most troubling for the West, stationing missiles in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. Many observers have been quick to argue that the recent naval tragedy in Vladivostok, where a technical failure resulted in the death of at least 20 sailors, demonstrates that the Kremlin cannot walk the walk. But my point is not that Russia is so weak that it must listen to America. My point is that we should listen to each other regardless of which country has the stronger military or economy. The so-called superpower syndrome (a fancy way of talking about an inferiority complex on a world-historic scale) has left Russia’s elite looking more like the go-it-alone Bush cabinet than anything else.,There is a fundamental difference between American and Russian mentalities. Politics is a boring topic of conversation here, because few people feel responsible for or in any way connected with their government. As an American who has been embarrassed since the age of thirteen by George Bush’s antics, a part of me used to envy Russia’s complacency. Now that I have something of which to be unequivocally proud, to paraphrase Michelle Obama, my voice is engulfed by a flood of pessimism. ,“All governments are the same.” “If Bush hadn’t invaded Iraq, someone else would have.” “There’s no difference between the candidates, the same people will control everything.” ,Such statements are typical, and not only from the mouths of moody teenagers. Only in the dark corners of dank computer labs with my headphones on and the volume on high have I found, through the magic of streaming news and the internet, people who take the idea of democracy seriously. Since the tragic death of Tim Russert, I’ve found it difficult to stomach cable news, or as it is better described, “infotainment”, but watching it as I am in a country where the government is totally unaccountable and no one cares makes even the likes of Keith Olbmerman and Arianna Huffington tolerable.,The charges I hear from Russians, that American freedom is imperfect and therefore non-existent, that our elections are controlled by parties and therefore perfunctory, are as absurd as they are commonly expressed. Obviously the United States is not perfect, but the difference in mentality of which I speak is that which leads Americans to think that can they can always do better. ,Limiting as the two-party system is in the United States, it at least provides a forum within the mainstream for argument and discussion. The Russian political sphere lacks this kind of space. The government effectively controls who is allowed television time and who is limited to Echo Moskvy, a radio station popular only with the intelligentsia and one of the few remaining sources of unfiltered news and analysis. Extremists are given plenty of leeway as their presence serves only to bolster the legitimacy of the existing government, but within the mainstream of popular opinion, little dialogue is allowed. ,The kinds of discourses that result from discussions of news and politics in Russia are typically more conspiratorial than enlightening. I bet you didn’t know that the Kursk submarine was accidentally attacked by the United States and that the US Government paid the Kremlin millions of dollars to keep it a secret and let all aboard drown. Of course it was a US rocket that hit the Pentagon, how else could Bush have gotten his war approved? Of course the CIA killed Kennedy. ,Will photos of Barak Obama and Dmitri Medvedev shaking hands in the coming years change the way Russians think about race and power?  That’s the question that I most often ask my acquaintances here. That question is really the best answer to the query with which this article began. In Russia, Barak Obama winning the election is a big deal not because people wanted or expected it, but because now that it has happened, no one knows what they want or expect from it.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/barack-obama-and-russian-man-street/,"

"“A lot of sawdust written on this subject—a lot of sawdust. Don’t read any of it.”,   —Isaiah Berlin, on ‘natural law’,Last week, The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) released a controversial television advertisement in six states, including New Jersey. In the ad, twelve or so concerned-looking people of various ages and races are staggered in an eerie choir-like formation on what looks like an extremely clean hardwood floor. Behind them, foreboding clouds roll in on a green screen. What is most disorienting, however, is the horizon, which appears to be about four inches behind the backmost chorister’s heel. The space is curiously pyramidal, but in an irritatingly low-budget kind of way. The camera floats around between the characters, who each deliver a line:,   “There’s a storm gathering,” warns a blonde.,   “The clouds are dark, and the winds are strong,” adds a young redheaded guy in a suit.,   “And I am afraid,” intones a slim black woman.,   “That I’m actually watching the Weather Channel,” I thought, the first time I saw this. ,   The reality, however, was even more horrific. As it turned out, the dark clouds represent the legalization of gay marriage. The prospect of the impending storm leads the characters to try to top each other in melodrama:,   Some who advocate for same sex marriage have taken the issue far beyond same sex couples [black or Latino guy, hard to tell]…They want to bring the issue into my life [old white guy]…My freedom will be taken away [very concerned and confused looking brunette, this may actually be her off-camera persona as well]…[a few more...] But some who advocate for same sex marriage have not been content with same sex couples living as they wish…[businesswoman and possible cylon]…Those advocates want to change the way I live [another female, who looks as confused as I am at this point]…I will have no choice [woman with the skin tone of one literally trapped in a closet]… The storm is coming [Latino dude].,I found this ad as perplexing as I found it offensive, so I decided to check out NOM’s Talking Points webpage to try to figure out which rights and freedoms the group is specifically afraid of losing. At the top of the page, the group advises supporters of this type of propaganda that “Extensive and repeated polling agrees that the single most effective message is: ‘Gays and Lesbians have a right to live as they choose—they don’t have the right to redefine marriage for all of us.’ This allows people to express support for tolerance while opposing gay marriage.  [In bold] Language to avoid at all costs: ‘Ban same sex marriage.’”  I don’t know that tolerant is the word I would use in this case. Unless the alternative is arresting gays for sodomy or premarital cohabitation or just bashing them on the street, it’s not clear what is meant by “right to live as they chose.” In so far as we don’t break the law, we all have a right to live as we chose. A willingness to refrain from violently harassing or physically detaining people simply because we don’t like them is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for “tolerance” in the sense in which it is usually meant.,   Does anyone actually believe, after this ad, that anyone affiliated with NOM is not at heart a bigot? If one’s honest, though misguided, concern really lay with the question of how the state defines marriage and was not at all influenced by prejudice, would one not pause before releasing an ad that compares homosexuality to an apocalyptic storm? Granted, defenders of the cause will shake their heads at this point, muttering that another smart-aleck liberal has missed the subtle distinction between gays themselves and gay marriage. This is the crowd that claims that it is possible to object to gay marriage without being a bigot. In this article, I am calling their bluff. It is a mutually exclusive pair of positions. Let’s examine why.,   Before addressing the question of marriage itself, it’s worth thinking broadly about the question of “changing the definition of marriage” or as it is more honestly termed: the evolution of marriage. Martin Luther, in criticizing the idea of matrimony as a sacrament, famously pointed out that marriage predates religion. This is certainly so.  Marriage as a private affair has been around for a very long time, and it’s easy to see the evolutionary benefits of caring relationships, including the benefits accrued by any offspring. Eventually, these family relations were co-opted and institutionalized by religion and later by the state. Both organizations have an interest in creating stable societies and accordingly incentivize marriage. Sometimes the desire to create stability through marriage is so strong that even the feelings of the partners are ignored, as can be the case in arranged marriages, promised daughters, etc.  Western laws have drawn the lines to curb excess in different ways—in the case of the United States, fifty different ways. Clearly there is no single definition of marriage for anyone to change.,   So what can we say about marriage? Well, to keep things simple, let’s say that the state has an interest in seeing people couple. It’s not actually about children; it’s about recognizing a special relationship, and the state has a good reason to do this. In a period of population growth, the state has no interest in people having unwanted children and in period of population decline, through childbearing might be incentivized, it is never in a free state required. The state’s interest is in making its citizens dependent upon and functional within the given society, in making citizens become invested in the society’s project. This is much easier to do, when relationships are institutionalized and recognized; it provides a reward for what people will do anyway and makes people indebted to the system and dependent on it. Though certainly the state also has an interest in providing good homes for its youth, this is just one of many aspects of marriage.,   Marriage is technically a human right as defined by the UN declaration thereon, but it’s only valuable because it has privileges attached. The incentives to marry in the US include tax advantages, intestate rights, protections for child guardianship, assistance with citizenship procedures, the possibility for joint ownership of property, and a great deal else. Just being married without any privileges doesn’t get you anywhere; so, while it is in one sense a right, it’s a kind of useless one. Therefore to speak of how one’s rights are infringed by the evolution of marriage law is utter nonsense.  The only way to deprive someone of their rights in regard to marriage is to let person A marry and receive benefits, but not let person B do the same.,   I fully grant that the Declaration currently grants the right only to men and women seeking to wed each other, but the real question before any organ of power is whether the state has anything to lose by extending benefits to same sex couples such that leaving them out of the bargain is to the general good. Again, how we define marriage and those who can participate in it is in some sense arbitrary. The fact of the matter is that that the state has nothing to lose and possibly a lot to gain by recognizing gay relationships. For one thing, it makes the state a lot fairer, which is generally a good thing.,   The NOM crowd would no doubt respond to this by objecting that though the specifics of marriage have evolved, the one man-one woman principle has been consistent. I agree with this. Where I disagree is with the assumption that because this has been the case in past, it is necessarily somehow intrinsic to what marriage is. The idea that marriage can only be defined by monogamous heterosexual couples making babies, the natural law thesis NOM rests it case upon, is totally arbitrary, if like most Americans, one thinks natural law is ridiculous. We have a hard enough time explaining natural rights, but these at least protect us from demagogues.,   How is it that NOM’s only case rests on this the Catholic jargon that very few people believe in (if you’ve ever masturbated and not felt guilty, you’re already out of line)? Well, it can largely be explained by the fact that the group is fronted by Princeton’s own Professor Robert George, NOM’s cofounder and Chairmen of the Board. George is Princeton’s leading natural law expert (for whatever this is worth) and chief embarrassment. The NOM ad represents a new low for George who has spend much of his professional career fighting to curtail the rights of women, to delay the progress of science, to deny the rights of homosexuals, and mostly trivially and amusingly to shame masturbators all in the name of natural law. I call this ad a low point because, in all of the former cases, George has made his arguments without straying from what one might call the realm of reason and more-or-less good taste. The NOM ad, however, which compares homosexuality to catastrophic weather and which intentionally invokes apocalyptic themes for the benefit of a certain segment of the conservative community, is not what we generally expect of Princeton faculty. Historians are also aware of the fact that “Gathering Storm” was the title of the first volume of Churchill’s memoirs. It referred to the rise of National Socialism in Germany. Let’s let that linger for a moment. Were this the first time George has set down hate speech on Princeton letterhead, an apology to the rest of us would be in order. As it is, for the perpetual embarrassment he causes us, a resignation would be more in line.,   What can one say about the ethics of NOM, a New Jersey based nonprofit, channeling more than $1.8 million into Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative? What can one say about their other ads? A recent radio spot went: ,   [Sound of opening door] Mother: Hi Anne, what happened in school today?,   Young girl: I learned about a prince who married a prince and I can marry a princess!,   [Ominous music],   Narrator: Legalizing gay marriage has consequences for kids. Massachusetts schools teach second graders that boys can marry other boys… ,   This is so blatantly phony, so dishonest, so offensive, that I’ll wager that in thirty years time when gay marriage is legal nationwide my future children will ask me what it was like to be at Princeton during the last ride of homophobia. I’m embarrassed for Princeton, I repeat: This is not what we expect of Princeton faculty.,   It is precisely what we have come to expect, however, from George’s partner and NOM cofounder Maggie Gallagher. Gallagher gained national prominence in 2005 when she was exposed as one of the Bush Administration’s paid journalists. While a syndicated columnist with the Universal Press Syndicate and while publishing extensively on the marriage question, she was also a paid consultant for the Department of Health and Human Services and for the Department of Justice. In total, she took more than $40,000 from the government to produce in-house propaganda, but failed to see any conflict of interest. Thank god this dynamic duo has zero chance of lasting the next decade. George has his tenure—at least for now—but what will Gallager be doing in ten years?  I don’t know, but I can’t wait to see. I hope she keeps making ads, because if you can detach yourself from the filth—they’re actually kind of funny.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/george1/,"

"Berlin, 26 October,
I arrived today at 9:25. It’s now 1:30 and after my travels and brief look around I am formulating my first impressions. Though I don’t have an opinion about the country yet as a whole, concerning these people my first thought is merde (pardon my French, but yes, merde). Architecturally speaking, Berlin is revolting. The buildings are identical, the streets are identical, and everywhere there are little cupolas and pastry-like trimming. I generally have a good sense of direction, but I do not understand a single thing about this city. Somehow even more appalling is the grandiose monotony. I miss Moscow terribly and the people there… Tomorrow, I’m going to the American Consulate to get a visa and get away from here.,Berlin, 29 October,
About Berlin, I don’t even want to write about Berlin; I don’t feel like myself here. The number of stores here on the verge of bankrupcy is striking since people are buying damn-all. The depression here is unbelievable. Piles of useless goods lie around that no one can buy since no one has money. It seems impossible to believe that these burgers can hang on. And why do they earn a living at all? What do they do with their money? They squander it on idiotically dreary entertainment like the local bars.,Berlin, 30 October,
I’m on my way back from the “Scala” music hall. What rubbish! No, really, what’s with this city! There must be something interesting here other than that museum. The Pergamon part just opened, and even there the architecture is lousy.,Berlin, 1 November,
Everything here is unbelievably foreign and inscrutable, it’s so completely incompatible with my views and habits that you don’t know what to do with yourself. I hope that America, where I will have some actual work, will be better. I’m totally unaccustomed to doing nothing. This is not a vacation. This is forced idleness; yes that’s what it is. Idleness. This, and this idiotic 14-day quarantine, and this impossible one-and-a-half-weeks of just sitting on a boat is simply infuriating.,*,New York City-Hotel Manger [formerly on 7th Ave between 50 and 51st, now a Sheraton], 19 November,
Well there, I am finally in America! We came in at 7 last evening, and they had us sleep on the boat. This morning we really lucked out on the “Island of Tears” where they dragged on with the examinations until 5 in the evening. I received permission to stay for six months with the possibility of an extension should it be needed for work.,Upon first impression, I really liked the city, although it is not what I expected. First of all, its streets are filthy and the pavement is disgusting. Also the illuminated advertisements are absolutely phenomenal. I’m in living in this hotel on the twelfth floor. It’s an amazing room, about 2.5 by 3 meters. In general, it’s wonderfully comfortable.,From the sea, the skyscrapers look just like they do in the photographs, but they’re even uglier…,New York, November 20,
It has been almost a month since I left. I do not wish to judge America too rashly or hurry to lambast it as I have Europe. Here I will have more time to acquaint myself with things than I did in Europe.,Nonetheless, I want to share my first impression of New York. New York, squeezed by two rivers, produces the impression of a boil and the higher the skyscrapers the worse the boil. New York is the most grandiose social, architectural, urban absurdity that I’ve ever seen. Today I sent you a postcard from the Chrysler Building, which I have examined. Seventy-seven stories tall, it is very simple at its base and simply abominable at its top. Inside, it’s exactly the same. The walls, made of smooth, polished marble, are very nice, but the ceilings are straight out of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and looking at them makes you want to vomit. But this is still small stuff. Next to this they built (or rather are finishing) the Empire State Building, eighty-five stories with a mooring mast for an airship, and another hundred meters to the left starts a sweep, block after block, of three- or four-story hovels. They could tear it all down and build skyscrapers encircled by gardens, with light and fresh air on every side instead of these ravines. But this is, of course, impossible because then this wouldn’t be New York, America… capitalism. Again this abracadabra that was in Europe, but grandiose like everything in America, like American catastrophes.,And in New York there is absolutely no green, or rather there is Central Park, but it is a depressing eyesore…,
I insist that there is an American architecture that is terribly true to and characteristic of American culture.,New York, 24 November,
I’ve just left the movie theater; it was simply impossible to watch the filth they were showing. This entire time, I have seen only one decent film, and it was French Sous les toits de Paris. The rest, German and American, was just trash, trash, trash. I now understand why nothing of Eisen[stein] and Grisha [Grigori Aleksandrov—ed.] came out in Hollywood and why they came home. Now about the ballet. First of all there there the blacks. Splendid! I saw two who danced like Josephine Baker, only hotter…,Detroit, 26 Novemember,
About the cars: If you walk out onto the streets on a Sunday or a holiday, you will feel the horrible sensation of an empty sidewalk, while on the streets there is a solid pack of cars, from old $15 Fords up to cars that cost $10,000. Everyone drives. I even drove here and understand what a fabulous system of traffic signals they have here. They don’t use their horns unless they get caught at a stop, in which case they honk “don’t delay us”—but even this is considered rude. There are cars here everywhere, and not just for business. Cities are built here such that traveling in a car you are more likely to be late than you are to make it. In the center you can’t just stop on the street, and you need a place for parking. It costs 50-53 cents per day to park, so people take the bus to work, but then after work they will drive 50 or 60 miles. To nowhere in particular—they just drive. They’re like gypsies. There is no need to think (and for Americans this is a great relief); you just keep your eyes on the road and talk with your traveling companions…,
A man without “wheels” is not a man. He doesn’t know what to do with himself.,Here the automobile is not a means of transportation; it is a god, it is love, it is the meaning of life… The automobile has changed daily life for the people here, but not their architecture or their cities. They can’t keep building like this. How can they not understand this?,Detroit, 27 November,
Today is an American national holiday, and it is suggested that one eat a small turkey. It’s called Thanksgiving, and it’s the official holiday in the U.S. on which to remember the first colonizers of Massachusetts (it’s always the last Thursday of November). When the first pioneers had more or less settled themselves, they decided to give thanks, and since they needed to give thanks for something they went out into the woods and killed a bunch of turkeys.

"The Nassau Weekly: Professor Barry, were you born in France?,
Michael Barry: No, no. I was actually born in New York City.,NW: Then why do you publish in French?,
MB: Par-ce que j’ai grandi en France, I grew up in France., NW: And when did you move there?,
 MB: When I was three months old. My parents were very keen to have me born in the United States so that one day I could become President., NW: Ah. So what was your connection to Afghanistan as a child?,
 MB: A friend of my mother married an Afghan prince, and when I found out about it as a teenager, I was so excited by this strange country over there whose photographs I was seeing that I begged to be invited. I spent my summers there.,NW: When you go to Kabul today, do you see the Kabul of your childhood surviving anywhere?,
MB: The Kabul that once existed now, in a sense, no longer exists. The Kabul that once existed was a little city of 300,000 people with pristine mountain air and most of the population living a very traditional life in mud wall compounds with drinking water they got out of their wells. You had a small core that was beginning to be westernized, but the majority of the population was still very traditional. The city was intimately connected with its surrounding countryside, fresh vegetable produce being brought in by peasants with their donkeys, which would trot out of the city in the evenings with refuse, including human refuse for the fields. The city was essentially flushing itself out in the traditional way. This city basically survived intact under Soviet rule, because the Mujahedeen were unable to accomplish more than pinpricks on Kabul itself, even though Kabul failed to control the countryside. When the Soviets withdrew, however, Kabul began to be destroyed between opposing factions, one of which was supported fully by the Pakistani military that gave the Islamist factions, namely the Pashtuns, overwhelming firepower, which leveled part of Kabul. So Kabul, physically, was to a large extend damaged in the 1990s after the Soviet withdrawal. The Northern Alliance withdrew from Kabul in September 1996, realizing that Pakistani supplied firepower was such that the Taliban would be able to flatten the city completely. They withdrew in order to avoid the complete destruction of Kabul, so the Taliban moved in and occupied it.,Meanwhile, the degradation of Afghan life that had begun under Soviet rule and continued during the factional fighting, the seeding of the Afghan countryside with anti-personnel mines made so much of the countryside unsafe that peasants poured into the city, trying to find safe refuge and perhaps a place where the international presence might handout food. The population of Kabul today is more than four million people. To me the abiding disgrace of the American period that replaces the Taliban period—remember that we own it, in the sense that we have militarily occupied it since the end of 2001—is that the water supply of Kabul and the sewage system have not been expanded.,The result is that Kabul is a colossal mess of raw sewage seeping into and further polluting the central river, which is a bed of typhus and cholera. The people who live in low-rent mud shanties hugging the sides of the hills that surround Kabul must collect their water from what spigots they can find in the city center. The city center itself is occupied by the foreign quarter where rents are now as high as $10,000 a month for a decent compound with security, which means that the only people who are there—well, it’s become a kind of international ghetto in the heart of the city, which ordinary Afghans can’t even penetrate. That ghetto has all the modern amenities including water that is flown in from the United States or Europe, but outside that there is a seething cesspool of absolute misery, worse than in 1960s or 1970s. The local discontent in Kabul itself has fed into anti-foreign perceptions throughout the country:,NW: How did you come to be in Afghanistan around the time of the Soviet period? You were there in lieu of doing what, if you take my meaning?,
MB: In lieu of nothing. I was interested in the archeology of the area, and when the pro-Soviet government took over in April 1978 I was already in academia at McGill working with both the English and the French. I was beginning to get many, many stories of repression and mass executions being carried out in Kabul. And I was contacted increasingly in 1979 by international organizations like Amnesty International and the International Federation of Human Rights. I took a very fateful decision: I said that I cannot go on in academia in medieval archeology and art. I cannot turn my back on a people whose language I speak and with whom I lived as a young person.,So, I became involved in humanitarian work. First, I was the representative of the International Federation of Human Rights, with whom I investigated human rights violations from 1979 to 1984. I was based in Paris, but constantly going into Afghanistan clandestinely until a saturation point in 1984, when I knew that I did not want to register another human rights atrocity; I wanted to do something more constructive, like humanitarian assistance. ,I was then contacted by Bernard Kouchner, who’s currently the French Foreign Minister, but who at that time was the head of Doctors of the World. He asked me to take over their Afghani and Pakistani operations, which I did. We were bringing in food, medicine, and medical volunteers clandestinely across from Pakistani to Afghanistan and were helped by those populations that are now revolting against us. They were anti-Soviet, and I was able to move through large portions of the country until the Soviet withdrawal. I continued doing this with the United Nations between 1989 and 1994 as a team leader delivering assistance; I got to see a lot the country that way.,After the Taliban takeover, I felt that I really had no further purpose in Afghanistan; I wouldn’t work for that type of government. I did whatever I could from Europe: supporting girls’ schools, speaking at fundraisers, these kinds of things. I finished my PhD, and I thought that when the Taliban was overthrown in 2001 that chapter was closed and that Afghanistan could carry on with international assistance. ,NW: Where you at all surprised by the recently reported news that President Obama is seriously reconsidering the troop surge promised in January, particularly under pressure from his Vice President?,
MB: No, the United States is paying the price of the Bush Administration’s humanitarian neglect and has to consider the fact that while more troops will provide security for technical reconstruction, they will also provide fodder for xenophobic resentment, alienation, and the sense that the United States is an occupying force. The United States is caught in the horns of a dilemma, much like the British or the Russians were. They chose to withdraw, figuring that Afghan hostility could be contained geographically and even modified by assistance to this or that chief. Bin Laden’s plan in allying himself with the Taliban has been to threaten the United States explicitly and to turn, once again, Afghanistan into a base, impregnable now, from which to launch attacks against American interests. He may not carry out those threats, but bin Laden and Al-Qaeda are doing their very best to make those threats credible in order to force the United States into staying as an occupying force in Afghanistan. He wants to bleed American troops. That’s bin Laden’s plan. So I can understand any American administration weighing whether it is wise to pursue a strategy that Al-Qaeda seems to be inviting.,NW: Is there any chance that Afghanistan will eventually be given back to Pakistan as it essentially was before the Taliban régime? Could there be an understanding that Islamabad can again organize the government in Kabul, but this time they can’t prop up Sunni fundamentalists?,
MB: Anything can happen, truly anything can happen, but we’re also seeing in the region a shift in the pieces of the puzzle, a return to major preponderance of certain regional powers…,NW: India and Iran?,
MB: Yes and Russia, which may be coming back if only because of the Iranian-Russian tie, which brings them right to the heart of the region anyway. These players will be extremely active in the Afghan field with or without an American withdrawal.,NW: Is anything better than the Taliban?,
MB: I would compare the Taliban in Islamic terms to the Khmer Rouge in Marxist-Leninist terms. So nothing gets worse than that, which means that if America withdraws from Afghanistan and the kind of Taliban régime we saw in the 1990s returns to power, then it will be a humanitarian tragedy of Cambodian proportion. That may not happen, or it very well may.,NW: Professor Barry, thank you so much.,

"Detroit, 27 November (cont’d.),[After eating some turkey] we decided to drive around together in “the car” (here everyone calls automobiles “cars”).,We spent an hour trying to crank up “the car.” It turned out that the battery had died and we ended up shoving it to the nearest gasoline station. The shoving was rather difficult as it is beastly cold out, everything is covered in snow, and we were slipping around like we were on skis. Eventually we got going in the direction of Ford’s Hayland Park Factory, but we had to spend an hour looking for the right route. We arrived. Frozen, we went into a bar to drink coffee and even there they were photographing us. If I ever get the prints, I’ll send some.,Detroit, 28 November,My work is little by little starting to come together, but it’s difficult to seize the bull by the horns in America and make a good assessment of industrial construction. But nevertheless, I will figure it out!  Around here, the architecture is very boring. Along with the architects themselves there are these enormous bureaus. It’s a “business,” and these days it’s a dirty one at that. I will tell you at great length about how they do design here. Upon first impression, it seems that one guy does the draft, a second does the plan, a third the façade, a fourth the interior, a fifth, sixth, and on into the -teens and so forth the electricity, the construction, the plumbing, the sewage, the ventilation, the heating and cooling, and so on. The office boss then approves all of this without having any actual connection to any of it. What you get is an American work of art.,About technology, I will say little, since this idea has its own meaning in America that has no perceptible relationship to tempo. It seems that this is because no one here actually does anything; they try to build and produce as little as possible, so that they don’t all go bust. Nonetheless, they build new buildings—what actually goes on in them is unclear. It seems entirely unfathomable—why? Stranger still is the answer. It turns out that if a factory owner builds a new building, he doesn’t pay any taxes on it. But in order to build he needs money, so he sacks 5000 workers, leaving him with money in his pocket and new buildings. These buildings and factory shells do nothing. It’s phenomenally absurd. And about the skyscrapers: If this is some kind of stupid joke, I don’t get it. They are downright pustules on an idiotic urban plan, the consequences of which affect the whole system. When you ride the express elevator down from the 70th floor, your blood pulses out your ears. The pressure hits you just like in an airplane.,Detroit, 29 November,Another word on Paris. Of course it is an exceptionally beautiful city. Absence has made my heart grow fonder still, especially when one compares it with the others—Berlin, New York, London…,Concerning Corbusier: He is an exceptional master, but if you won’t see his defects, then you’ll never surpass him yourself. I’m glad that I can discern these defects.,More about this and other matters another time. Today, my head is empty…,Detroit, 30 November,…I sent you two pictures of me with our engineers. They’re great guys! The photographs were taken before our trip out of town on the “Holiday of the Turkeys.” As you’ll see in the pictures, I haven’t exactly been “wasting away.” I’m looking at some structures and chatting with some of the local architects including A. Kahn. His brother had told me that he would introduce me to [A. Khan] “the greatest architect in the world.” Swell, huh? He built all the Ford plants, and they’re really not bad, except that as architecture they are simply awful.,Talking about my stuff, he said that it was very talented work, but that in 200 years we would see who’s right–him or me.,I answered that I have absolutely no pretensions to the classical or faith that my buildings will still be standing in 200 years. We must hurry to make the architectural industrial, but any industrial thing will age quickly, because industry does not stand in one place, and new things appear quickly.,How wonderful that they pretend to History, to Eternity! How tasteless and pretentious.,Later he showed me a project for a school and asked what I thought.,I said that the principles of horizontality and verticality were inverted.,His answer: “I acknowledge neither principles nor theory in architecture. I desire beauty.” Really, huh? Like a little birdie of grace. We then examined his project for the “Fischer Building.” Before seeing it, I was warned that I was about to see the greatest building in the world. But once again, the most spectacular spaces turned out to be the closets. Walls of white tile and partitions of thick black glass held together by nickel-plated bolts. Everything else was of marble and bronze. ,And again experience, no sort of theory, no design, it’s all very vague. Upon arriving I gave an excellent little speech in American about the cities, the toilets, and “experience” in architecture. All the secondary things are done well here. If America had no architects, it would have been a much prettier—or at least a much less ugly—country. What’s more, if you ask an American: “Why? Why have you done all this?”—“I don’t know. That’s how they do it. Experience!” That’s how it goes…,Detroit, 1 December,…New York is the most loathsome city in the world. I have written you before about this. Staring tomorrow, I will be surveying factories, and the next letter, probably, will be about the Ford plants and some others. In a few days, I’ll be going to Chicago since they have buildings there with steel walls. All the time, I think about what interests me most about America—the mass production of houses. But it’s not at all well-advised—they don’t need to mass produce houses, since may old ones stand empty. The whole notion of business here is extremely lousy. They build little, buy less, and yet sell everything. Only the movie houses are full, and what filth they produce and screen! The sole entertainment here is the automobile, but today was the first day of sunshine.",http://www.nassauweekly.com/letters-west-part-ii/,"

" [1],
—Theodor Adorno,THE SHOOTING,The day after President Nixon’s announcement of an imminent US invasion of Cambodia, a group of Kent State University history graduate students—calling themselves World Historians Opposed to Racism and Exploitation (WHORE)—convened an anti-war rally on the Commons, a central area of the campus often used for outdoor meetings. As it was a Friday, students packed the local bars later that evening. The mood was one of resentment at the escalation of the war in the face of the President’s earlier indications of pending disengagement. As the night of drinking wore on, some of the students poured out into street, where they ignited a bonfire. In response, Kent’s mayor ordered an early closing time for the bars, a decision that resulted in further swelling of the crowd. An unknown number of drunken students smashed several dozen shop and car windows before being herded back onto campus. The next evening, unidentified individuals—later determined to have been mostly non-students—burned down the campus’ wooden ROTC building. It was at this point that the Ohio National Guard was called in.,Sunday, May 3, 1970, proved to be a day of high tensions between the National Guard and the students, many of whom were apathetic towards the war but felt put upon by the continued presence of armed troops on their campus. The institution of a confusing curfew policy and a seemingly total breakdown of authority on campus put students in the mood to march. A demonstration was planned for noon on Monday. In comparison with the activities of the past weekend, Monday’s gathering began in relative calm. Nevertheless, the Guardsmen ordered the students to disperse and—irritated with their noncompliance—tear-gassed the crowd before advancing upon them. The troops were met with return volleys of empty tear gas canisters whose contents had harmlessly dissipated in the afternoon breeze. The Guardsmen continued to push the students back.,The confrontation continued this way for twenty minutes, until the troops were ordered to regroup at the top of a grassy knoll popularly known as Blanket Hill. (The nickname referred to the amorous, moonlit intentions of the knoll’s typically unarmed occupants.) The Guardsmen’s reversal necessitated turning their backs to the students, some of whom began throwing rocks and other debris. At the top of hill and for reasons that remain unclear to this day, several of the Guardsmen turned and fired their weapons on the students, killing four and wounding nine. [2],The public outcry at the events of May 4 in which Allison Krause, Sandy Schreuer, Jeffery Miller and William Schroeder—himself a ROTC student—lost their lives was international, immediate, and divided. Opinion was spilt between those devastated by the loss of four students and those angered that in a time of war, Americans would side with rowdy students against young men in uniform. In the United States, Neil Young composed the hit song, “Ohio,” which attempted to capture both the grief of American youth and their frustration with President Nixon, whose tepid response to news of the shootings alienated many. As the song’s haunting refrain put it:,_Tin soldiers and Nixon’s coming,
We’re finally on our own,
This summer I hear the drumming,
Four dead in Ohio…_,In Moscow, the poet Evgeny Yevtushenko composed a poem dedicated to Allison Krause, which appeared in the Communist Party organ , later that spring. Titled “Tsvety i puli” or “Flowers and Bullets,” the poem begins, “Tot, kto lyubit tsvety,/ Tot, estestvenno, pulyam ne nravitsya…” (Those who love flowers are, naturally, unloved by bullets.) At the other end of the spectrum, numerous letters to the local newspapers defended the National Guard and blamed the students for their misfortune. [3] The university, shattered by its loss, made efforts to comfort its surviving students through the end of the academic term. It proved far more resistant, however, to formally commemorating the tragedy with a monument.,MEMORY AND ART: THE PREPARATION FOR A MEMORIAL AT KENT STATE,In 1977, with no formal memorial yet erected worth the name, the Kent State administration announced its intention to commence construction of a gym annex long planed for a site adjacent to that of the shootings. The decision sparked protests from groups across the country, not least from Kent State students. Numerous makeshift protest organizations arrived at the campus, including the YOUTH INTERNATIONAL PARTY, which distributed fliers promising to “spell the name of the fucked-up state of (ohio) in a fucked up way (OHIGHO). [sic]” Their activities including pieing Governor James Rhodes—the man who had authorized the calling-up of the Guard—in addition to leaders of conservative pro-administration groups like Citizens Concerned with Preservation of Law and Order in Portage County. [4],Tragically, the frustration felt by Americans of all ages and political leanings was most vocally and visibly expressed by the fringes of the left. Protestors constructed a tent community at the proposed building site during the summer of 1977 and delayed, but failed to prevent, the gym’s construction through court actions. [5] Students and other interested parties formed the May 4th Coalition to fight for more fitting recognition of the tragedy, but such actions only inspired more vitriol from Ohioans unaffiliated with the university. While the pile of preserved letters from Ohioans to the university and to the press in 1977 contain many ungrammatical, chicken scratched rants against Jews, communists, and assorted other third-party minorities, even the statements typed neatly on professional letterhead were largely unequivocal in their opposition to the protestors. Kenneth S. Hoard, a local contractor, complained:,“Every person taking part in tearing down the fencing around the site of the new gymnasium should have been arrested and severely punished. Reasoning for the action was and is stupid. The shooting of the rabble-rousers a couple of years back was the best thing that ever happened…We just cannot afford to permit these radicals, who contribute nothing, to burn and pillage at will. In fact we cannot afford to lock them up and care for them in jails with ice cream and colored television. These creatures should be eliminated without fanfare.” [6],Kenneth Foote, professor of geography at University of Colorado at Boulder, has described how “[s]hame can be a powerful motive to obliterate reminders of tragedy and violence,” but that the “element of denial that lies at the heart of obliteration can block this process of bereavement.” [7] Kent State’s ham-handed effort to write the shooting—and its controversial meaning—out of history with a gym annex succeeded only in reopening old wounds. When students and parents held a vigil that May, one victim’s mother attended, telling a reporter, “I’m sorry we weren’t here before…We didn’t know this still mattered here.” [8] Meanwhile, the local B’nai B’rith Hillel group placed a small metal plaque at Kent State in 1971. This was replaced in 1975 with a modest gravestone memorial sponsored by the faculty, but not, tellingly, the administration. [9],Though no official memorial appeared at Kent State until 1990, to argue that the university was categorically unsympathetic to the desire to commemorate the shootings would be unfair. The problem lay not in the intentions of the administration, but rather in their inability to conceptualize what kind of memorial they, their students, their neighbors, and posterity could live with. While, on one level, the student body and, on another, the nation saw themselves as part of an aggrieved constituency of the tragedy, Kent State, as a public institution, also felt bound to an intermediate and far less sympathetic echelon, that of the Ohio taxpayer. While the , complained in an October 1977 editorial—“[t]he proposal by the university’s president, Bradge Golding, to honor all the parties involved in the tragic confrontation, including the National Guard, was remarkably insensitive,” and that “[t]o honor the killers would be to insult the victims”—this was not a sentiment necessarily shared by the families of the Ohio National Guard. [10] Neither did it help matters that the courts had, in the meantime, cleared the Guardsmen of criminal guilt in the shooting. Yet, were the May 4th Coalition’s claim that “you [Kent State] want to build a gym and cover up your wrongdoing,” entirely correct, it would be hard to explain the events of the following year. [11],POLITICS AND ART: THE RECEPTION OF A MEMORIAL AT KENT STATE,In January 1978, Peter Putnam, of the Mildred Andrews Foundation, contacted the university.12 He wished to issue the internationally known sculptor George Segal a $100,000 commission for a commemorative statute to be presented to Kent State. The university accepted. [13],On February 23, having agreed to consider the commission, Segal received a $10,000 check—the first installment for materials and ten percent of the total—from Putnam with instructions to cash it if he agreed to accept the terms outlined in the accompanying letter. Segal would be obliged to “visit the Kent State Campus to consult on the project, as well as prepare preliminary drawings and photo-collages on the basis of which the university will make its final decision [on accepting or rejecting the gift].” Further, Putnam wrote, “In the very unlikely event that they decide not to go ahead with the piece, you will deliver all preliminary drawings, photo-collages, and any other relevant work on the project done by you to the Museum at Kent State College.” Segal found the proposed amount to be adequate, but balked at the suggestion that he should have to surrender any of his work to an institution that would so little value it. [14] On March 10, he called Putnam to express his concerns. Putnam agreed to a revision of the contract and put it in writing that same day:,“[T]his is to agree to a modification of our earlier contract, allowing you to keep all drawings, photocollages, etc., related to your proposal to Kent State University, if the University rejects your proposal…. In the unlikely event of a rejection of our proposal by Kent State, the Mildred Andrews fund retains the right to go ahead with the commissioning for itself, on the same basis as in the contract sent to you, with the sculpture to be delivered, along with photocollages, drawings, and photos of work in progress, to such a place in the U.S.A., as the Mildred Andrews Fund may designate. I hope it does not come to that, but if the trustees find your conception offensive, we’ll just put it somewhere else.” [15],Originally Putnam had included Professor Stuart Schar, Director of the Kent State School of Art, as the sole copied recipient of the second letter, but on Segal’s copy, held by the Rare Books Collection of Princeton, Schar’s name is crossed out. Either Segal crossed it out himself or Putnam did, deciding to contact Schar separately, as two days later Putnam advised Segal:,“Please keep the modification in our contract confidential, between the two of us. Hopefully, it will never be relevant. Stuart Schar feels that to bring it up now would create an unnecessary sour or at least ambiguous note. Kent State does not have a copy or know about it, but they (i.e. Schar) are in agreement that we will do just what it provides if Kent rejects your proposal.” [16],Though perhaps the university administration should have been wise enough to deduce that Segal would find a way to protect both his commission and his artistic integrity, it is clear from the documents that Bradge Golding, the president of the university, had no knowledge of the deal tacitly agreed to by the faculty member. In retrospect, Schar’s obvious lack of confidence in the president and trustees proved quite reasonable.,In early March, Segal flew to Ohio to meet with school officials and to view the prospective site for his sculpture. He had been briefed in a letter from Schar that a recent polling of students had found that eighty-six percent favored “a general theme to commemorate activities which provide ‘peace and brotherhood with a commitment to cooperation for a better future,’” for any future commemorative events and that thirteen percent desired a theme “‘expressing need for social change focusing on social injustice.’” [17] Upon arriving at the campus—where he remained for less than a day—Segal shared his plan for the statue with Schar and Golding: a dramatic scene from the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. Segal left the meeting confident of their enthusiastic support and “full cooperation,” though of course his commission was no longer dependent upon their eventual acceptance of the final proposal. [18] Putnam agreed that things were “off to a good start.” [19],As promised in the January contract, on May 31 Segal sent Golding a large black and white drawing of his concept along with photographs of the work in progress. He asked that these be submitted to the “committee for acceptance or rejection of the conception by the University.” [20] The sketch depicted an older, bearded figure standing above a kneeling, shirtless younger man with bound hands. The bearded man held a knife. “The students struck me as genuinely idealistic in their demonstrations against the spreading of the war into Cambodia,” Segal wrote to President Golding, “yet so single-minded they disregarded law, democratic process, and wittingly or unwittingly, fanned the fears of those in charge.” Segal saw the events of May 4, 1970, through a generational, rather than a political, prism:,“The older people had…equated patriotism with obedience, were convinced of a Communist and Anarchist threat to our political structure, and a sexual threat to our religious morality. The fevered encounter between the students and the National Guardsmen reminded me strongly of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his only son…because God had ordered him to, i.e. he believed in an invisible, difficult abstraction.”,Far from providing an image of “peace and brotherhood” or a call for “cooperation for a better future,” Segal offered to, in his own words, drain “the puss from the sore.” [21] Segal’s aim was to give voice to the sufferings of the students, but at the same time show the complexity of the tragedy’s dramatic tension. “The only fact we can agree on,” Segal wrote, “is that parents still have the power to either kill or nurture their young. The issues are difficult and contradictory.” [22] Fairly or not, Segal saw in the Kent State affair the whole history of Western civilization’s grappling with devotion, violence, and fear.,A month later on June 28, Golding and his chief assistant, Dr. Robert McCoy, drafted a letter to Segal outlining their committee’s concerns not with the artistic merit of the piece, but rather with the political fallout of “viewers see[ing] your Isaac as a ‘student-victim’ and your Abraham as a ‘National Guardsman-assassin.’” [23] While recognizing that Kent State’s falling enrollment was linked to the university’s “failure to recognize and to cope with the significance of the May 4th experience,” Golding was concerned that “the gift of a major work of art, executed by the nation’s leading sculptor… [should be] part of the solution, not a new problem.” [24] In short, Kent State wanted a quick solution to the charges of insensitivity that had dogged its officials since 1970, alleged insensitivity not diminished by the repeated placement of the word victims in quotation marks throughout Golding’s draft. The pair decided not to send the letter for fear of appearing to pressure Segal’s artistic autonomy. But McCoy, dispatched to visit Segal later that month, gave the artist a copy of the draft anyway. [25] It read, in part:,Is there a way to reduce the possibilities for negative interpretation and still retain the idea that ‘parents still have the power to either kill or nurture their young?’… If you were to select the next moment in the story where both Abraham and Isaac were looking aside to the where the ram was miraculously caught in the thicket, would you be able to express what you believe to be appropriate? Several ideas seem possible with respect to the idea of substitution. The purpose of education is to dis- place thoughtless actions with reasonable solutions. The ostensible purpose of the national demonstrations by the ‘doves’ in the late sixties was to try to substitute their point of view for that of the ‘hawks.’… It would be possible for some to see Abraham as the United States, Isaac as Vietnam, and the ram as the Kent State four, with peace as the outcome… That’s our raison d’etre: to substitute knowledge for ignorance. And isn’t it also a function of art, to make thought and feeling visible? … The shift in focus to the substitute would perhaps give us the sense of resolution most of us are seeking at Kent State. [26],Golding clearly wished Segal to radically alter his concept in order to create a fully transparent—i.e. uncontroversial—memorial, and it would appear that he also believed that his own suggestion would equally serve the purposes of art. The letter even proposed dropping the Abraham and Isaac theme altogether in favor of “a vigorous male of 18 or 19, with a powerful bare torso,” standing with his rifle across his chest as he is dissuaded from violence by a “female contemporary… [either] nude or semi-nude.” [27] Segal reportedly laughed out loud at the suggestion and asked McCoy if he was behind the second suggestion, which he was. [28] This second concept was apparently inspired by a recent incident at an anti-war protest in Washington, DC, though it may also have reflected the populist desire to see “the boys who lost their lives in Vietnam, not the law-breakers,” commemorated. [29],President Golding continued to labor under the delusion that he had some authority over the progress of the commission, though in reality, Segal received his checks regularly and on schedule from the Foundation. [30] Neither Segal nor Putnam believed that Kent State would actually refuse a free gift of a $100,000 statue, even if it dragged its heels in determining how it would justify the acquisition to a skeptical local public. [31] From the beginning, however, both were prepared to donate the statue elsewhere.,On July 27, McCoy wrote to Segal and telephoned Putnam. In the letter he indicated that though he was writing before the final authorization of the project, he had been instructed to inform the artist “…that we have accepted your theme,” provided that a permanent plaque be installed with Genesis 22 (the Abraham and Isaac story) inscribed to contextualize the piece. McCoy explained the committee’s delay in terms of its obligations to diverse constituencies. “It is simply not possible,” McCoy wrote, “in the summertime to carry through all of the processes that we know from experience are important in maintaining good communicative,
rapport with our many publics.” [32] Segal was amenable to the suggestion of a plaque and put the wheels in motion for one to be cast. Before the month was out, however, the opinion of the committee at Kent State had soured.,On August 23, the committee flatly rejected the Abraham and Isaac concept and a week later issued a statement announcing their view that it was “inappropriate to commemorate the deaths of four persons and the wounding of nine, on the University campus, with a statue which appears to represent an act of violence about to be committed.” [33] The press release indicated that McCoy had met with Segal earlier that year to convey the university’s reservations, but did not mention McCoy’s subsequent communiqués of July 27 in which approval was unofficially assured. More importantly, the university did not elaborate on why the concept was deemed “inappropriate.” The administration’s decision was widely, though by no means universally, condemned by students and alumni, local and national editorial boards, and members of the Art Department at Kent State as a sign of cowardice, arrogance, parochialism or some combination thereof. [34],It did not help matters that, in the course of the negative publicity engendered by the refusal of a valuable gift and the failure yet again to commemorate the dead, the university attempted to put the blame on Segal for inadequate consultation during the planning process. In response to these charges, Segal—in a letter to Kent State students which was later published in the ,—mentioned that while that summer the president had indicated his preference for “a nude young girl using her feminine charms to deflect a young soldier from using his gun,” he, as an artist, was interested in “full, open examination of the painful issue with moral and human issues added to the legal and political ones.” [35],On the same day that Kent State refused the sculpture, Peter Bunnell, the outgoing director of the Princeton Art Museum, wrote to Putnam assuring him that “I will discuss with [my replacement Fred Licht] all the pending projects of the Putnam Collection.” [36] The Putnam family correspondence file maintained by the Princeton Art Museum contains no references to Segal during the summer of 1978, but that Bunnell should refer to “the pending projects of the Putnam Collection,” on the same day that , was refused raises important questions: When, perhaps informally, was the idea suggested that Princeton might serve as an alternate home for ,? Who proposed it? And why? Why, for instance, did it not go to a public organization or to another college in Ohio, where its impact would be more immediate? These are questions that demand further inquiry.,What is certain is that Kent State lost an opportunity for cost-free commemoration and in so doing succeeded once again in alienating many of its students and faculty. The administration had hoped that the imprimatur,
of an artist like Segal would lend credibility to an inoffensive design that would, by sublimating the tragedy of May 4, 1970, into a vague portrait of Vietnam-era social tensions, appease the right “publics” without irritating others. Segal, however, refused to obscure, rather than explore, the uncomfortable relationship of violence to power or the meaning of the campus’ loss.,It would be another twelve and a half years before Kent State would finally dedicate a permanent monument in 1990. In an attempt to avoid a second Segal-like incident, a design competition for the memorial was held in 1985-1986 and was won by a team comprised of the Michigan-based designer Ian Taberner and the New York-based Michael Fahey. The first prize was $20,000. The competition rules stipulated that contestants had to be American citizens, a stipulation which Taberner, a Canadian, failed to notice. Upon being striped of the prize, Taberner sued the university for $2 million, claiming a civil rights violation. The university, under pressure from Kent State survivors, paid out $15,000 settlement and went ahead with the runner-up design despite opposition from the Ohio Fraternity of Police, the Ohio Unit of the American Legion, and at least one state senator—a Vietnam veteran. [37],Serious budget constraints and a failure to raise adequate funds prompted a serious scaling down of the proposed memorial project, with a spending cap of $100,000 imposed by the Board of Trustees. A report in the Stater that the incumbent university president Michael Schwartz had announced the dedication by means of a $49,000 ad campaign in Ohio newspapers prompted that paper’s editorial board to conclude that the administration had “placed the importance of public relations for the dedication on almost the same level as the memorial itself.” [38] The memorial has been criticized by commentators for its vagueness and illegibility as a tribute to the memory of the victims. [39],For a work of art born into such controversy and so unfailingly misunderstood, it is perhaps fitting that it should now stand in the shadow of our chapel, neglected and inscrutable to all but the handful who squint at its plaque. For some, it is a Kierkegaardian ornament to the campus’ spiritual corner. To many more, it is just “the blow job statue,” a compliment to the enormous phallus outside the E-quad and the “Living Swastika” which graces the lawn in front of Prospect House. In its obscurity, it continues to raise the question for all who would consider it of whether art can or should address functional social needs. Is the horror of memory better overcome by questions or by answers? And why did four students die on May 4, 1970?,[1] Theodor Adorno, “Commitment,” in Ernst Bloch et al., , (London, 1980), 188-9.,
