some notes: 
1. word type is the type of n gram

2. number of topics is the number of topics for that word type

3. vocab distribution is a paremeter vector 
summing to one which is a distribution over the probability of each word showing up in a topic

4. global alphas are global dirichlet parameters. must be positive but need not sum to 1. 

5. per author authors are dirichlets for each author. must be positive but need not sum to 1. 

6. to get proportions from dirichlet vector v, return v = v/sum_i v[i]

7. etas are logistic regresion parameter: there are (number of authors - 1) etas but these are not useful for the visualizer so dont read etas
